8655,"Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed.",Doyle

8669,“I will tell you the true solution of the matter.,Doyle
8670,"It is true that ‘For Mrs. Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H.

10807,I burst immediately into indignant speech.,Christie
10808,Poirot shook his head gravely.,Christie

10854,"With her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being  paid, that was indeed something to take into consideration.",Christie
10855,I must fix it up with him.,Christie
10856,"“Ah, that is not what I want.",Christie
10857,“Only her powders?”,Christie
10858,It had got its name from its resemblance to a man's head-an American Indian  profile.,Christie
10859,"Neatly arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.”",Christie
10860,But Caroline’s words had reminded me of something.,Christie
10861,“You’ll be able to keep up the place all right?”,Christie
10862,From below them came the boom of a gong.,Christie
10863,He turned to the others.,Christie

10865,"He talks little, and what he does say is said jerkily, as though the words were forced out of him unwillingly.",Christie

10867,I ask you nothing—but you will be my ally.,Christie
10868,“The air is pleasant to-day.”,Christie
10869,Caroline was hovering by my elbow.,Christie
10870,A spasm of pain crossed his face.,Christie
10871,It was now complete and the coping stone to it was an interview I had  with a doctor in Harley Street.,Christie
10872,"“If you’ll excuse me, sir, Miss Flora saw him after that.”",Christie
10873,“By you?”,Christie
10874,They will demand what my idea is.,Christie

10876,"There were sounds of bolts and locks, of the moving of furniture.",Christie
10877,He was implicated in that share-pushing fraud of Bennito's three  years ago-we're sure of that though we can't prove it.,Christie
10878,Blunt nodded.,Christie
10879,"“_Point No. 2._—At some time during the evening Ralph Paton must have come in through the window, as evidenced by the prints of his shoes.",Christie

10884,God forgive me if I am wronging him!”,Christie

10893,“Good heavens!”,Christie
10894,He stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass.,Christie
10895,"His name, apparently, is Mr. Porrott—a name which conveys an odd feeling of unreality.",Christie
10896,"They lose control, you know, without being able to help it.”",Christie
10897,"Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly taken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‘Poison’!",Christie

10901,"Possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it.",Christie
10902,“I did not recognize them.”,Christie
10903,"He wouldn’t even buy new face towels, though I told him the old ones were in holes.",Christie
10904,"Any one could have gone up to the woman's bedroom then without  being seen.""",Christie
10905,“I shouldn’t put so much stress on the footmarks if it wasn’t for everything else.”,Christie

10907,"Can you-bring some sticks to light the  fire?""",Christie
10908,"“Yes, but this affair is more important.”",Christie
10909,"And nodding his head at them in a sage manner, he walked out into the street.",Christie
10910,I must say——”  But I stopped suddenly.,Christie
10911,I said incredulously.,Christie

10913,“Yes;,Christie
10914,Their eyes met again.,Christie
10915,"Her eyes, staring frightened eyes,  went round and round the ring of faces.",Christie
10916,"Then he raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.",Christie

10926,"Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of the opinion that it was rather earlier.",Christie
10927,"John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the window as it swept past.",Christie
10928,"As I was saying, if you ask me, Flora’s been exceedingly lucky.",Christie
10929,"But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather lack of evidence.",Christie
10930,“Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity.”,Christie
10931,It was Poirot who spoke.,Christie
10932,"Whoever it  was who enticed us here, that person knows or has taken the trouble to find  out a good deal about us all.",Christie
10933,"Then, slowly and deliberately, he shook his head.",Christie
10934,“I should not think it likely.”,Christie
10935,Landor was innocent  right enough.,Christie
10936,"“Not that it matters very much,” said Caroline, reading my expression correctly.",Christie
10937,He supposed so.,Christie
10938,“Why not?” asked my sister triumphantly.,Christie

10957,"She said, more  composedly:   ""I don't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm.""",Christie

10972,He made up his mind.,Christie
10973,I said quickly.,Christie
10974,"The sound I had heard, therefore, could not have been that of a window being shut down.",Christie
10975,Poirot and the lawyer looked at each other.,Christie
10976,"The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness.",Christie

10998,They went through the few outbuildings first  and then turned their attention to the building itself.,Christie

11000,"“Delighted,” said Caroline.",Christie
11001,“I will remember.,Christie
11002,The judge looked at him unblinkingly.,Christie

11018,She had had a visit from Poirot and was very pleased and important about it.,Christie
11019,“But those stairs only lead to Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom.”,Christie
11020,"“Curious,” said Poirot again.",Christie
11021,"“All this,” I said, “is very interesting—but hardly in the sphere of practical politics.”",Christie

13577,"Why, again?",Christie
13578,"But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge against my friend’s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still more ancient mallet.",Christie
13579,"“Someone with a good deal of intelligence,” remarked Poirot dryly.",Christie
13580,But it is truly an ingenious supposition.”,Christie
13581,“Really?,Christie
13582,There had been its original purchase by an American millionaire who was crazy  about yachting-and an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on  this little island off the Devon coast.,Christie
13583,But I’ve seen all along that it wouldn’t be better for Ralph—it makes the case against him blacker than ever.,Christie
13584,"“About six o’clock, sir.”",Christie
13585,“Did he send her to you with that message?”,Christie
13586,"""You agree.",Christie

13589,The butler came forward bowing slightly.,Christie
13590,"“I am answered,” said Poirot, with a curious laugh.",Christie
13591,Do you see what I mean?”,Christie
13592,His eyes turned slowly till they rested on her.,Christie
13593,"Cynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her, and told her of Poirot’s wish to visit the dispensary.",Christie
13594,"But for espionage, _mon ami_.”",Christie
13595,"Lombard said:   ""Who do you plump for?""",Christie

13664,"You see, I—er—know the parties concerned better than he does.",Christie
13665,It was slightly more  assured-easier in tone.,Christie

13667,"Instance, the Rogerses'.",Christie
13668,I have always been considered so—so very respectable.,Christie
13669,"I understood him, and I was sorry—because I’m the same underneath.",Christie

13676,More’n once too.,Christie
13677,I asked solicitously.,Christie
13678,"“Every one’s,” repeated the inspector fussily.",Christie
13679,"For he had a knack, that one, of stumbling over the truth unawares—without noticing it himself, _bien entendu_.",Christie
13680,John and the lawyer looked at him startled.,Christie
13681,"If Inspector Raglan permits me to assist him, I shall be both honored and flattered.”",Christie
13682,"Inside, Mr. Justice Wargrave  said with due legal caution:   ""Beautiful weather we are having.""",Christie

13685,“That is Mrs. Raikes.”,Christie
13686,Lombard sat down again.,Christie
13687,Blore looked unconvinced.,Christie
13688,"I was hurt, and showed it.",Christie
13689,There was silence.,Christie
13690,"“No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.”",Christie
13691,"She’s in a terrible way, poor thing.",Christie
13692,"No, we must look elsewhere.",Christie
13693,"Mrs. Inglethorp didn’t have a candle, only a reading-lamp.”",Christie
13694,“Nothing to investigate.,Christie
13695,We found Mrs. Ackroyd in the hall.,Christie
13696,A childish rhyme of my infancy came back into my mind-the rhyme of the ten  little Indian boys.,Christie

13698,"Then:—  “Use your little gray cells,” he said.",Christie
13699,Dead?,Christie
13700,"From now on, it is our  task to suspect each and every one amongst us.",Christie
13701,"And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally, we put it here!”",Christie
13702,"Some little difficulty, it seemed, a husband who was worried about his  wife's health and wanted a report on it without her being alarmed.",Christie
13703,"“Not every kind of a fool,” murmured Poirot, tenderly nursing the injured member.",Christie
13704,"“My dear Evie, do be careful.",Christie
13705,"“It’s bad news, Flora,” he said quietly.",Christie
13706,"He thought it very important that Ralph should be found as soon as possible, and induced to come forward and give an account of himself.",Christie
13707,"He wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief, then stretched out a hand gingerly towards the hilt of the dagger.",Christie
13708,“But I still can’t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.”,Christie
13709,A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my mind.,Christie
13710,The colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated “one man of the world to another.”,Christie
13711,"I satisfied myself of that by a little experiment the other day—you remember, doctor?",Christie
13712,"“And I think that you are clever, and will find out the truth.",Christie
13713,“What does he think?,Christie
13714,"“I can’t say I remember noticing it—but, of course, it may have been there all the time.”",Christie
13715,Poirot’s face remained quite impassive.,Christie
13716,"He said, as he joined the other two:   ""He's crazy. . . .",Christie
13717,"I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either at six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs. Raikes’s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the village.",Christie
13718,"My imagination, sternly checked by the  exigencies of my profession, waxed secretly to colossal force.",Christie

13723,Then  all three stopped dead.,Christie
13724,"“East Wind passes,” said Caroline.",Christie
13725,I exclaimed.,Christie
13726,Some one creeping about stealthily in the night  He listened-but the sound was not repeated.,Christie
13727,“It is true.,Christie
13728,"I fancy that forty pounds went to him—the numbers of the notes didn’t correspond, but of course he’d have changed them first thing.",Christie
13729,"I took it for granted, you see.”",Christie
13730,But I could not look at it in Poirot’s philosophical way.,Christie
13731,"""What next?""",Christie
13732,Our way back to the village was punctuated by his complaints.,Christie
13733,"And, smiling to himself, he began to make plans, fantastic plans for the  future.",Christie
13734,Absolutely worthless.,Christie
13735,“Who took it to her room?”,Christie
13736,“Whom did she go out to meet?,Christie
13737,"I swear that the dose I gave  the woman was perfectly-""   ""Dr. Armstrong.""",Christie
13738,"“A clever idea, but not the truth.”",Christie
13739,“I was so cruel to him that night—so hard and bitter.,Christie
13740,"By the way, whose is the smaller desk in the corner?”",Christie
13741,"Last night, when I was clearing up, there wasn't but  nine, sir.",Christie
13742,"“Yes, my friend.",Christie
13743,The letter disappeared.,Christie

13746,“I do say so.,Christie
13747,And you never told me?,Christie
13748,“It is useless to deny.,Christie
13749,"True enough, there he was, tearing down the street, hatless, and gesticulating as he went.",Christie
13750,I did not reply.,Christie
13751,Men don't commit  suicide that way-and what's more Blore wasn't that kind of man.,Christie
13752,"“I thought, perhaps, that by making him believe you knew, you might force him out into the open—not necessarily by confession.",Christie
13753,"The residue—including this property, and the shares in Ackroyd and Son—to his adopted son, Ralph Paton.”",Christie
13754,Mr. Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook.,Christie
13755,"He had stood aside, and as I went out I had seen the look in Mary’s eyes, as John Cavendish had caught his wife in his arms.",Christie
13756,"I accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be so positive about the matter.",Christie
13757,He was so seldom vehement about anything.,Christie
13758,"And, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.”",Christie
13759,"“The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.”",Christie
13760,“Yes.,Christie
13761,"Nobody's got a revolver, by any chance?",Christie
13762,Philip Lombard made a cheery  remark.,Christie
13763,Mr.  Owen!,Christie
13764,“Ralph?” he said vaguely.,Christie
13765,Blore snorted.,Christie
13766,Major Ellerby was partly responsible.,Christie
13767,"On arrival at The Larches, we were informed that Parker was already there awaiting our return.",Christie
13768,"Poirot might have excellent reasons for his belief in Inglethorp’s innocence, but a man of the type of Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot could supply.",Christie
13769,"“My dear Caroline,” I said, “what for?”",Christie
13770,“Of what?”,Christie
13771,Suddenly he sighed and shook his head.,Christie
13772,"“_Mais, oui!_”  “You remember”—he addressed us collectively again—“that through all the tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept.",Christie
13773,It's our murderer's touch of local colour!,Christie
13774,"Lombard said to Rogers:   ""Get some brandy.""",Christie
13775,"“A letter in the murderer’s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a little clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp, warned in time, would have escaped.",Christie
13776,Armstrong coughed.,Christie
13777,"Personally, I was not sanguine.",Christie
13778,"Lombard said:   ""What about yourself, Mr. Blore?""",Christie
13779,Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.,Christie
13780,"Blore said:   ""And that gets us-where?""",Christie
13781,She scorned to label herself a “lady parlormaid.”,Christie
13782,"He waited a minute, then went on to Philip Lombard's room.",Christie
13783,Ralph Paton may have been the man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars.,Christie
13784,"Blore said:   ""He was a crook.",Christie
13785,I thought for a minute or two.,Christie
13786,"I waited a minute, and then he went on.",Christie
13787,"I have already over a thousand pounds saved—the result of my connection with—er—my late master, Major Ellerby.",Christie
13788,"“They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.”",Christie
13789,"Do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?”",Christie
13790,“Ah!” the Coroner leant back satisfied.,Christie
13791,He was absolutely astonished.,Christie
13792,The gang had got me squared and between us we got him put away  for a stretch.,Christie
13793,Poirot got up and came to her.,Christie
13794,Shall we oblige Inspector Davis with a set of our fingerprints also?”,Christie
13795,"Then, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called.",Christie
13796,It struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our conference was a medical one.,Christie
13797,"She said quickly:   ""Yes, everything, I think.""",Christie
13798,Miss Russell rose.,Christie
13799,He added that there were many cases of a similar nature going on all  the time-cases of deliberate murder-and all quite untouchable by the law.,Christie
13800,The boat grated against the rocks.,Christie
13801,"It was very late when I got back, and I hoped that Caroline would have gone to bed.",Christie
13802,“Is there anything else that I can tell you?” inquired Mr. Hammond.,Christie
13803,"Jumping out, I pulled the bell impatiently.",Christie
13804,He is coming here.”,Christie
13805,"Isaac Morris.""",Christie
13806,"See now, I did not invite Inspector Raglan to be present.",Christie
13807,"Mr. Blore said soothingly, ""That's right.",Christie
13808,“What is it?,Christie
13809,He'd avoided people after that-withdrawn into himself.,Christie
13810,I don’t mind answering them.,Christie
13811,"It may be understood-I think a psychologist would  understandthat with my mental makeup being what it was, I adopted the law  as a profession.",Christie
13812,"He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.",Christie
13813,“Were you in company with anyone?”,Christie
13814,"Philip Lombard said:   ""What's the time now?""",Christie
13815,"""Headed Ritz Hotel and typewritten.""",Christie

13821,"Wanting things, scheming for them, lying, cheating, running up bills, promising to pay—oh!",Christie
13822,“I’ll Pung that Green Dragon.,Christie
13823,"He looked from Wargrave to Vera  and repeated helplessly-weakly:   ""I tell you some one must have taken it.""",Christie
13824,The remorseless small voice went on.,Christie
13825,“What have they said to you to-day?”,Christie
13826,IT WAS so sudden and so unexpected that it took every one's breath away.,Christie
13827,“You and John are not going to live here?”,Christie
13828,I was not long in doubt.,Christie
13829,“They’re in my bag in the hall.,Christie
13830,"Crazy, nothing less.",Christie
13831,We couldn't get the doctor to her.,Christie
13832,She and Philip Lombard sat on the window-sill of the living-room.,Christie
13833,“That’s what I said.,Christie
13834,"For that revolver was  found up in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs-  Wargrave's room.""",Christie
13835,I looked at him ruefully.,Christie
13836,No one hiding-no  possible hiding-place.,Christie
13837,“On the top of—of—a wardrobe.”,Christie
13838,"A man who is capable of shutting up Caroline and sending her, like the Queen of Sheba, empty away must be something of a personality.",Christie

13840,I myself am perhaps an instance.,Christie
13841,"""Not if you knew Morris!",Christie

13843,"“Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don’t know how you came to hear of it.",Christie
13844,I must be going mad.,Christie
13845,For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene I had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been what he called “playing the comedy” with a view to making himself interesting and important.,Christie
13846,I could take it or leave it-  those were his words.,Christie
13847,“Dr. Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?”,Christie
13848,I had to go and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire.”,Christie
13849,“But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs. Inglethorp herself?”,Christie

13851,Heart seizure!,Christie
13852,“Was Dr. Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening?,Christie

13855,“No.”,Christie
13856,Stupendous!,Christie
13857,“But why?”,Christie
13858,Mr. Davis was quite fluent on the subject.,Christie
13859,"Legge said heavily:   ""That death of Morris'is a damned sight too opportune!""",Christie
13860,"I was not quite pleased with that deduction, but I let it stand for the minute.",Christie
13861,I asked coldly.,Christie
13862,"A little cry broke from her lips:  “You don’t know, you don’t know, how this hateful place has been prison to me!”",Christie
13863,“How did you know?”,Christie
13864,"He sometimes affects the pose of the bluff male, intent on the game and indifferent to gossip.",Christie
13865,"""It's Armstrong ...",Christie
13866,"That’s where the Yard’s at a disadvantage in a case of this kind, where the murder’s only out, so to speak, after the inquest.",Christie
13867,"The judge said sharply:   ""It was in his glass?""",Christie
13868,He pointed a dramatic forefinger.,Christie
13869,"The Assistant Commi sioner said:   141 agee.""",Christie
13870,Her expression changed a little.,Christie
13871,"“We’ve been engaged for about a month,” continued Flora in her cool voice, “but it was only announced yesterday.",Christie
13872,"She added quickly, conscientiously  determined to make her position clear at once, ""I haven't even seen my  employer yet.""",Christie
13873,"As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled.",Christie
13874,"The whole place is in a bustle, and the chances of one particular person being noticed telephoning or getting into the express are very small indeed.",Christie
13875,“But I must ask you to trust me.,Christie
13876,Brute of a man—he terrified Flora into saying she took that money from poor Roger’s room.,Christie
13877,"“Mr. Ackroyd had perfect faith in the honesty of all the servants,” he said hotly.",Christie
13878,"Vera shivered a little and said:   ""There is a storm coming.""",Christie
