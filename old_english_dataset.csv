1545,"Sense the puttyng of our shipp's in order ageynst march, it was ment to have sent this next month ten shipp's of warr, wherof five of hir majesty's and five marchantes, to have lyne uppon the cost of spayn, to have impeached the coming togither from sondry port's of ther victells and shippyng, and also to have discovered the truth of the report's of the gret preparations of a spanish navy and army, accompted for iij=c= sayle of shipp's and gally's and nere to iij=xx= thousand men, by mean's of the helps out of itally, from the pope, the duke of florence, duke of savoye, from napl's and sicilly; but, lately, advertisement is come out of itally, that ther is no such preparation made there, nether of men nor shippes, but whyther we be duly advertised i am yet in dout.",m

1547,"Now, my lord, i will resort to a special matter, whereof hir majesty has sent me chardg to wryte sense i began this letter.",m
1548,"A gentleman of the duk of bullyon, whom your lordship know, named de sevilly, cam two day's past to hir majesty from the duk, to inform hir of a gret preparation of grayn and other victell provyded in louvayn and champayny, for to be sent down by the ryver of maze to the lowe countreys, for the prinse of parma's army, which mass of victell is to come by the duk's castell of sedan, under his bridg; and though he have good will to stay it, yet he dar not so doo, for feare of offense to be intended ageynst hym, but if he cold devize how to by it of the owners, with collor to serve both for his own provisions to store his own castells and houses, and to distribut amongst his neighbours that do want, he sayth he wold aventur the staye with that collor, and though the vallew may be, as it is thought, above j=c= thousand crowns, yet his desyre is to borrow but forty, or thirty, or, i thynk, twenty thousand crowns, toward's that purpos.",m
1549,"And herin hir majesty has gret lykyng to have this stayd, as a matter of very gret moment, as your lordship has gret cause so to thynk by the want of victells presently in flaunders and br , but hir majesty, fyndyng hir charg's otherwize so great, she do not yeld to this loone, but has thought of some other meanes, as hereafter followe.",m
1550,"First, she wold have your lordship to impart this matter, as you will thynk mete, to the stat's ther, in secret sort, for which purpos the gentillman sevilly offre to come to your lordship, as he sayth he also ment to have doone, as sent from the duk his master, and hir majesty thynke this intention to stay this provision of such a moment to weaken the adversary's forces, as, in very truth, a power of men ageynst them hyred with j=c= thowsand crowns cold not so much annoy the adversaryes, and, if the stat's might yeld to the loone of the some of xxx thousand crowns to this purpooss, hir majesty wold thynk very well of them, the consideration wherof hir majesty has willed me, in hir name, to be left to your lordship.",m
1551,"And besyde this meane, as if it shold not take place, hir majesty has also commanded me to instruct our ambassador in franse to understand the duke of bullions mynd, whyther he will not lyk that the french kyng be moved from hir majesty, very ernestly, ether to impeach this great convoye, consideryng the great derth of victells in france, or consideryng how hir majesty has bene hertofore animated to inter into this action, to save the low countreys from the conquest of the spanyardes, and to impeach the king of spayns gretnes; and, therfor, to move hym, in honor, to prohibitt the frequent convoy of victells out of france, or els that he will not mislyk if the duke of bullion can stey this convoye.",m
1552,"And in these two sortes, hir majesty has thought to devize mean's to stay this convoy, but whyther the same will be stayd i do dout, and yet, truly, i know not how the adversary might receave a greter blow, without drawyng of any weapon.",m
1553,"Wher your lordship has had gret desyre to have had man william pellham, and also my lord graye, your lordship will understand that i have done my uttermost for mr.

1567,"mr. secretarie, i know yow think long to hear of some certein proceeding here, which, for my parte, i doe as greatly hasten, assuring yow, that, sinse i came to the hage, i have not ceassed calling upon the stat's for their resolution, which they will in no wize make other then that i must be absolute governour, both of warre and peace, over all their provinc's.",m
1568,"As upon new yeers day in the morning they came all to me, and brought with them a heralt and trumpettes, meaning as soone as they had delyvered their speech, which d.",m
1569,"Leoninus had to make for them, which was to offer to me, with many good woord's for her majesti's sake, the absolute governement of the whole provinces, and to proclaime the same immediatly.",m
1570,"I was skarce readie, when one brought me woord of their being all in my great chamber, desyring to speake with me.",m
1571,"Not knowing or thinking it had ben for any such matter, i made haste to goe to them, and so did, having the best of my company there with me.",m
1572,"As soone as i came to them, by and by leoninus began an oration to me, and, even as he began, one told me in mine eare, that they were come to offer this matter, and had brought heralt and all, &c.",m
1573,"I was so bold presently to interrupt the chauncelour, telling him, that i heard he had some matter rather to deale more privately in, than so openly, and therfore prayed him and the rest, to come in with me to my chamber, where they should have a more convenient place.",m
1574,"He turned abowt and said, ""yow hear my lord desyers us to withdraw with him into his chamber,"" and so they all went with me into my bedchamber, and i called such of the best of my company as i thought meetest for v or vj, wherof mr. Davison and mr. Dr. Clerk were ij.",m
1575,"And there the chauncelour began again, and proceeded with his matter, which was, indeed, after a long discourse of her majesti's goodnes, of the love of the country to her, of the trust they had in her above all the world, of the necessity they had for safety of their state and countreys, albeit her majesty would not take the soveraignty upon her, which they yet desyred might be, to choose some person of honour and creditt to be their governour.",m
1576,"And as there was no prinse in the world whom they ought obediense and duety onto, but to her majestie, so seing the creditt and trust it pleased her to putt me in here alredie, and the favour, creditt, and i cannot tell what, so many good woord's they used of me, they tooke knowledge of that i had long had at her majesti's handes, with many yeers contynuaunse in her service, as appeered, they said, both now by her own commendation by lettres, as also to their commissioners in ingland, that had reported the same of her own mouthe: they did not know any person whom they could desyre so much to take this office in hand as my self, and, therfore, with one whole consent they did there beseech me, even for the love her majesty bare them, and for the help of so afflicted a countrey, that was ever a faithfull frend to the crowne of ingland, that i would take the place and name of absolute governour, and general of all their forc's and souldiers, with their whole revenues, taxes, composicions, and all manner of benefitt's that they have, or may have, to be putt freely and absolutely into my handes, disposicion and order, with so ample woords and term's as here were too long to recite, seing i will shortly send you the whole by mr. Davison.",m
1577,"As soone as he had inded i aunswered by mr. Davison, whom i required to delyver it in french, as they all speak only french, that, as this was a matter unlooked for, being further then had past in the contract with her most excellent majesty heretofore, so was i presently very farre unprovided to give them aunswer to this matter, albeit, in her majesti's behaulf, greatly to thank them for their ernest goodwills and great affeccion borne to her majestie; and very true it was they did all acknowledge, that her highn's had shewed herself a most loving princesse and neighbour to them, as did well appeer to their embassadors in ingland, that what she did was only for the good will she bare to this afflicted countrey, and for no private respect or commodity to her self.",m
1578,"I did also give them most harty thank's for myself, that did conceive so well of me, being but a straunger to them, that they would hazard so great a matter upon me, as all their state, both well and ill dooing, should depend therupon.",m
1579,"But as her majesti's gracious favour toward's me ledd them to this conceite of my abilitie, farre more then was in me to deale in any such cause, so i prayed them not to take it in ill parte, that i desyred at their handes, to proceed with them in tho's caws's which i had to doe in her majesti's behaulf with them, and give me time, or els some of them to come onto me, to hear what i had to delyver onto them touching the contract alredy past betwixt her majesty and them, wherin i thought they should finde i had more alredy layed upon me, than so weake shoulders were able to bear, and well to goe thorow withal.",m
1580,"That her majesty had sent me only to serve them, and so i promised i would, both faithfully and honestly, even as her majesty had commaunded and willed me to doe.",m
1581,"So they returned, after mr. Davison had made this aunswer for me, not leaving, at their departure, to insist upon their former request very ernestly.",m
1582,"The next morning they appointed v or vj to come to me, which were of the chief of them, and, leaving the former matter, as not to speak of it at all, i delt with them upon certain point's and questions, such as her majesty had willed me principally to remember; as, first, to know what their forc's were, who were their chief governours, and had charge of town's and fortes, what mean's they had to contynue and mainteyne their forces, how their people and garrisons were paied, what debt's they were in to their souldiers.",m
1583,"Theis, and sundry other, which are sett downe for her majestie, you all will receive: leying before them what a mighty inemy they had against them, it behooved them to shew good force and good means to withstand such an inemy.",m
1584,"To theis thinges, and all other questions, i think their wilbe good satisfaction given to her majestie, to cawse her think their state not so hard as has ben doubted, nor for her majesty to repent her cost or charge adventured for them.",m
1585,"I doe assure myself it will proove the best expenc's that ever shee bestowed in her life, and the best repayed againe to her coffers, if god overthrow not the world.",m
1586,"I did never see greater probability in my life of assured good successe, and protest onto you, i like the matter xx tym's better then i did in ingland, and so i beleeve any man here of judgement do the like.",m
1587,"And yet is it nowe at the very woorst, as well for the decay of our men, as for the season of this time, which is such as we cannot, till the wether break, send by water or land almost to any place.",m
1588,"I could not hear owt of zeland but by long seas, all the ryvers be ycy and frozen, but not to bear any horse or cariage.",m
1589,"Th'enemy has attempted sundry places, but repulsed at all, and i dare presume thus much for her majesti's name only, that if her comfort had not come, yow had heard of many a revolt er this daie, and the poor garrison-men, the straungers chiefly, suffer presently the greatest misery in the world for all thinges, and yet send good comfort daily here to me, that for the queen of ingland's sake they will suffer more yet.",m
1590,"The queen of ingland they would serve as their mistris, and under me as her minister here, with a better will then ever they served under the prinse of orange; yet they loved him well, but they never hoped of the liberty of this countrey till now.",m
1591,"It is assured me the stat's are very well able to perfourme their charge, and with great ease.",m
1592,"The count hollock  surely a wise, gallant gentleman, and a right souldier, and very well esteemed with many of the capteins and souldiers; he has only one fault, which is, drinking, but good hope that he will amend it.",m
1593,"Some make me believe i shalbe able to doe much with him, and i meane to doe my best, for i see no man that know's all theis countreys, and the people of all sortes, like him, and this fault overthrow's all.",m
1594,"Here is another little fellow, as litle as may be, but one of the gravest and wisest young men that ever i spake withall; it is the count guilialme of nassau, he govern's frizeland; i would every provinse had such another.",m
1595,"He had noe lettre from her majesty yet, nor his father, but that mak's not so great matter as for this young gentleman.",m
1596,"Her majesty may doe well also to contynue some kinden's from time to tyme with this howse of nassau, especially to shew to take care for the count maurice, who has ben greatly laboured to have harkened to a composition, i can tell you all, and i see him much discontented with the stat's for certein.",m
1597,"He has a sullen, deep witt, and sharp counsellours of his fathers abowt him, now that they see the hope of holland and zeland taken awaie, which was the marke was wholy by the father shotte at, and almost hitt, as i am sure you have heard.",m
1598,"The young gentleman is yet to be wonne only to her majestie, i perceive, of his owne inclination.",m
1599,"The howse is merveilous poor, and litle regarded by the stat's hitherto, and if they gett any thing it is like to be by her majestie, which i wishe should be altogether, and she may easily doe for him to wynne him sure; i will undertake it.",m
1600,"Well, now i will returne a litle backe again, to tell you all what followed sinse my former conferense with the stat's.",m
1601,"They went to their fellow's and told them what had passed; they aunswered me again, and brought me an act sett downe in writing by them all, that i should be pryvy to all their state, as well for their forc's as their means, and that i should see very flatly that they abused not her majestie, neither with the offer of sovereigntie, nor yet with the state of their ability to mainteine their cawse, but better then ever they told her of, and referred to me what i thought of the strength and force of theis countreys.",m
1602,"""well, now we will say, and make your lordship know,"" say they, ""the people bearing the love wee see they doe to her majestie, if she had taken the sovereignty over us, she should have had monethly 300,000 florens, certeinly payed to her purse, which is 30,000=li= sterling, every month, beside the custom's of merchauntes, and flaunders if it might be recovered, which did yeeld as much and more alone; and her majesty should doe more good, and defend th'enemy farr easilyer, with 100,000 than we will with 200,000, for the obediense and reverense to her majesty would be as great as in ingland, and that we doe is even with feare and force among them, which bringe such confusion as there is no remedie, but either your lordship must take the whole governement upon you, at our humble suite, and at the request of all the rest, or els all wilbe yet lost;"" confessing that confusion of officers has undoon their governement, and not to be recovered but by som one to take it that is so backt as i should be by the countenaunse of her majestie, whom the people only trust and love, for onto no other will they committ that which they will to her majestie, or one of hirs; and so doe they flatly conclude the matter upon me.",m
1603,"All the lords here have ben in like sort with me, and all the captens, and governors, and magistrat's of townes, pressing me most earnestly, if i love her majestie, if i love the good of ingland, and theis countryes, to take it, and that forthwith, bycawse the souldiers be unpayed, and no man will contribute any longer but to her majesti's minister, and to him all plac's doe promis, and have sent their procuratours, as they told me alredy, to bind themselv's and all their town's for the payment of ij=c= m. florens monethly, beside the admiralty to be discharged by their customes, as it is alredy.",m
1604,"They will also make their oath to me, and all officers, to returne presently to pay all somm's to me.",m
1605,"Thus it stande presently, as either all must be hazarded and lost, or els i must take it, which, as farre as i can see, and all here with me, as the case inforce it, must need's be best for her majesti's service every way.",m
1606,"The reasons mr. Davison will delyver you, who has seen how i have proceeded, and upon what necessity either this way must be taken, or els all overthrowne.",m
1607,"It is doon for the best, and if so her majesty accept of it, all wilbe to the best.",m
1608,"I have had none other scop herein, nor will have, but her majesti's service above all worldly respectes, and well knowne to the wisest here with me, how desperatly both the lords and capteins were and are bent, if i should not take this upon me, to have left and given over the whole service of theis states, which had made an easy conquest for th'enemie, but a most dangerous for her majesty.",m
1609,"Thus referring the full declaration of our doing's here to mr. Davison, who will shortly be with you, doe take my leave, and commytt you to the lords protectyon.",m

1639,"Our money goe very low, and i beleive you all will not be best pleased with the former expences, and yet am i forst to dysburs much of this money for relyfe of the souldyers not payd, and, as i wrote of late to you all, so doe i now also to my lord tresorer by mr.

1728,remembranc's for mr. Davison.,m
1729,"First, how all the stat's here in every place, from my first aryvall, receaved me as well for there general and governour as for hir majesties, pressing me very ernestly at my coming to the hage, to take uppon me the same absolute goverment of all these provinc's unyted; nevertheless i deferred yt by as many mean's as i could, tyll i was fully informyd by the knoledge and mean's which mr. Davison had gotten of ther estate and abyllytye, whereby beinge fully satysfied, hit was thought best service for hir majestye any way to accept ther ernest offer.",m
1730,The caus's which moved me to accept this place werr these.,m
1731,"By hir majesti's apointement, i was hir general of all hir forc's in these countreys, and by a contract, lykewyse general of their armye, and ther first counsellor.",m
1732,"The confusion that was amonge the states-general bredd many dysorders almost uncurable amonge them, as the discontentation of the captens, governors and soldyers, in all plac's becom desperatt for lack of pay, the yll imploying of ther treasure, whereby all matters most necessary for the warrs and defense of the countrey was utterly neglectyd, the unyversal hate and myslyke which both these and all the people had conceaved ageinst them, being such as, yf hir majesty had not sent when she dyd, ether they must have chosen some one governor, to have taken this charge in hande to remedy there confusions, or ell's have reconcyled themselv's to the inyme, for avoyding the further ruyn and hazard of themselv's.",m
1733,"And yf they had had any other governor then myself, hit ys most certen hir majesty could not have these countreys so fully at her commandment as now she ys lyke to have.",m
1734,"Nether might she convenyently have kept, ether an armye, or any nobleman here, to be hir generall, but must have byn at the directyon and dysposytion of that governor.",m
1735,"Besides, how the contract's and agrement's could be so well kept, ether for payment's or otherwyse, that ys betwene hir majesty and these countreys, ys as dowbtful, or rather owt of dowbt.",m
1736,"Beside yt had byn by that mean's also very dangerous that a peace might have byn procured and concluded with the inymye without hir majesti's consent or prevety, hir people and captens, and towns delyvered for hir seurty, in great danger to be all lost.",m
1737,"The inymye offeryng any revenge to any hir majesti's domynions she might be depryved also of such helps and succors as these countreys may well asist hir now withall, the governor being at hir majesty comandment, with all other servic's lykewyse, but, the governor being at hir majesti's dysposytyon and dyrectyon, these want's aforeseyd ar provyded for and suplyed; hir people ar to be in all sewrty and to be well treatyd; hir contract's and agrement's ar always to be well observyd and kept to hir majesti's most advantage.",m
1738,"He also, having the placyng and disposing of these garysons, the payment's and other condycyons toward hir majesty ar most lyke to be better kept.",m
1739,No treaty or peace to be made or delt in but by hir majesty.,m
1740,"No attempt can be made by the inymye ageinst hir majesti's domynyons, but she may dyspose and have all such succors as shalbe nedefull for hir.",m

1853,"But, admitt me to be even acccording as her majesty did contract with the estates, ys it not there agreed i should be the general of their warr's and armyes, as well as of her majesties? was i not there placed as chiefe counsailour of the estate amonge them, and two nominated also by her majesty to assist me? i suppose in this place it was not ment, neyther for me nor them, as counsailours for the warr's only, for then i am sure there should have bene named more famous captain's to assist me.",m

5453,"mr. Coosin, that which i writt of prae-elections is most certayne.",m

5455,"I am likewize fully perswaded that if the mean's should be used in tyme, this prae-election would take no effect, because the mr. and fellow's may be infors't to choose againe when a place shalbe voyd, and otherway's then they have prae-elected.",m
5456,"But i hold not so fitt that you should proceed by the way of mandat, unlesse it may be gott very easily.",m
5457,"If it may be so, it were not amisse that you were senior fellowe, though but a short tyme, for other things that depend on it, as i have heretofore told you.",m
5458,"And certaynly this would bring them to a new election, and restrayne them to a new person.",m
5459,"Though the other course by the chancellor will prove the easier, and it may be likewize effectual.",m
5460,"For if you can gett your owne lord and my lord of rochester to assist the chancellor, you will make knowne the right of your succession, what wrong you have hitherto suffer'd in want of your admissions, and how farre this prae-election is against the statutes; and it may be in all of them you will have redresse.",m
5461,"Besides, you may gett there an order made for succession, such as may be reasonable and conscionable, which if you can doe, you will doe a perpetual good to the college by taking away differenci's in heereafter in elections, and by giving some liberty onto the poore junior fellowes, who, as they are now, are slav's to the vic's and defects of the seniors, and not only beare with all indignities, but, as you knowe, are fayne to be pertakers of unseemly cours's.",m
5462,"If you goe this way, you must suddainly gett out inhibition from the chancellor to the mr. and fellowes, that they make no election onto any place that is or shalbe voyd, until the right of succession and other greevanc's of franckland's foundation be heard and examin'd, and some day appoynted for the hereing of it by the chancellor himselfe at london, onto which they bring likewize these statutes, the donation of your places, and especially the annal's.",m
5463,"It must be heard at london in any case, not at cambridge, and you must be furnished for the right of your succession, and of the unlawfulln's of this prae-election.",m
5464,"I thinke one thing must needs fal out by it, that, either in this or in the next election, they will give your lord satisfaction in your selfe.",m
5465,"But, if mr. Husband give over before you, gett an inhibition: (which is much to be feared, especially if they heare at cambridge of any stirring against them) there is no possibility of overthrowing the new election which shalbe made when the place is voyd, and if it be so allready, or shalbe so, all you can doe is to do some good for the tyme to come, which if you can doe conveniently, and without much trouble, it wilbe woorth your labour; but you have no reason to undergoe either much charg's or much trouble.",m
5466,"Further then this i see not to be done, for as for your appeale, if you gett an inhibition, you will have no use of it; and if they make a new election when the place shalbe voyd, the appeale for the prae-election will not serve the turne, unlesse they make no new election, which if they should not doe, the former prae-election and admission will not be inough, and in that case it devolv's to the mr. after the first month, and, i thinke, after the second month onto the chancellor.",m
5467,"And this you may secretly inquire after, if there be allready, or when there shalbe an admission past, whether they made a new election, or no, (\per viam scrutinii\).",m
5468,"The parlament would certainly referre this cause to the visitors, if you should bring it there, and ten to one dr. Caius' visitors would come in, the provost of king's, and the mr. of bennet, and the senior phisition; therefore, if you doe stirre in it, goe to the chancellor, that you may stand something uppon even ground.",m

Burgoyne and myselfe at these last assizes, before judge yelverton, the same which judge whitlock, the yeere before, had rejected and cast out of the court, as knowing no law wheron they shold be grounded, and allowing what we did with much approbation in the church, charging the jury to admit of no such presentments, but if any doubts were about the manner of celebrating any church service, to referre the parti's that doubted to the bishop, according to the order in that behalf provided by the preface to our book of common prayer.",m

6723,"In the yeere 1640 my lord pembrook's father, being then lord chamberlaine, did, under pretense of the want of a fitt house neare the court, perswade my predecessour bishop morton, a timorous person, to give his consent to the bringing a bill into the parliament for the alienating durham house in the strand for ever from the see, and setling of it on the earle of pembrooke and heir's under the fee farme rent of 200=l=.",m
6724,"(\per annum\) ; alleaging that the house was rather a charge to the bishops of durham then a benefitt, and that the reserved rent would be a great advantage: whereas in truth it was the quite contrary, my predecessours having, besid's the accommodation of a house and stabl's for themselv's and their famili's when they were called up to give their attendanse at the court of parliament, used to make a considerable profit in letting part of the house in lease.",m
6725,"This bill being brought in found so great opposition in the parliament (notwithstanding the prevalency of the faction at that time in both hous's against the church) that it could not pass till a proviso was inserted that if the said yeerely rent or 200=l=., or any part thereof, should happen to  behind and unpaid by the space of six months after any of the term's at which it ought to be paid, that then and from thenceforth the said house should revert onto the bishops of durham, as if that act had never bin made: which clause i am perswaded was on purpose inserted by the lovers of the church, in hop's that in better tim's the see might recover its just rights, which at that time, the factions growing high, they could not preserve.",m
6726,"At the happy restoration of his majesty my lord pembrooke refused to pay the rent reserved by act of parliament till i was forced to bring declarations of ejectment against him, and then he beganne to thinke of taking up the business, and in regard it was at the beginning of the king's happy assuming of his just government and that the earle was a purchaser from the rebells, the satisfaction of whom was then under deliberation, i was perswaded to decline the forfeiture, and accept of the rent reserved, upon condition that for the future the rent should be punctually paid onto me, without any deduction for public tax's and assessments; and on this manner the business stood till michaelmass last, at which time there became halfe a yeere's rent due to me, which after some time that by the good providense of almighty god london's dreadfull sickness was in a great measure abated, and the inhabitants thereof, together with the king's court, were most of them returned to their houses, i sent one to demand at bainard's castle, the place at which my lord pembrook's owne servants desired to have it demanded, and then instead of receiving the rent, or having civill intreati's of forbearance, those that called for it could get nothing but downeright denyalls, my lord's servants saying that they had not received their rents for the houses, and till they received them they would not pay me my rents.",m
6727,"These denyals continuing for six months after michaelmass, i gave order to my attorney to make a legal demand of the rent and the (\nomine poenae's\) , and proceed to declarations of ejectment, according to the advantage the act of parliament gave me, judging i could do no less without prejudicing both my selfe and my successours, but my successours much more then my selfe, my advantage in likelyhood being to be but small, and of short continuanse.",m
6728,"And having now proceeded thus farre upon these just and equitable grounds, i am tould that my lord the earl of pembrooke is using indeavours to your grace to procure me to desert my advantage, or to get the king to lay his commands upon me to do it; but as i trust his majesty will not be perswaded to it, so i am confident your grace is so great an asserter of the rights of the church that you will no way hinder, but, in what you may, further this see, miserably impaired, first by the loss of norhamshire and elinshire, sinse by the loss of this house, and now lately by the loss of the court of wards.",m
6729,"Besides, i verily believe, if your grace please to consider the thing, you will be in the same mind with me, that the act of parliament has determined my lord of pembrook's title, and that, if i would, it is not in my power to release the forfeiture so to him but that my successours may recover it from him.",m
6730,"And as i can neither ought to do any thing in prejudice of my see and successours, so i hope neither the king, your grace, nor my lord chancellour, will require or desire it of me; for there are many reasons why i and my successours should have the benefit of this forfeiture, but not any that i can comprehend why it should be pardoned to him, it not coming upon him by any surprise, but by his owne and his servants' willfull neglect and obstinacy, who very well knew the penalty of the delay of paying their rents, and i cannot see any reason why this default should be passed over in silence, or why the title given by the act of parliament to the bishop and his successours in this see should bee neglected or waved, but that the same reasons may at any time hereafter be brought why the like default should also be remitted, and so his lordship may at any time delay the payment of the rent to me or my successours as long as he pleaseth, without any hazard or loss to himselfe.",m
6731,"And i am sure it cannot be alleaged on his behalfe that he has disbursed any thing in the improvement of it, but has by that gained very large profit, for besid's vast summs of money raised by the sale of the lead, stones, timber, &c., he has without the expense of one penny in the buildings reserved to himselfe a considerable annual rent above the 200=l=. payable by the act of parliament to the see of durham.",m
6732,"And while he pleased to keep it as a dwelling house, for which purpose alone his father pretended to take it, that he might be ready to give his attendanse at court, he had a farre better pallace then yorke house at a less rent then my lord the duke of buckingham was pleased to set out therefore in lands, for which, besid's the rent, the archbishops of yorke receive fin's as the tenants come in and renew their leas's.",m
6733,"Whereby it will clearely appeare that his lordship will be no looser but a gainer by the house, though it do revert to the see now.",m
6734,"Whereas if  will not revert, i and my successours must of necessity be great loosers, as i have already beene, by its passing from us, a much greater summe then the rent reserved not being sufficient to provide a house and stabl's fitt to receive our famili's when any occasion is given us to come up to london, if our stay there be of any continuanse.",m

6814,"I remember, when i was prebend there, a great stir and question was made by the organist of the church about halfe bishop langley's song schoole stipend, and that one rangall, a singing man in the quire, had a contention with him in the chancery about it, before judge hutton, as i was then told.",m
6815,"If there be any such matter you may find it in the examiner's office, or some other office there.",m
6816,"And if my memory be good, i thinke you told me that the coroner or collector of my rents at durham accounted to my auditor 15=d=., or such a matter, for the ground whereupon the ruin'd hous's or school's upon the place greene stood, besid's a free rent paid for the archdeacon's house next adjoining, and some others.",m
6817,"Let me know what rents these are, and for what plac's.",m
6818,"For the deane was positive that the archdeacon's house upon the place greene paid a yearly rent to their receivor, and that therefore they have an interest in the palace greene, as well as the bishop, saying further that hee never knew any other grammar schoole kept in durham but by their schoolemaster alone, who was only able to teach the boys latine and greeke, according to the words, as hee said, (but hee was mistaken in it, as i said) of that which wee cal bishop langley's foundation and ordinanse.",m
6819,"If you can recover the schoolmasters' nam's that were in king edward the 6=th='s time, or at the beginning of queen mary and queen elizabeth, out of the old treasurers' books belonging to that time, wee may have some further lyght by them, and either mr. Bullock, or mr. Hedley, or robert king, can direct you to get the sight of them, if any such be still extant and remaining sinse the last rapine of the plunderers; from which god deliver us all hereafter.",m
6820,"Concerning the schooles, besid's what i said before, i added, that it would be a very hard thing for the deane and chapter to indeavour to take away mr. Nicholl's stipend, who was a diligent painfull man, and one of their own body, collated by me to it, and taking pain's in his place; all which was in effect to rob peter and pay paul, thereby to save so much money out of their own purs's.",m
6821,"And that it would be as hard if the bishop should be defeated of his own right (which in all things hee is sworne to preserve) in bestowing that place by collation, which i'm sure the deane's schoolmaster has not, and without which i know not how the auditor would pay any man the stipend.",m
6822,I pray search my register's office for any of my predecessors' grants of those plac's belonging to bishop langley's school's.,m
6823,"Bishop morton bestowed one of the plac's upon samuel martin, and, as i thinke, under his instrument and seale.",m
6824,"See what this is, and let me know what else you can find about it, either in my registry, or in my books of patents.",m
6825,"If nothing will do, it must go to law.",m
6826,"After all this, against mr. Deane's allegation that the halfe stipend has been alwai's paid to his schoole master (which is yet uncertaine) i have this argument, which they cal (\argumentum ad hominem\) , to urge, that if (\de facto\) it has beene so paid for (\dato et non concesso\) , yet (\de jure\) it ought not to have been paid, as mr. Deane himselfe and the prebendari's said in another case concerning themselv's.",m
6827,"For when their subsidi's due to the king were not long sinse demanded of them by my sub-collectors, who urged this argument that subsidi's had beene alwai's paid by the deane and chapter's predecessors, their answer was, that they regarded not what had been so paid and done (\de facto\) , but what ought to have beene done (\de jure\) ; and that no law could urge them to pay any subsidies, which though i grant not nor beleeve, yet they of all others should not urge an argument of custome in one case when they deny it in another.",m
6828,"But that this stipend was ever paid to their schoolemaster without the bishop's license and grant they can never proove, which i am the rather induced to believe that some such grant was made to them, or to some of them, because they say that mr. Smart, mr. Inglethorp, mr. Walton, mr. Smelt, had that house wherein mr. Martin now dwells, either to inhabit there or to take the rent of it by letting it out yearly, which they would no wai's do unl's the bishop had collated it upon them, and because bishop langley's foundation requir's both the schoole-masters there to reside personally in those houses, and to take an oath for that purpose, (^as vicars use to do, to reside upon their vicaridges^).",m

6870,"I am fully perswaded that the north and south bailys are no part nor parcell of the city of durham, and my reasons are these following: - 1=st=.",m
6871,"The scituation of the castle, which stands at the head of the city, and by it, and a wal adjoyning to it strik's quite through from one side of the city wal to an other, in such a manner that if you could continue the city any further then the castle gates, to make the communication further you must pass through the castle gates; for, in truth, those gat's which we commonly cal the gaole gat's are the castle gates, the gaole being part of the castle, to the mind, the outwardmost part, and the office of gaolor is, and alway's has bin, by the most antient patents upon record, stiled (\officium janitoris castri nostri exterioris\) , and it is not probable that a castle being built for a place of defense for the preservation of st.",m
6872,"Cuthbert's shrine: for by ancient histori's it appear's that was the intention of building it at first, conteining such a compass of ground as would conteine a competent number of households for the defense of the castle, which hold by castle gard to come in time of danger to defend the castle, as by ancient records do appeare, should suffer such a communication as would much weaken the defense of it, as it must needs do if the city extended through the castle, for then it would be necessary for the government of the city that the chiefe governor thereof should at all tim's have liberty as well in one part of the city as in an other; and indeed i thinke if one part of the citizens were tyed to the defense of the castle all the rest should be so too, which it is cleare they're not.",m
6873,2=dly=.,m
6874,The distinct jurisdiction.,m
6875,"The city of durham being a mannor, and having view of frank pledge within one circuit of ground, and the castle being an other mannor, and having view of frank pledge in an other circuit, and, i believe, it was never heard that one and the same city should have two distinct jurisdictions, which, in truth, is a contradiction (\in adjecto\) ; for a city impli's a body politick, but two distinct jurisdictions by her several chiefe governors (as the constable of the castle, and the chiefe magistrate of the city, whether he be called mayor, alderman, or bailiff, or by any other title whatsoever) would imply, if not two body politicks, yet surely one, and somewhat more, and would make a moral monster.",m
6876,"And this reason is confirmed to me by the constant practice and the words of the charter, which do comprehend the whole city to be within the corporation; but in practice the chiefe magistrate has never exercised any jurisdiction within the two bailiffs, more then they have in the elvets and crossgate; and therefore i conclude the first to be no more parcell of the city then the latter.",m

7174,"I did the more willingly reade it, becaus he is generally branded with ambistion, which caused him to doo what he did, and that the papis doo so generally obrade us that we cannot tell wheare our religion was before luther; and some haue taxt him of an imteperat life.",f
7175,"Theas resons made me desire to reade his life, to see vpon what growned theas opinions weare biult; and finding such satisfaction to meself, how fallsly theas weare raised, i put it into inglisch, and heare in closed haue sent it you; it is not all his life, for i put no more into inglisch then was not in the booke of marters.",f
7176,"Theas things of note i finde in it, firstly, what luther acknowledgs, he was instructed in the truth by an old man, whoo led him to the doctrine of justification by faith in christ: and erasmas, when his opinion was asked of luther, said he was in the right.",f
7177,"It is true the truth was much obscured with error; and then it pleased the lord to rais up luther as a trumpet to proclame his truth, and as a standered barare to hoold out the insinge of his truth; which did but make thos to apeare of the lords side, whoo weare so before.",f
7178,"And it is aparent to me, that no ambistious inds moued luther; for in all the cours of his life he neuer sheawed ambistion: tho he loued lerneing, yet, as fare as i can obsarue, he neuer affected to be estemed more lerned than he was.",f
7179,"So that in luther we see our owne fasess; they that stand for the old truee way they bring vp nwe doctriner, and it is ambistion, vnder the vaile of religion.",f
7180,"Another obseruation i finde in luther, that all his fasting and striknes, in the way of popery, neuer gaue him peace of concience; for he had greate fear's tell he had throughly learned the doctrine of justification by christ alone; and so it will be with vs all; no peace will we haue in our owne righteousness.",f
7181,"And one thinge more i must tell you all, that i am not of theaire minde whoo thinke, if he had bine of a milder temper it had bine better; and so erasmas says; but i thinke no other spirit could haue sarued his turne.",f

8977,"I will say noe more of the first sort, save onely that these things are shadow's and christ is the body, the kingdom of god consiste not of these thing's but in righteousnesse, the righteousness of god which is spirituall, and the original the righteousness of god which is the morall, and the coppy or image of the other, grace, joy in the holy ghost, he y=t= do these things will be accepted of god and approved of men, that is, will be justifyed in the day of all divine and humane principles, whether he eate or eate not, soe it be to the lord, to charity and dedification, but if any man be contentious about these things, i finde noe such custome nor any incouragem=t= to it, to flowe from the spirit and face of our lord jesus in my soule.",m
8978,"But if any man would bringe the s'=ts= into bondage to such ordinanc's as p'ish in the useing, hee seem's not to be thoroughly instructed in the power of christ's death or the virtue of his resurrection, by which a living way is made into the most holy place, thorow the rending of the vaile of fflesh ffor the other sort of principl's they have had their ffirst beginnings in christianity at symon magus who called himselfe the supreame vertue and power, that is the father and carryed about with him a trumpett which he said was the supreame wisdom or understanding on which the angells were begotten, according to these principl's by majicke he served himselfe of the rulers of the darkness of this world, and by sensuallity fed himselfe without feare, upon all visible instrum=ts= of voluptuousness.",m
8979,"S=r= the bottome of those principl's unvailed of all their maskeing, mysterious language, is this, that there is noe god but the spirit of this visible world, noe other state or appearanse of things besid's this visible image, noe other eternity save a perpetual succession of generation and corruption, noe angells besid's the various imaginations of men or man himselfe, that all this is god, the spirit of this world as it is in the whole world is the father.",m
8980,"Tho it is in every or any p'ticular man or appearanse is jesus christ; that this is the everlasting gospell to knowe this, that all is god, that wee are god, that everything is god, and upon this account to be alike free to all thinges, and this is heaven and spiritually on the other side to thinke that anythinge is sin, that there is a heaven, a hell, a god beyond this image of thinges, this alone is darkenesse, and hell and the devill, that when wee dye o=r= spirits are swallowed up into the spiritt of this world, which is our returne to the ffather and our body's change into some other natural forme of plant, beaste or the like.",m
8981,"But s=r= that which i have seene or learned in the light of christ is this, that there is one god the father of whome are all thinges, who alsoe is three, the ffather, the word and spiritt.",m
8982,"This is he who inhabite eternity, who is invisable, incomprehensible to the eye and understanding of every creature, whom the heavens of hevons cannot hold, those heavens which are farr more above these visible heavens, of sunn moon and starrs, than these are above this spott of earth, that there is one jesus the immortal word, by in and for whom all things were created invisible and visible; this jesus is god and soe equal to the ffather, one with the ffather he descended into fflesh, soe he became lesse then the ffather, and was obedient to him through the crosse, resurrection, and assention, he putt of fflesh returned to the ffather in our nature, which he changed ffrom fflesh into spiritt, conformeing it p'fectly to the divine nature makeing it in soule and body one spiritt with god the ffather, and yet keeping it in its owne propriety as a distinct spiritt from him.",m
8983,"This same jesus as the lord from heaven, as a quickening spirit descends into the soul's of his saints, reveal's himselfe and the ffather there form's himselfe in them, conform's them to himself, purge them by degre's from all polutions of flesh and spirit, carry's on the felloweship of his sufferings death and resurrection in them, until he have made them spiritt of his spiritt, one spirit with himselfe and y=e= ffather, first in soule, finally at the last day in body alsoe.",m
8984,"Thus his prayer is heard that his saints may be where he is and may be made p'fect in one, as the ffather and he are one.",m
8985,"In the meane tyme while wee are in fflesh wee are imperfect and weake in spirit, wee are besett with a weight of sin which easily presse us downe, and haveinge the first fruits of the spiritt wee still grone under this body of sin and death, though of a truth wee bye the eye of faith see ourselv's already p'fect in the ffather and in christ above, as alsoe the ffather and christ liveing in us, yet this sight of faith is butt in part, this life of the ffather and of christ is but in its infancy, in a riddle in much obscurety and child'fection in us, y=t= we cannot but continually say that the father and christ are farr greater, and if wee thinke wee knowe anythinge, or are anythinge, wee knowe nothing as wee ought to knowe, wee are nothing.",m
