2,"Sulpice, turned to the left.",m
3,They crossed the Place St.,m
4,"Germain des Pres, where lines of homebound working people stood waiting for places in the electric trams, and groups of students from the Beaux Arts or from Julien's sat under the awnings of the Deux Magots, and so, beyond that busy square, they came into the long and peaceful stretch of the Boulevard St.",m
5,Germain.,m
6,"The warm sweet dusk gathered round them as they went, and the evening air was fresh and aromatic in their faces.",m
7,"There had been a little gentle shower in the late afternoon, and roadway and pavement were still damp with it.",m
8,It had wet the new-grown leaves of the chestnuts and acacias that bordered the street.,m
9,"The scent of that living green blended with the scent of laid dust and the fragrance of the last late-clinging chestnut blossoms: it caught up a fuller richer burden from the overflowing front of a florist's shop: it stole from open windows a savoury whiff of cooking, a salt tang of wood smoke, and the soft little breeze--the breeze of coming summer--mixed all together and tossed them and bore them down the long quiet street; and it was the breath of Paris, and it shall be in your nostrils and mine, a keen agony of sweetness, so long as we may live and so wide as we may wander--because we have known it and loved it: and in the end we shall go back to breathe it when we die.",m
10,"The strong white horse jogged evenly along over the wooden pavement, its head down, the little bell at its neck jingling pleasantly as it went.",m
11,"The cocher, a torpid purplish lump of gross flesh, pyramidal, pear-like, sat immobile in his place.",m
12,The protuberant back gave him an extraordinary effect of being buttoned into his fawn-coloured coat wrong-side-before.,m
13,"At intervals he jerked the reins like a large strange toy and his strident voice said--  ""He!"" to the stout white horse, which paid no attention whatever.",m
14,"Once the beast stumbled and the pear-like lump of flesh insulted it, saying--  ""He! veux, tu, cochon!""",m
15,"Before the War Office a little black slip of a milliner's girl dodged under the horse's head, saving herself and the huge box slung to her arm by a miracle of agility, and the cocher called her the most frightful names, without turning his head, and in a perfunctory tone quite free from passion.",m
16,"Young Hartley laughed and turned to look at his companion, but Ste.",m
17,"Marie sat still in his place, his hat pulled a little down over his brows, and his handsome chin buried in the folds of the white silk muffler with which, for some obscure reason, he had swathed his neck.",m
18,"""This is the first time in many years,"" said the Englishman, ""that I have known you to be silent for ten whole minutes.",m
19,"Are you ill or are you making up little epigrams to say at the dinner party?""",m
20,Ste.,m
21,Marie waved a despondent glove.,m
22,"""I 'ave,"" said he, ""w'at you call ze blue.",m
23,"Papillons noirs--clouds in my soul.""",m
24,It was a species of jest with Ste.,m
25,Marie--and he seemed never to tire of it--to pretend that he spoke English very brokenly.,m
26,As a matter of fact he spoke it quite as well as any Englishman and without the slightest trace of accent.,m
27,"He had discovered a long time before this--it may have been while the two were at Eton together--that it annoyed Hartley very much, particularly when it was done in company and before strangers.",m
28,"In consequence he became at such occasions a sort of comic-paper caricature of his race, and by dint of much practice, added to a naturally alert mind, he became astonishingly ingenious in the torture of that honest but unimaginative gentleman whom he considered his best friend.",m
29,"He achieved the most surprising expressions by the mere literal translation of French idiom, and he could at any time bring Hartley to a crimson agony by calling him ""my dear"" before other men, whereas at the equivalent ""mon cher"" the Englishman would doubtless never, as the phrase goes, have batted an eye.",m
30,"""Ye--es,"" he continued sadly, ""I 'ave ze blue.",m
31,I weep.,m
32,Weez ze tears full ze eyes.,m
33,"Yes.""",m
34,He descended into English.,m
35,"""I think something's going to happen to me.",m
36,There's calamity--or something--in the air.,m
37,"Perhaps I'm going to die.""",m
38,"""Oh, I know what you are going to do, right enough,"" said the other man, ""you're going to meet the most beautiful woman--girl--in the world at dinner, and of course you are going to fall in love with her.""",m
39,"""Ah, the Miss Benham!"" said Ste.",m
40,Marie with a faint show of interest.,m
41,"""I remember now, you said that she was to be there.",m
42,I had forgotten.,m
43,"Yes, I shall be glad to meet her.",m
44,One hears so much.,m
45,"But why am I of course going to fall in love with her?""",m
46,"""Well, in the first place,"" said Hartley, ""you always fall in love with all pretty women as a matter of habit, and, in the second place, everybody--well, I suppose you--no one could help falling in love with her, I should think.""",m
47,"""That's high praise to come from you,"" said the other, and Hartley said with a short, not very mirthful laugh--  ""Oh, I don't pretend to be immune.",m
48,"We all--everybody who knows her---- You'll understand presently.""",m
49,Ste.,m
50,"Marie turned his head a little and looked curiously at his friend, for he considered that he knew the not very expressive intonations of that young gentleman's voice rather well, and this was something unusual.",m
51,He wondered what had been happening during his six months' absence from Paris.,m
52,"""I dare say that's what I feel in the air, then,"" he said after a little pause.",m
53,"""It's not calamity.",m
54,It's love.,m
55,"""Or maybe,"" he said quaintly, ""it's both.",m
56,"L'un n'empeche pas l'autre.""",m
57,"And he gave an odd little shiver, as if that something in the air had suddenly blown chill upon him.",m
58,They were passing the corner of the Chamber of Deputies which faces the Pont de la Concorde.,m
59,Ste.,m
60,Marie pulled out his watch and looked at it.,m
61,"""Eight-fifteen,"" said he.",m
62,"""What time are we asked for?",m
63,Eight-thirty?,m
64,That means nine.,m
65,It's an English house and nobody will be in time.,m
66,"It's out of fashion to be prompt nowadays.""",m
67,"""I should hardly call the Marquis de Saulnes English, you know!"" objected Hartley.",m
68,"""Well, his wife is,"" said the other, ""and they're altogether English in manner.",m
69,Dinner won't be before nine.,m
70,Shall we get out and walk across the bridge and up the Champs Elysees?,m
71,"I should like to, I think.",m
72,"I like to walk at this time of the evening--between the daylight and the dark.""",m
73,"Hartley nodded a rather reluctant assent, and Ste.",m
74,Marie prodded the pear-shaped cocher in the back with his stick.,m
75,So they got down at the approach to the bridge.,m
76,Ste.,m
77,Marie gave the cocher a piece of two francs and they turned away on foot.,m
78,"The pear-shaped one looked at the coin in his fat hand as if it was something unclean and contemptible, something to be despised.",m
79,"He glanced at the dial of his taximeter, which had registered one franc twenty-five, and pulled the flag up.",m
80,He spat gloomily out into the street and his purple lips moved in words.,m
81,"He seemed to say something like: ""Sale diable de metier!"" which, considering the fact that he had just been overpaid, appears unwarrantably pessimistic in tone.",m
82,"Thereafter he spat again, picked up his reins and jerked them, saying--  ""He, Jean Baptiste!",m
83,"Uip, uip!""",m
84,"The unemotional white horse turned up the boulevard, trotting evenly at its steady pace, head down, the little bell at its neck jingling pleasantly as it went.",m
85,It occurs to me that the white horse was probably unique.,m
86,I doubt that there was another horse in Paris rejoicing in that extraordinary name.,m
87,But the two young men walked slowly on across the Pont de la Concorde.,m
88,"They went in silence, for Hartley was thinking still of Miss Helen Benham and Ste.",m
89,Marie was thinking of Heaven knows what.,m
90,His gloom was unaccountable unless he had really meant what he said about feeling calamity in the air.,m
91,It was very unlike him to have nothing to say.,m
92,"Midway of the bridge he stopped and turned to look out over the river, and the other man halted beside him.",m
93,"The dusk was thickening almost perceptibly, but it was yet far from dark.",m
94,"The swift river ran leaden beneath them, and the river boats, mouches and hirondelles, darted silently under the arches of the bridge, making their last trips for the day.",m
95,"Away to the west, where their faces were turned, the sky was still faintly washed with colour, lemon and dusky orange and pale thin green.",m
96,"A single long strip of cirrus cloud was touched with pink, a lifeless old rose, such as is popular among decorators for the silk hangings of a woman's boudoir.",m
97,And black against this pallid wash of colours the Tour Eiffel stood high and slender and rather ghostly.,m
98,"By day it is an ugly thing, a preposterous iron finger upthrust by man's vanity against God's serene sky, but the haze of evening drapes it in a merciful semi-obscurity, and it is beautiful.",m
99,Ste.,m
100,"Marie leant upon the parapet of the bridge, arms folded before him and eyes afar.",m
101,"He began to sing, a demi voix, a little phrase out of Louise,--an invocation to Paris--and the Englishman stirred uneasily beside him.",m
102,"It seemed to Hartley that to stand on a bridge, in a top hat and evening clothes, and sing operatic airs while people passed back and forth behind you, was one of the things that are not done.",m
103,"He tried to imagine himself singing in the middle of Westminster Bridge at half-past eight of an evening, and he felt quite hot all over at the thought.",m
104,It was not done at all he said to himself.,m
105,"He looked a little nervously at the people who were passing, and it seemed to him that they stared at him and at the unconscious Ste.",m
106,"Marie, though in truth they did nothing of the sort.",m
107,"He turned back and touched his friend on the arm, saying--  ""I think we'd best be getting along, you know,"" but Ste.",m
108,Marie was very far away and did not hear.,m
109,"So then he fell to watching the man's dark and handsome face, and to thinking how little the years at Eton and the year or two at Oxford had set any real stamp upon him.",m
110,He would never be anything but Latin in spite of his Irish mother and his public school.,m
111,Hartley thought what a pity that was.,m
112,"As Englishmen go he was not illiberal, but, no more than he could have altered the colour of his eyes, could he have believed that anything foreign would not be improved by becoming English.",m
113,"That was born in him, as it is born in most Englishmen, and it was a perfectly simple and honest belief.",m
114,"He felt a deeper affection for this handsome and volatile young man, whom all women loved and who bade fair to spend his life at their successive feet--for he certainly had never shown the slightest desire to take up any sterner employment--he felt a deeper affection for Ste.",m
115,"Marie than for any other man he knew, but he had always wished that Ste.",m
116,"Marie were an Englishman, and he had always felt a slight sense of shame over his friend's un-English ways.",m
117,"After a moment he touched him again on the arm, saying--  ""Come along!",m
118,"We shall be late, you know.",m
119,"You can finish your little concert another time.""",m
120,"""Eh!"" cried Ste.",m
121,Marie.,m
122,"""Quoi, donc?""",m
123,He turned with a start.,m
124,"""Oh yes!"" said he.",m
125,"""Yes, come along!",m
126,I was mooning.,m
127,Allons!,m
128,"Allons, my old!""",m
129,He took Hartley's arm and began to shove him along at a rapid walk.,m
130,"""I will moon no more,"" he said.",m
131,"""Instead, you shall tell me about the wonderful Miss Benham whom everybody is talking of.",m
132,Isn't there something odd connected with the family?,m
133,"I vaguely recall something unusual, some mystery or misfortune or something.",m
134,"""But first a moment!",m
135,"One small moment, my old.",m
136,"Regard me that!""",m
137,They had come to the end of the bridge and the great Place de la Concorde lay before them.,m
138,"""In all the world,"" said Ste.",m
139,"Marie--and he spoke the truth--""there is not another such square.",m
140,"Regard it, mon brave!",m
141,Bow yourself before it!,m
142,"It is a miracle.""",m
143,"The great bronze lamps were alight, and they cast reflections upon the still damp pavement about them.",m
144,To either side the trees of the Tuileries gardens and of the Cours la Reine and the Champs Elysees lay in a solid black mass.,m
145,"In the middle the obelisk rose slender and straight, its pointed top black against the sky, and beneath the water of the Nereid fountains splashed and gurgled.",m
146,"Far beyond, the gay lights of the Rue Royale shone in a yellow cluster and, beyond these still, the tall columns of the Madeleine ended the long vista.",m
147,"Pedestrians and cabs crept across that vast space, and seemed curiously little, like black insects, and round about it all the eight cities of France sat atop their stone pedestals and looked on.",m
148,Ste.,m
149,"Marie gave a little sigh of pleasure, and the two moved forward, bearing to the left, towards the Champs Elysees.",m
150,"""And now,"" said he, ""about these Benhams.",m
151,What is the thing I cannot quite recall?,m
152,"What has happened to them?""",m
153,"""I suppose,"" said the other man, ""you mean the disappearance of Miss Benham's young brother, a month ago, before you returned to Paris.",m
154,"Yes, that was certainly very odd.",m
155,"That is, it was either very odd or very commonplace.",m
156,And in either case the family is terribly cut up about it.,m
157,"The boy's name was Arthur Benham, and he was rather a young fool but not downright vicious, I should think.",m
158,"I never knew him at all well, but I know he spent his time chiefly at the Cafe de Paris and at the Olympia and at Longchamps and at Henry's Bar.",m
159,"Well, he just disappeared, that is all.",m
160,"He dropped completely out of sight between two days, and though the family has had a small army of detectives on his trail, they've not discovered the smallest clue.",m
161,It's deuced odd altogether.,m
162,"You might think it easy to disappear like that but it's not.""",m
163,"""No--no,"" said Ste.",m
164,Marie thoughtfully.,m
165,"""No, I should fancy not.",m
166,"""This boy,"" he said after a pause, ""I think I had seen him--had him pointed out to me--before I went away.",m
167,I think it was at Henry's Bar where all the young Americans go to drink strange beverages.,m
168,I am quite sure I remember his face.,m
169,"A weak face but not quite bad.""",m
170,"And after another little pause he asked--  ""Was there any reason why he should have gone away?",m
171,"Any quarrel or that sort of thing?""",m
172,"""Well,"" said the other man, ""I rather think there was something of the sort.",m
173,"The boy's uncle--Captain Stewart, middle-aged, rather prim old party--you'll have met him, I dare say--he intimated to me one day, that there had been some trivial row.",m
174,"You see the lad isn't of age yet, though he is to be in a few months, and so he has had to live on an allowance doled out by his grandfather, who's the head of the house--the boy's father is dead.",m
175,"There's a quaint old beggar, if you like!--the grandfather.",m
176,"He was rather a swell in the diplomatic, in his day it seems--rather an important swell.",m
177,Now he's bedridden.,m
178,"He sits all day in bed and plays cards with his granddaughter or with a very superior valet, and talks politics with the men who come to see him.",m
179,"Oh yes, he's a quaint old beggar.",m
180,"He has a great quantity of white hair and an enormous square white beard, and the fiercest eyes I ever saw, I should think.",m
181,Everybody's frightened out of their wits of him.,m
182,"Well, he sits up there and rules his family in good old patriarchal style, and it seems he came down a bit hard on the poor boy one day over some folly or other, and there was a row and the boy went out of the house swearing he'd be even.""",m
183,"""Ah well, then,"" said Ste.",m
184,"Marie, ""the matter seems simple enough.",m
185,A foolish boy's foolish pique.,m
186,He is staying in hiding somewhere to frighten his grandfather.,m
187,"When he thinks the time favourable he will come back and be wept over and forgiven.""",m
188,The other man walked a little way in silence.,m
189,"""Ye--es,"" he said at last.",m
190,"""Yes, possibly.",m
191,Possibly you are right.,m
192,That's what the grandfather thinks.,m
193,It's the obvious solution.,m
194,Unfortunately there is more or less against it.,m
195,"The boy went away with--so far as can be learned--almost no money, almost none at all.",m
196,And he has already been gone a month.,m
197,"Miss Benham--his sister--is sure that something has happened to him, and I'm a bit inclined to think so too.",m
198,It's all very odd.,m
199,"I should think he might have been kidnapped but that no demand has been made for money.""",m
200,"""He was not,"" suggested Ste.",m
201,"Marie--""not the sort of young man to do anything desperate--make away with himself?""",m
202,Hartley laughed.,m
203,"""O Lord, no!"" said he.",m
204,"""Not that sort of young man at all.",m
205,"He was a very normal type of rich and spoilt and somewhat foolish American boy.""",m
206,"""Rich?"" inquired the other quickly.",m
207,"""Oh yes! they're beastly rich.",m
208,"Young Arthur is to come into something very good at his majority, I believe, from his father's estate, and the old grandfather is said to be indecently rich--rolling in it!",m
209,There's another reason why the young idiot wouldn't be likely to stop away of his own accord.,m
210,He wouldn't risk anything like a serious break with the old gentleman.,m
211,"It would mean a loss of millions to him, I dare say; for the old beggar is quite capable of cutting him off, if he takes the notion.",m
212,"Oh, it's a bad business, all through.""",m
213,"And after they had gone on a bit he said it again, shaking his head--  ""It's a bad business!",m
214,That poor girl you know--it's hard on her.,m
215,She was fond of the young ass for some reason or other.,m
216,"She's very much broken up over it.""",m
217,"""Yes,"" said Ste.",m
218,"Marie, ""it is hard for her--for all the family, of course.",m
219,"A bad business, as you say.""",m
220,"He spoke absently, for he was looking ahead at something which seemed to be a motor accident.",m
221,"They had, by this time, got well up the Champs Elysees and were crossing the Rond Point.",m
222,"A motor-car was drawn up alongside the kerb just beyond, and a little knot of people stood about it and seemed to look at something on the ground.",m
223,"""I think some one has been run down,"" said Ste.",m
224,Marie.,m
225,"""Shall we have a look?""",m
226,"They quickened their pace and came to where the group of people stood in a circle looking upon the ground, and two gendarmes asked many questions and wrote voluminously in their little books.",m
227,"It appeared that a delivery boy mounted upon a tricycle cart had turned into the wrong side of the avenue, and had got himself run into and overturned by a motor-car going at a moderate rate of speed.",m
228,"For once the sentiment of those mysterious birds of prey which flock instantaneously from nowhere round an accident, was against the victim and in favour of the frightened and gesticulating chauffeur.",m
229,Ste.,m
230,"Marie turned an amused face from this voluble being to the other occupants of the patently hired car, who stood apart adding very little to the discussion.",m
231,He saw a tall and bony man with very bright blue eyes and what is sometimes called a guardsman's moustache--the drooping walruslike ornament which dates back a good many years now.,m
232,Beyond this gentleman he saw a young woman in a long grey silk coat and a motoring veil.,m
233,"He was aware that the tall man was staring at him rather fixedly and with a half-puzzled frown, as though he thought that they had met before and was trying to remember when, but Ste.",m
234,Marie gave the man but a swift glance.,m
235,"His eyes were upon the dark face of the young woman beyond, and it seemed to him that she called aloud to him in an actual voice that rang in his ears.",m
236,The young woman's very obvious beauty he thought had nothing to do with the matter.,m
237,It seemed to him that her eyes called him.,m
238,Just that.,m
239,"Something strange and very potent seemed to take sudden and almost tangible hold upon him--a charm, a spell, a magic--something unprecedented, new to his experience.",m
240,He could not take his eyes from hers and he stood staring.,m
241,"As before, on the Pont de la Concorde, Hartley touched him on the arm, and abruptly the chains that had bound him were loosened.",m
242,"""We must be going on, you know,"" the Englishman said, and Ste.",m
243,"Marie said rather hurriedly--  ""Yes! yes, to be sure.",m
244,"Come along!""",m
245,But at a little distance he turned once more to look back.,m
246,"The chauffeur had mounted to his place, the delivery boy was upon his feet again, little the worse for his tumble, and the knot of bystanders had begun to disperse, but it seemed to Ste.",m
247,"Marie that the young woman in the long silk coat stood quite still where she had been, and that her face was turned towards him watching.",m
248,"""Did you notice that girl?"" said Hartley as they walked on at a brisker pace.",m
249,"""Did you see her face?",m
250,"She was rather a tremendous beauty, you know, in her gipsyish fashion.",m
251,"Yes, by Jove, she was!""",m
252,"""Did I see her?"" repeated Ste.",m
253,Marie.,m
254,"""Yes.",m
255,Oh yes.,m
256,She had very strange eyes.,m
257,At least I think it was the eyes.,m
258,I don't know.,m
259,I've never seen any eyes quite like them.,m
260,"Very odd!""",m
261,"He said something more in French which Hartley did not hear, and the Englishman saw that he was frowning.",m
262,"""Oh well, I shouldn't have said there was anything strange about them,"" Hartley said, ""but they certainly were beautiful.",m
263,There's no denying that.,m
264,"The man with her looked rather Irish I thought.""",m
265,They came to the Etoile and cut across it towards the Avenue Hoche.,m
266,Ste.,m
267,"Marie glanced back once more, but the motor-car and the delivery boy and the gendarmes were gone.",m
268,"""What did you say?"" he asked idly.",m
269,"""I said the man looked Irish,"" repeated his friend.",m
270,All at once Ste.,m
271,"Marie gave a loud exclamation--  ""Sacred thousand devils!",m
272,Fool that I am!,m
273,Dolt!,m
274,"Why didn't I think of it before?""",m
275,Hartley stared at him and Ste.,m
276,Marie stared down the Champs Elysees like one in a trance.,m
277,"""I say,"" said the Englishman, ""we really must be getting on, you know, we're late.""",m
278,"And as they went along down the Avenue Hoche, he demanded--  ""Why are you a dolt and whatever else it was?",m
279,"What struck you so suddenly?""",m
280,"""I remembered all at once,"" said Ste.",m
281,"Marie, ""where I had seen that man before, and with whom I last saw him.",m
282,I'll tell you about it later.,m
283,"Probably it's of no importance, though.""",m
284,"""You're talking rather like a mild lunatic,"" said the other.",m
285,"""Here we are at the house!""                                                               Miss Benham was talking wearily to a strange fair youth with an impediment in his speech, and was wondering why the youth had been asked to this house, where in general one was sure of meeting only interesting people, when some one spoke her name, and she turned with a little sigh of relief.",m
286,"It was Baron de Vries, the Belgian First Secretary of Legation, an old friend of her grandfather's, a man made gentle and sweet by infinite sorrow.",m
287,He bowed civilly to the fair youth and bent over the girl's hand.,m
288,"""It is very good,"" he said, ""to see you again in the world.",m
289,"We have need of you, nous autres.",m
290,"Madame your mother is well, I hope--and the bear?""",m
291,"He called old Mr. Stewart ""the bear"" in a sort of grave jest, and that fierce octogenarian rather liked it.",m
292,"""Oh yes,"" the girl said, ""we're all fairly well.",m
293,"My mother had one of her headaches to-night and so didn't come here, but she's as well as usual, and 'the bear'--yes, he's well enough physically, I should think, but he has not been quite the same since--during the past month.",m
294,"It has told upon him, you know.",m
295,"He grieves over it much more than he will admit.""",m
296,"""Yes,"" said Baron de Vries gravely.",m
297,"""Yes, I know.""",m
298,"He turned about towards the fair young man, but that youth had drifted away and joined himself to another group.",m
299,Miss Benham looked after him and gave a little exclamation of relief.,m
300,"""That person was rather terrible,"" she said.",m
301,"""I can't think why he is here.",m
302,"Marian so seldom has dull people.""",m
303,"""I believe,"" said the Belgian, ""that he is some connexion of de Saulnes'.",m
304,"That explains his presence.""",m
305,He lowered his voice.,m
306,"""You have heard no--news?",m
307,"They have found no trace?""",m
308,"""No,"" said she.",m
309,"""Nothing.",m
310,Nothing at all.,m
311,I'm rather in despair.,m
312,It's all so hideously mysterious.,m
313,"I am sure, you know, that something has happened to him.",m
314,It's--very very hard.,m
315,Sometimes I think I can't bear it.,m
316,But I go on.,m
317,"We all go on.""",m
318,Baron de Vries nodded his head strongly.,m
319,"""That, my dear child, is just what you must do,"" said he.",m
320,"""You must go on.",m
321,That is what needs the real courage and you have courage.,m
322,I am not afraid for you.,m
323,And sooner or later you will hear of him--from him.,m
324,It is impossible nowadays to disappear for very long.,m
325,"You will hear from him.""",m
326,"He smiled at her, his slow grave smile that was not of mirth but of kindness and sympathy and cheer.",m
327,"""And if I may say so,"" he said, ""you are doing very wisely to come out once more among your friends.",m
328,You can accomplish no good by brooding at home.,m
329,It is better to live one's normal life--even when it is not easy to do it.,m
330,"I say so who know.""",m
331,The girl touched Baron de Vries' arm for an instant with her hand--a little gesture that seemed to express thankfulness and trust and affection.,m
332,"""If all my friends were like you!"" she said to him.",m
333,"And after that she drew a quick breath as if to have done with these sad matters, and she turned her eyes once more towards the broad room where the other guests stood in little groups, all talking at once very rapidly and in loud voices.",m
334,"""What extraordinarily cosmopolitan affairs these dinner parties in new Paris are!"" she said.",m
335,"""They're like diplomatic parties, only we have a better time and the men don't wear their orders.",m
336,"How many nationalities should you say there are in this room now?""",m
337,"""Without stopping to consider,"" said Baron de Vries, ""I say ten.""",m
338,"They counted, and out of fourteen people there were represented nine races.",m
339,"""I don't see Richard Hartley,"" Miss Benham said.",m
340,"""I had an idea he was to be here.",m
341,"Ah!"" she broke off, looking towards the doorway.",m
342,"""Here he comes now!"" she said.",m
343,"""He's rather late.",m
344,"Who is the Spanish-looking man with him, I wonder?",m
345,"He's rather handsome, isn't he?""",m
346,"Baron de Vries moved a little forward to look, and exclaimed in his turn.",m
347,"He said--  ""Ah, I did not know he was returned to Paris.",m
348,That is Ste.,m
349,"Marie.""",m
350,Miss Benham's eyes followed the Spanish-looking young man as he made his way through the joyous greetings of friends towards his hostess.,m
351,"""So that is Ste.",m
352,"Marie!"" she said, still watching him.",m
353,"""The famous Ste.",m
354,"Marie!""",m
355,She gave a little laugh.,m
356,"""Well, I don't wonder at the reputation he bears for--gallantry and that sort of thing.",m
357,"He looks the part, doesn't he?""",m
358,"""Ye--es,"" admitted her friend.",m
359,"""Yes, he is sufficiently beau garcon.",m
360,"But--yes, well, that is not all, by any means.",m
361,You must not get the idea that Ste.,m
362,Marie is nothing but a genial and romantic young squire-of-dames.,m
363,He is much more than that.,m
364,He has very fine qualities.,m
365,"To be sure he appears to possess no ambition in particular, but I should be glad if he were my son.",m
366,"He comes of a very old house, and there is no blot upon the history of that house--nothing but faithfulness and gallantry and honour.",m
367,"And there is, I think, no blot upon Ste.",m
368,Marie himself.,m
369,"He is fine gold.""",m
370,The girl turned and stared at Baron de Vries with some astonishment.,m
371,"""You speak very strongly,"" said she.",m
372,"""I have never heard you speak so strongly of any one, I think.""",m
373,"The Belgian made a little deprecatory gesture with his two hands, and he laughed.",m
374,"""Oh well, I like the boy.",m
375,And I should hate to have you meet him for the first time under a misconception.,m
376,"Listen, my child!",m
377,"When a young man is loved equally by both men and women, by both old and young, that young man is worthy of friendship and trust.",m
378,Everybody likes Ste.,m
379,Marie.,m
380,In a sense that is his misfortune.,m
381,The way is made too easy for him.,m
382,His friends stand so thick about him that they shut off his view of the heights.,m
383,To waken ambition in his soul he has need of solitude or misfortune or grief.,m
384,"""Or,"" said the elderly Belgian, laughing gently, ""or perhaps the other thing might do it best--the more obvious thing?""",m
385,"The girl's raised eyebrows questioned him and, when he did not answer, she said--  ""What thing then?""",m
386,"""Why, love,"" said Baron de Vries.",m
387,"""Love, to be sure.",m
388,"Love is said to work miracles, and I believe that to be a perfectly true saying.",m
389,"Ah! he is coming here.""",m
390,"The Marquise de Saulnes, who was a very pretty little Englishwoman with a deceptively doll-like look, approached, dragging Ste.",m
391,Marie in her wake.,m
392,"She said--  ""My dearest dear, I give you of my best.",m
393,"Thank me, and cherish him!",m
394,"I believe he is to lead you to the place where food is, isn't he?""",m
395,"She beamed over her shoulder, and departed, and Miss Benham found herself confronted by the Spanish-looking man.",m
396,Her first thought was that he was not as handsome as he had seemed at a distance but something much better.,m
397,"For a young man she thought his face was rather oddly weather-beaten, as if he might have been very much at sea, and it was too dark to be entirely pleasing.",m
398,"But she liked his eyes, which were not brown or black, as she had expected, but a very unusual dark grey--a sort of slate colour.",m
399,And she liked his mouth too.,m
400,It was her habit--and it is not an unreliable habit--to judge people by their eyes and mouth.,m
401,Ste.,m
402,"Marie's mouth pleased her because the lips were neither thin nor thick, they were not drawn into an unpleasant line by unpleasant habits, they did not pout as so many Latin lips do, and they had at one corner a humorous expression which she found curiously agreeable.",m
403,"""You are to cherish me,"" Ste.",m
404,Marie said.,m
405,"""Orders from headquarters.",m
406,"How does one cherish people?""",m
407,The corner of his very expressive mouth twitched and he grinned at her.,m
408,Miss Benham did not approve of young men who began an acquaintance in this very familiar manner.,m
409,"She thought that there was a certain preliminary and more formal stage which ought to be got through with first, but Ste.",m
410,Marie's grin was irresistible.,m
411,In spite of herself she found that she was laughing.,m
412,"""I don't quite know,"" she said.",m
413,"""It sounds rather appalling, doesn't it?",m
414,Marian has such an extraordinary fashion of hurling people at each other's heads.,m
415,"She takes my breath away at times.""",m
416,"""Ah well,"" said Ste.",m
417,"Marie, ""perhaps we can settle upon something when I've led you to the place where food is.",m
418,"And, by the way, what are we waiting for?",m
419,Are we not all here?,m
420,"There's an even number.""",m
421,"He broke off with a sudden exclamation of pleasure, and, when Miss Benham turned to look, she found Baron de Vries, who had been talking to some friends, had once more come up to where she stood.",m
422,"She watched the greeting between the two men, and its quiet affection impressed her very much.",m
423,"She knew Baron de Vries well, and she knew that it was not his habit to show or to feel a strong liking for young and idle men.",m
424,This young man must be very worth while to have won the regard of that wise old Belgian.,m
425,"Just then Hartley, who had been barricaded behind a cordon of friends, came up to her in an abominable temper over his ill luck, and, a few moments later, the dinner procession was formed and they went in.",m
426,At table Miss Benham found herself between Ste.,m
427,Marie and the same strange fair youth who had afflicted her in the drawing-room.,m
428,"She looked upon him now with a sort of dismayed terror, but it developed that there was nothing to fear from the fair youth.",m
429,He had no attention to waste upon social amenities.,m
430,"He fell upon his food with a wolfish passion extraordinary to see and also, alas! to hear.",m
431,Miss Benham turned from him to meet Ste.,m
432,Marie's delighted eye.,m
433,"""Tell him for me,"" begged that gentleman, ""that soup should be seen--not heard.""",m
434,But Miss Benham gave a little shiver of disgust.,m
435,"""I shall tell him nothing whatever,"" she said.",m
436,"""He's quite too dreadful really.",m
437,People shouldn't be exposed to that sort of thing.,m
438,It's not only the noises.,m
439,"Plenty of very charming and estimable Germans, for example, make strange noises at table.",m
440,But he behaves like a famished dog over a bone.,m
441,I refuse to have anything to do with him.,m
442,"You must make up the loss to me, M. Ste.",m
443,Marie.,m
444,"You must be as amusing as two people.""",m
445,She smiled across at him in her gravely questioning fashion.,m
446,"""I'm wondering,"" she said, ""if I dare ask you a very personal question.",m
447,"I hesitate because I don't like people who presume too much upon a short acquaintance--and our acquaintance has been very very short, hasn't it? even though we may have heard a great deal about each other beforehand.",m
448,"I wonder.""",m
449,"""Oh, I should ask it, if I were you!"" said Ste.",m
450,Marie at once.,m
451,"""I'm an extremely good-natured person.",m
452,"And besides I quite naturally feel flattered at your taking interest enough to ask anything about me.""",m
453,"""Well,"" said she, ""it's this.",m
454,Why does everybody call you just 'Ste.,m
455,Marie'?,m
456,Most people are spoken of as Monsieur this or that--if there isn't a more august title--but they all call you Ste.,m
457,Marie without any Monsieur.,m
458,"It seems rather odd.""",m
459,Ste.,m
460,Marie looked puzzled.,m
461,"""Why,"" he said, ""I don't believe I know, just.",m
462,I'd never thought of that.,m
463,"It's quite true, of course.",m
464,"They never do use a Monsieur or anything, do they?",m
465,How cheeky of them!,m
466,I wonder why it is.,m
467,"I'll ask Hartley.""",m
468,He did ask Hartley later on and Hartley didn't know either.,m
469,"Miss Benham asked some other people, who were vague about it, and in the end she became convinced that it was an odd and quite inexplicable form of something like endearment.",m
470,But nobody seemed to have formulated it to himself.,m
471,"""The name is really 'de Ste.",m
472,"Marie',"" he went on, ""and there's a title that I don't use, and a string of Christian names that one employs.",m
473,"My people were Bearnais, and there's a heap of ruins on top of a hill in the Pyrenees where they lived.",m
474,It used to be Ste.,m
475,"Marie de Mont-les-Roses, but afterwards, after the Revolution, they called it Ste.",m
476,Marie de Mont Perdu.,m
477,"My great-grandfather was killed there, but some old servants smuggled his little son away and saved him.""",m
478,"He seemed to Miss Benham to say that in exactly the right manner, not in the cheap and scoffing fashion which some young men affect in speaking of ancestral fortunes or misfortunes, nor with too much solemnity.",m
479,"And when she allowed a little silence to occur at the end he did not go on with his family history, but turned at once to another subject.",m
480,It pleased her curiously.,m
481,"The fair youth at her other side continued to crouch over his food, making fierce and animal-like noises.",m
482,"He never spoke or seemed to wish to be spoken to, and Miss Benham found it easy to ignore him altogether.",m
483,It occurred to her once or twice that Ste.,m
484,"Marie's other neighbour might desire an occasional word from him, but after all, she said to herself, that was his affair and beyond her control.",m
485,"So these two talked together through the entire dinner period, and the girl was aware that she was being much more deeply affected by the simple magnetic charm of a man than ever before in her life.",m
486,"It made her a little angry, because she was unfamiliar with this sort of thing and distrusted it.",m
487,"She was a rather perfect type of that phenomenon before which the British and Continental world stands in mingled delight and exasperation--the American unmarried young woman, the creature of extraordinary beauty and still more extraordinary poise, the virgin with the bearing and savoir faire of a woman of the world, the fresh-cheeked girl with the calm mind of a savant and the cool judgment, in regard to men and things, of an ambassador.",m
488,"The European world says she is cold, and that may be true; but it is well enough known that she can love very deeply.",m
489,"It says that, like most queens, and for precisely the same set of reasons, she later on makes a bad mother; but it is easy to point to queens who are the best of mothers.",m
490,"In short, she remains an enigma, and like all other enigmas forever fascinating.",m
491,Miss Benham reflected that she knew almost nothing about Ste.,m
492,"Marie, save for his reputation as a carpet knight, and Baron de Vries' good opinion, which could not be despised.",m
493,And that made her the more displeased when she realised how promptly she was surrendering to his charm.,m
494,In a moment of silence she gave a sudden little laugh which seemed to express a half-angry astonishment.,m
495,"""What was that for?""",m
496,Ste.,m
497,Marie demanded.,m
498,The girl looked at him for an instant and shook her head.,m
499,"""I can't tell you,"" said she.",m
500,"""That's rude, isn't it, and I'm sorry.",m
501,"Perhaps I will tell you one day when we know each other better.""",m
502,"But inwardly she was saying: ""Why, I suppose this is how they all begin: all these regiments of women who make fools of themselves about him!",m
503,"I suppose this is exactly what he does to them all!""",m
504,"It made her angry and she tried quite unfairly to shift the anger, as it were, to Ste.",m
505,Marie--to put him somehow in the wrong.,m
506,"But she was by nature very just and she could not quite do that, particularly as it was evident that the man was using no cheap tricks.",m
507,"He did not try to flirt with her and he did not attempt to pay her veiled compliments--though she was often aware that when her attention was diverted for a few moments his eyes were always upon her, and that is a compliment that few women can find it in their hearts to resent.",m
508,"""You say,"" said Ste.",m
509,"Marie, ""'when we know each other better.'",m
510,"May one twist that into a permission to come and see you--I mean, really see you, not just leave a card at your door to-morrow by way of observing the formalities?""",m
511,"""Yes,"" she said.",m
512,"""Oh yes, one may twist it into something like that without straining it unduly, I think.",m
513,My mother and I shall be very glad to see you.,m
514,"I'm sorry she is not here to-night to say it herself.""",m
515,"Then the hostess began to gather together her flock, and so the two had no more speech.",m
516,"But when the women had gone and the men were left about the dismantled table, Hartley moved up beside Ste.",m
517,Marie and shook a sad head at him.,m
518,"He said--  ""You're a very lucky being.",m
519,"I was quietly hoping, on the way here, that I should be the fortunate man, but you always have all the luck.",m
520,"I hope you're decently grateful.""",m
521,"""Mon vieux,"" said Ste.",m
522,"Marie, ""my feet are upon the stars.""",m
523,"""No!""",m
524,He shook his head as if the figure displeased him.,m
525,"""No, my feet are upon the ladder to the stars.",m
526,Grateful?,m
527,What does a foolish word like grateful mean?,m
528,Don't talk to me.,m
529,You are not worthy to trample among my magnificent thoughts.,m
530,"I am a god upon Olympus.""",m
531,"""You said just now,"" objected the other man practically, ""that your feet were on a ladder.",m
532,"There are no ladders from Olympus to the stars.""",m
533,"""Ho!"" said Ste.",m
534,Marie.,m
535,"""Ho! aren't there, though?",m
536,There shall be ladders all over Olympus if I like.,m
537,What do you know about gods and stars?,m
538,"I shall be a god climbing to the heavens, and I shall be an angel of light, and I shall be a miserable worm grovelling in the night here below, and I shall be a poet, and I shall be anything else I happen to think of, all of them at once, if I choose.",m
539,"And you, you shall be the tongue-tied son of perfidious Albion that you are, gaping at my splendours from a fog bank--a November fog bank in May.",m
540,"Who is the dessicated gentleman bearing down upon us?""                                                Hartley looked over his shoulder and gave a little exclamation of distaste.",m
541,"""It's Captain Stewart, Miss Benham's uncle,"" he said, lowering his voice.",m
542,"""I'm off.",m
543,I shall abandon you to him.,m
544,"He's a good old soul but he bores me.""",m
545,"Hartley nodded to the man who was approaching, and then made his way to the end of the table where their host sat discussing Aero-Club matters with a group of the other men.",m
546,"Captain Stewart dropped into the vacant chair, saying--  ""May I recall myself to you, M. Ste.",m
547,Marie?,m
548,"We met, I believe, once or twice, a couple of years ago.",m
549,"My name's Stewart.""",m
550,"Captain Stewart--the title was vaguely believed to have been won some years before in the American service, but no one appeared to know much about it--was not an old man.",m
551,"He could not have been, at this time, much more than fifty, but English-speaking acquaintances often called him ""old Stewart"" and others ""ce vieux Stewart.""",m
552,"Indeed, at a first glance, he might have passed for anything up to sixty, for his face was a good deal more lined and wrinkled than it should have been at his age.",m
553,Ste.,m
554,Marie's adjective had been rather apt.,m
555,The man had a dessicated appearance.,m
556,"Upon examination, however, one saw that the blood was still red in his cheeks and lips, and, although his neck was thin and withered like an old man's, his brown eyes still held their fire.",m
557,"The hair was almost gone from the top of his large round head, but it remained at the sides, stiff colourless hair with a hint of red in it.",m
558,"And there were red streaks in his grey moustache, which was trained outwards in two loose tufts like shaving brushes.",m
559,The moustache and the shallow chin under it gave him an odd cat-like appearance.,m
560,"Hartley, who rather disliked the man, used to insist that he had heard him mew.",m
561,Ste.,m
562,"Marie said something politely non-committal, though he did not at all remember the alleged meeting two years before, and he looked at Captain Stewart with a real curiosity and interest, in his character as Miss Benham's uncle.",m
563,He thought it very civil of the elder man to make these friendly advances when it was in no way incumbent upon him to do so.,m
564,"""I noticed,"" said Captain Stewart, ""that you were placed next my niece, Helen Benham, at dinner.",m
565,"This must be the first time you two have met, is it not?",m
566,"I remember speaking of you to her some months ago, and I am quite sure she said that she had not met you.",m
567,"Ah! yes, of course, you have been away from Paris a great deal since she and her mother--her mother is my sister, that is to say, my half-sister--have come here to live with my father.""",m
568,He gave a little gentle laugh.,m
569,"""I take an elderly uncle's privilege,"" he said, ""of being rather proud of Helen.",m
570,"She is called very pretty and she certainly has great poise.""",m
571,Ste.,m
572,Marie drew a quick breath and his eyes began to flash as they had done a few moments before when he told Hartley that his feet were upon the ladder to the stars.,m
573,"""Miss Benham,"" he cried.",m
574,"""Miss Benham is----""  He hung poised so for a moment, searching, as it were, for words of sufficient splendour, but in the end he shook his head, and the gleam faded from his eyes.",m
575,He sank back in his chair sighing.,m
576,"""Miss Benham,"" said he, ""is extremely beautiful.""",m
577,And again her uncle emitted his little gentle laugh which may have deceived Hartley into believing that he had heard the man mew.,m
578,The sound was as much like mewing as it was like anything else.,m
579,"""I am very glad,"" Captain Stewart said, ""to see her come out once more into the world.",m
580,She needs distraction.,m
581,We--you may possibly have heard that the family is in great distress of mind over the disappearance of my young nephew.,m
582,Helen has suffered particularly because she is convinced that the boy has met with foul play.,m
583,"I myself think it very unlikely, very unlikely indeed.",m
584,"The lack of motive, for one thing, and for another----  Ah well, a score of reasons!",m
585,But Helen refuses to be comforted.,m
586,It seems to me much more like a boy's prank--his idea of revenge for what he considered unjust treatment at his grandfather's hands.,m
587,"He was always a headstrong youngster, and he has been a bit spoilt.",m
588,"Still, of course, the uncertainty is very trying for us all--very wearing.""",m
589,"""Of course,"" said Ste.",m
590,Marie gravely.,m
591,"""It is most unfortunate.",m
592,"Ah, by the way!""",m
593,He looked up with a sudden interest.,m
594,"""A rather odd thing happened,"" he said, ""as Hartley and I were coming here this evening.",m
595,"We walked up the Champs Elysees from the Concorde, and on the way Hartley had been telling me of your nephew's disappearance.",m
596,"Near the Rond Point we came upon a motor-car which was drawn up at the side of the street--there had been an accident of no consequence, a boy tumbled over but not hurt.",m
597,"Well, one of the two occupants of the motor-car was a man whom I used to see about Maxim's and the Cafe de Paris and the Montmartre places too, some time ago--a rather shady character whose name I've forgotten.",m
598,The odd part of it all was that at the last occasion or two on which I saw your nephew he was with this man.,m
599,I think it was in Henry's Bar.,m
600,Of course it means nothing at all.,m
601,"Your nephew doubtless knew scores of people, and this man is no more likely to have information about his present whereabouts than any of the others.",m
602,"Still, I should have liked to ask him.",m
603,"I didn't remember who he was till he had gone.""",m
604,"Captain Stewart shook his head sadly, frowning down upon the cigarette from which he had knocked the ash.",m
605,"""I am afraid poor Arthur did not always choose his friends with the best of judgment,"" said he.",m
606,"""I am not squeamish, and I would not have boys kept in a glass case, but----  Yes, I'm afraid Arthur was not always too careful.""",m
607,He replaced the cigarette neatly between his lips.,m
608,"""This man now, this man whom you saw to-night, what sort of looking man will he have been?""",m
609,"""Oh, a tall lean man,"" said Ste.",m
610,Marie.,m
611,"""A tall man with blue eyes and a heavy old-fashioned moustache.",m
612,"I just can't remember the name.""",m
613,"The smoke stood still for an instant over Captain Stewart's cigarette, and it seemed to Ste.",m
614,Marie that a little contortion of anger fled over the man's face and was gone again.,m
615,He stirred slightly in his chair.,m
616,"After a moment he said--  ""I fancy--from your description I fancy I know who the man was.",m
617,"If it is the man I am thinking of, the name is--Powers.",m
618,"He is, as you have said, a rather shady character, and I more than once warned my nephew against him.",m
619,Such people are not good companions for a boy.,m
620,"Yes, I warned him.""",m
621,"""Powers,"" said Ste.",m
622,"Marie, ""doesn't sound right to me, you know.",m
623,"I can't say the fellow's name myself, but I'm sure--that is, I think--it's not Powers.""",m
624,"""Oh yes,"" said Captain Stewart with an elderly man's half-querulous certainty.",m
625,"""Yes, the name is Powers.",m
626,I remember it well.,m
627,"And I remember----  Yes, it was odd, was it not, your meeting him like that just as you were talking of Arthur.",m
628,"You--oh, you didn't speak to him, you say?",m
629,"No! no, to be sure.",m
630,You didn't recognise him at once.,m
631,"Yes, it was odd.",m
632,"Of course, the man could have had nothing to do with poor Arthur's disappearance.",m
633,"His only interest in the boy at any time would have been for what money Arthur might have, and he carried none, or almost none, away with him when he vanished.",m
634,"Eh, poor lad!",m
635,"Where can he be to-night, I wonder?",m
636,"It's a sad business, M. Ste.",m
637,Marie.,m
638,"A sad business.""",m
639,"Captain Stewart fell into a sort of brooding silence, frowning down at the table before him and twisting with his thin fingers the little liqueur glass and the coffee cup which were there.",m
640,"Once or twice, Ste.",m
641,"Marie thought, the frown deepened and twisted into a sort of scowl, and the man's fingers twitched on the cloth of the table, but when at last the group at the other end of the board rose and began to move towards the door, Captain Stewart rose also and followed them.",m
642,"At the door he seemed to think of something, and touched Ste.",m
643,Marie upon the arm.,m
644,"""This, ah, Powers,"" he said in a low tone, ""this man whom you saw to-night.",m
645,You said he was one of two occupants of a motor-car.,m
646,Yes?,m
647,"Did you by any chance recognise the other?""",m
648,"""Oh, the other was a young woman,"" said Ste.",m
649,Marie.,m
650,"""No, I never saw her before.",m
651,"She was very handsome.""",m
652,Captain Stewart said something under his breath and turned abruptly away.,m
653,"But an instant later he faced about once more, smiling.",m
654,"He said, in a man-of-the-world manner which sat rather oddly upon him--  ""Ah well, we all have our little love affairs.",m
655,"I dare say this shady fellow has his.""",m
656,And for some obscure reason Ste.,m
657,Marie found the speech peculiarly offensive.,m
658,"In the drawing-room he had opportunity for no more than a word with Miss Benham, for Hartley, enraged over his previous ill success, cut in ahead of him and manoeuvred that young lady into a corner, where he sat before her turning a square and determined back to the world.",m
659,Ste.,m
660,"Marie listlessly played bridge for a time, but his attention was not upon it, and he was glad when the others at the table settled their accounts and departed to look in at a dance somewhere.",m
661,"After that he talked for a little with Marian de Saulnes, whom he liked and who made no secret of adoring him.",m
662,"She complained loudly that he was in a vile temper, which was not true: he was only restless and distrait and wanted to be alone; and so, at last, he took his leave without waiting for Hartley.",m
663,"Outside in the street he stood for a moment hesitating, and an expectant fiacre drew up before the house, the cocher raising an interrogative whip.",m
664,In the end Ste.,m
665,Marie shook his head and turned away on foot.,m
666,"It was a still sweet night of soft airs and a moonless starlit sky, and the man was very fond of walking in the dark.",m
667,"From the Etoile he walked down the Champs Elysees, but presently turned towards the river.",m
668,"His eyes were upon the mellow stars, his feet upon the ladder thereunto.",m
669,"He found himself crossing the Pont des Invalides, and halted midway to rest and look.",m
670,He laid his arms upon the bridge's parapet and turned his face outwards.,m
671,Against it bore a little gentle breeze that smelt of the purifying water below and of the night and of green things growing.,m
672,"Beneath him the river ran black as flowing ink, and across its troubled surface the coloured lights of the many bridges glittered very beautifully--swirling arabesques of gold and crimson.",m
673,"The noises of the city--beat of hoofs upon wooden pavements, horn of tram or motor-car, jingle of bell upon cab horse--came here faintly and as if from a great distance.",m
674,"Above the dark trees of the Cours la Reine the sky glowed softly golden, reflecting the million lights of Paris.",m
675,Ste.,m
676,"Marie closed his eyes and, against darkness, he saw the beautiful head of Helen Benham, the clear-cut exquisite modelling of feature and contour, the perfection of form and colour.",m
677,"Her eyes met his eyes, and they were very serene and calm and confident.",m
678,"She smiled at him, and the new contours into which her face fell with the smile were more perfect than before.",m
679,"He watched the turn of her head, and the grace of the movement was the uttermost effortless grace one dreams that a queen should have.",m
680,The heart of Ste.,m
681,Marie quickened in him and he would have gone down upon his knees.,m
682,"He was well aware that with the coming of this girl something unprecedented, wholly new to his experience had befallen him--an awakening to a new life.",m
683,He had been in love a very great many times.,m
684,He was usually in love.,m
685,"And each time his heart had gone through the same sweet and bitter anguish, the same sleepless nights had come and gone upon him, the eternal and ever-new miracle had wakened spring in his soul, had passed its summer solstice, had faded through autumnal regrets to winter's death; but through it all something within him had waited asleep.",m
686,"He found himself wondering dully what it was, wherein lay the great difference, and he could not answer the question he asked.",m
687,"He knew only that whereas before he had loved, he now went down upon prayerful knees to worship.",m
688,"In a sudden poignant thrill the knightly fervour of his forefathers came upon him, and he saw a sweet and golden lady set far above him upon a throne.",m
689,"Her clear eyes gazed afar, serene and untroubled.",m
690,"She sat wrapped in a sort of virginal austerity, unaware of the base passions of men.",m
691,The other women whom Ste.,m
692,"Marie had, as he was pleased to term it, loved, had certainly come at least halfway to meet him, and some of them had come a good deal farther than that.",m
693,"He could not, by the wildest flight of imagination, conceive this girl doing anything of that sort.",m
694,"She was to be won by trial and high endeavour, by prayer and self-purification, not captured by a warm eye glance, a whispered word, a laughing kiss.",m
695,"In fancy he looked from the crowding cohorts of these others to that still sweet figure set on high, wrapt in virginal pride, calm in her serene perfection, and his soul abased itself before her.",m
696,He knelt in an awed and worshipful adoration.,m
697,"So, before quest or tournament or battle, must those elder Ste.",m
698,Maries--Ste.,m
699,"Maries of Mont-les-Roses--have knelt, each knight at the feet of his lady, each knightly soul aglow with the chaste ardour of chivalry.",m
700,"The man's hands tightened upon the parapet of the bridge, he lifted his face again to the shining stars whereamong, as his fancy had it, she sat enthroned.",m
701,"Exultingly he felt under his feet the rungs of the ladder, and in the darkness he swore a great oath to have done for ever with blindness and grovelling, to climb and climb, forever to climb, until at last he should stand where she was--cleansed and made worthy by long endeavour--at last meet her eyes and touch her hand.",m
702,"It was a fine and chivalric frenzy, and Ste.",m
703,"Marie was passionately in earnest about it, but his guardian angel, indeed Fate herself, must have laughed a little in the dark, knowing what manner of man he was in less exalted hours.",m
704,It was an odd freak of memory that at last recalled him to earth.,m
705,"Every man knows that when a strong and, for the moment, unavailing effort has been made to recall something lost to mind, the memory, in some mysterious fashion, goes on working long after the attention has been elsewhere diverted, and sometimes hours afterwards, or even days, produces quite suddenly and inappropriately the lost article.",m
706,Ste.,m
707,"Marie had turned with a little sigh to take up once more his walk across the Pont des Invalides, when seemingly from nowhere, and certainly by no conscious effort, a name flashed into his mind.",m
708,"He said it aloud----  ""O'Hara!",m
709,O'Hara.,m
710,"That tall thin chap's name was O'Hara, by Jove!",m
711,"It wasn't Powers at all.""",m
712,He laughed a little as he remembered how very positive Captain Stewart had been.,m
713,"And then he frowned, thinking that the mistake was an odd one since Stewart had evidently known a good deal about this adventurer.",m
714,"Captain Stewart though, Ste.",m
715,"Marie reflected, was exactly the sort to be very sure he was right about things.",m
716,He had just the neat and precise and semi-scholarly personality of the man who always knows.,m
717,So Ste.,m
718,"Marie dismissed the matter with another brief laugh, but a cognate matter was less easy to dismiss.",m
719,"The name brought with it a face, a dark and splendid face with tragic eyes that called.",m
720,"He walked a long way thinking about them, and wondering.",m
721,The eyes haunted him.,m
722,It will have been reasonably evident that Ste.,m
723,Marie was a fanciful and imaginative soul.,m
724,"He needed but a chance word, the sight of a face in a crowd, the glance of an eye, to begin story building, and he would go on for hours about it and work himself up to quite a passion with his imaginings.",m
725,He should have been a writer of fiction.,m
726,He began forthwith to construct romances about this lady of the motor-car.,m
727,"He wondered why she should have been with the shady Irishman--if Irishman he was--O'Hara, and with some anxiety he wondered what the two were to each other.",m
728,"Captain Stewart's little cynical jest came to his mind, and he was conscious of a sudden desire to kick Miss Benham's middle-aged uncle.",m
729,The eyes haunted him.,m
730,What was it they suffered?,m
731,Out of what misery did they call?--and for what?,m
732,"He walked all the long way home to his little flat overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens, haunted by those eyes.",m
733,"As he climbed his stair it suddenly occurred to him that they had quite driven out of his mind the image of his beautiful lady who sat amongst the stars, and the realisation came to him with a shock.                                                                  It was Miss Benham's custom upon returning home at night from dinner parties or other entertainments to look in for a few minutes on her grandfather before going to bed.",m
734,"The old gentleman, like most elderly people, slept lightly, and often sat up in bed very late into the night reading or playing piquet with his valet.",m
735,"He suffered hideously at times from the malady which was killing him by degrees, but when he was free from pain the enormous recuperative power, which he had preserved to his eighty-six years, left him almost as vigorous and clear-minded as if he had never been ill at all.",m
736,"Hartley's description of him had not been altogether a bad one--""a quaint old beggar ... a great quantity of white hair and an enormous square white beard and the fiercest eyes I ever saw----""  He was a rather ""quaint old beggar"" indeed!",m
737,"He had let his thick white hair grow long, and it hung down over his brows in unparted locks as the ancient Greeks wore their hair.",m
738,"He had very shaggy eyebrows, and the deep-set eyes under them gleamed from the shadow with a fierceness which was rather deceptive but none the less intimidating.",m
739,"He had a great beak of a nose, but the mouth below could not be seen.",m
740,It was hidden by the moustache and the enormous square beard.,m
741,"His face was colourless, almost as white as hair and beard: there seemed to be no shadow or tint anywhere except the cavernous recesses from which the man's eyes gleamed and sparkled.",m
742,"Altogether he was certainly ""a quaint old beggar.""",m
743,"He had, during the day and evening, a good many visitors, for the old gentleman's mind was as alert as it ever had been, and important men thought him worth consulting.",m
744,"The names which the admirable valet, Peters, announced from time to time were names which meant a great deal in the official and diplomatic world of the day.",m
745,But if old David felt flattered over the unusual fashion in which the great of the earth continued to come to him he never betrayed it.,m
746,Indeed it is quite probable that this view of the situation never once occurred to him.,m
747,"He had been thrown with the great of the earth for more than half a century, and he had learnt to take it as a matter of course.",m
748,"On her return from the Marquise de Saulnes' dinner party Miss Benham went at once to her grandfather's wing of the house, which had its own street entrance, and knocked lightly at his door.",m
749,"She asked the admirable Peters, who opened to her--  ""Is he awake?""",m
750,"And being assured that he was, went into the vast chamber, dropping her cloak on a chair as she entered.",m
751,David Stewart was sitting up in his monumental bed behind a sort of invalid's table which stretched across his knees without touching them.,m
752,"He wore over his night-clothes a Chinese Mandarin's jacket of old red satin, wadded with down, and very gorgeously embroidered with the cloud and bat designs and with large round panels of the Imperial five-clawed dragon in gold.",m
753,"He had a number of these jackets, they seemed to be his one vanity in things external, and they were so made that they could be slipped about him without disturbing him in his bed, since they hung down only to the waist or thereabouts.",m
754,"They kept the upper part of his body, which was not covered by the bedclothes, warm, and they certainly made him a very impressive figure.",m
755,"He said--  ""Ah, Helen!",m
756,Come in!,m
757,Come in!,m
758,"Sit down on the bed there and tell me what you have been doing!""",m
759,"He pushed aside the pack of cards which was spread out on the invalid's table before him, and with great care counted a sum of money in francs and half-francs and nickel twenty-five centime pieces.",m
760,"""I've won seven francs fifty from Peters to-night,"" he said, chuckling gently.",m
761,"""That is a very good evening indeed.",m
762,Very good.,m
763,"Where have you been, and who were there?""",m
764,"""A dinner party at the de Saulnes',"" said Miss Benham, making herself comfortable on the side of the great bed.",m
765,"""It's a very pleasant place.",m
766,"Marian is, of course, a dear, and they're quite English and unceremonious.",m
767,"You can talk to your neighbour at dinner instead of addressing the house from a platform, as it were.",m
768,"French dinner parties make me nervous.""",m
769,Old David gave a little growling laugh.,m
770,"""French dinner parties at least keep people up to the mark in the art of conversation,"" said he.",m
771,"""But that is a lost art anyhow, nowadays, so I suppose one might as well be quite informal and have done with it.",m
772,"Who were there?""",m
773,"""Oh, well--"" she considered, ""no one, I should think, who would interest you.",m
774,Rather an indifferent set.,m
775,Pleasant people but not inspiring.,m
776,The Marquis had some young relative or connexion who was quite odious and made the most surprising noises over his food.,m
777,I met a new man whom I think I am going to like very much indeed.,m
778,"He wouldn't interest you because he doesn't mean anything in particular--and, of course, he oughtn't to interest me for the same reason.",m
779,"He's just an idle pleasant young man, but--he has great charm.",m
780,Very great charm.,m
781,His name is Ste.,m
782,Marie.,m
783,"Baron de Vries seems very fond of him, which surprised me rather.""",m
784,"""Ste.",m
785,"Marie!"" exclaimed the old gentleman in obvious astonishment.",m
786,"""Ste.",m
787,"Marie de Mont Perdu?""",m
788,"""Yes,"" she said.",m
789,"""Yes, that is the name, I believe.",m
790,You know him then?,m
791,"I wonder he didn't mention it.""",m
792,"""I knew his father,"" said old David.",m
793,"""And his grandfather, for that matter.",m
794,"They're Gascon, I think, or Bearnais, but this boy's mother will have been Irish, unless his father married again.",m
795,"""So you've been meeting a Ste.",m
796,"Marie, have you?",m
797,"And finding that he has great charm?""",m
798,"The old gentleman broke into one of his growling laughs, and reached for a long black cigar which he lighted, eyeing his granddaughter the while over the flaring match.",m
799,"""Well,"" he said, when the cigar was drawing, ""they all have had charm.",m
800,I should think there has never been a Ste.,m
801,Marie without it.,m
802,"They're a sort of embodiment of romance, that family.",m
803,This boy's great-grandfather lost his life defending a castle against a horde of peasants in 1799.,m
804,"His grandfather was killed in the French campaign in Mexico in '39--at Vera Cruz, it was, I think; and his father died in a filibustering expedition ten years ago.",m
805,I wonder what will become of the last Ste.,m
806,"Marie?""",m
807,Old David's eyes suddenly sharpened.,m
808,"""You're not going to fall in love with Ste.",m
809,"Marie and marry him, are you?"" he demanded.",m
810,"Miss Benham gave a little angry laugh, but her grandfather saw the colour rise in her cheeks for all that.",m
811,"""Certainly not!"" she said with great decision.",m
812,"""What an absurd idea!",m
813,"Because I meet a man at a dinner party and say I like him, must I marry him to-morrow?",m
814,"I meet a great many men at dinners and things, and a few of them I like.",m
815,"Heavens!""",m
816,"""'Methinks the lady doth protest too much,'"" muttered old David into his huge beard.",m
817,"""I beg your pardon?"" asked Miss Benham politely.",m
818,"But he shook his head, still growling inarticulately, and began to draw enormous clouds of smoke from the long black cigar.",m
819,"After a time he took the cigar once more from his lips and looked thoughtfully at his granddaughter where she sat on the edge of the vast bed, upright and beautiful, perfect in the most meticulous detail.",m
820,"Most women when they return from a long evening out, look more or less the worse for it.",m
821,"Deadened eyes, pale cheeks, loosened coiffure tell their inevitable tale.",m
822,Miss Benham looked as if she had just come from the hands of a very excellent maid.,m
823,She looked as freshly soignee as she might have looked at eight that evening instead of at one.,m
824,"Not a wave of her perfectly undulated hair was loosened or displaced, not a fold of the lace at her breast had departed from its perfect arrangement.",m
825,"""It is odd,"" said old David Stewart, ""you taking a fancy to young Ste.",m
826,Marie.,m
827,"Of course it's natural too in a way, because you are complete opposites, I should think--that is, if this lad is like the rest of his race.",m
828,"What I mean is, that merely attractive young men don't as a rule attract you.""",m
829,"""Well, no,"" she admitted, ""they don't usually.",m
830,"Men with brains attract me most, I think--men who are making civilisation, men who are ruling the world or at least doing important things for it.",m
831,"That's your fault, you know.",m
832,"You taught me that.""",m
833,The old gentleman laughed.,m
834,"""Possibly,"" said he.",m
835,"""Possibly.",m
836,Anyhow that is the sort of men you like and they like you.,m
837,"You're by no means a fool, Helen.",m
838,"In fact, you're a woman with brains.",m
839,"You could wield great influence married to the proper sort of man.""",m
840,"""But not to M. Ste.",m
841,"Marie,"" she suggested, smiling across at him.",m
842,"""Well, no,"" he said.",m
843,"""No, not to Ste.",m
844,Marie.,m
845,It would be a mistake to marry Ste.,m
846,Marie--if he is what the rest of his house have been.,m
847,The Ste.,m
848,Maries live a life compounded of romance and imagination and emotion.,m
849,"You're not emotional.""",m
850,"""No,"" said Miss Benham slowly and thoughtfully.",m
851,It was as if the idea were new to her.,m
852,"""No, I'm not, I suppose.",m
853,"No.  Certainly not.""",m
854,"""As a matter of fact,"" said old David, ""you're by nature rather cold.",m
855,I'm not sure it isn't a good thing.,m
856,"Emotional people, I observe, are usually in hot water of some sort.",m
857,When you marry you're very likely to choose with a great deal of care and some wisdom.,m
858,And you're also likely to have what is called a career.,m
859,"I repeat that you could wield great influence in the proper environment.""",m
860,The girl frowned across at her grandfather reflectively.,m
861,"""Do you mean by that,"" she asked after a little silence, ""do you mean that you think I am likely to be moved by sheer ambition and nothing else in arranging my life?",m
862,"I've never thought of myself as a very ambitious person.""",m
863,"""Let us substitute for ambition, common sense,"" said old David.",m
864,"""I think you have a great deal of common sense for a woman--and so young a woman.",m
865,"How old are you, by the way?",m
866,Twenty-two?,m
867,"Yes, to be sure.",m
868,I think you have great common sense and appreciation of values.,m
869,And I think you're singularly free of the emotionalism that so often plays hob with them all.,m
870,"People with common sense fall in love in the right places.""",m
871,"""I don't quite like the sound of it,"" said Miss Benham.",m
872,"""Perhaps I am rather ambitious--I don't know.",m
873,"Yes, perhaps.",m
874,I should like to play some part in the world.,m
875,I don't deny that.,m
876,But--am I as cold as you say?,m
877,I doubt it very much.,m
878,"I doubt that.""",m
879,"""You're twenty-two,"" said her grandfather.",m
880,"""And you have seen a good deal of society in several capitals.",m
881,"Have you ever fallen in love?""",m
882,"Oddly, the face of Ste.",m
883,Marie came before Miss Benham's eyes as if she had summoned it there.,m
884,"But she frowned a little and shook her head, saying--  ""No, I can't say that I have.",m
885,But that means nothing.,m
886,There's plenty of time for that.,m
887,"""And you know,"" she said after a pause, ""you know I'm rather sure I could fall in love--pretty hard.",m
888,I'm sure of that.,m
889,Perhaps I have been waiting.,m
890,"Who knows?""",m
891,"""Ay, who knows?"" said David.",m
892,"He seemed all at once to lose interest in the subject, as old people often do without apparent reason, for he remained silent for a long time, puffing at the long black cigar or rolling it absently between his fingers.",m
893,After awhile he laid it down in a metal dish which stood at his elbow and folded his lean hands before him over the invalid's table.,m
894,"He was still so long that at last his granddaughter thought he had fallen asleep, and she began to rise from her seat, taking care to make no noise, but at that the old man stirred, and put out his hand once more for the cigar.",m
895,"""Was young Richard Hartley at your dinner party?"" he asked.",m
896,"And she said--  ""Yes.",m
897,"Oh, yes, he was there.",m
898,He and M. Ste.,m
899,"Marie came together, I believe.",m
900,"They are very close friends.""",m
901,"""Another idler,"" growled old David.",m
902,"""The fellow's a man of parts--and a man of family.",m
903,What's he idling about here for?,m
904,"Why isn't he in Parliament where he belongs?""",m
905,"""Well,"" said the girl, ""I should think it is because he is too much a man of family--as you put it.",m
906,"You see, he'll succeed his cousin, Lord Risdale, before very long, and then all his work would have been for nothing, because he'll have to take his seat in the Lords.",m
907,"Lord Risdale is unmarried, you know, and a hopeless invalid.",m
908,He may die any day.,m
909,I think I sympathise with poor Mr. Hartley.,m
910,It would be a pity to build up a career for one's self in the lower House and then suddenly in the midst of it have to give it all up.,m
911,"The situation is rather paralysing to endeavour, isn't it?""",m
912,"""Yes, I dare say,"" said old David absently.",m
913,He looked up sharply.,m
914,"""Young Hartley doesn't come here as much as he used to do.""",m
915,"""No,"" said Miss Benham, ""he doesn't.""",m
916,She gave a little laugh.,m
917,"""To avoid cross-examination,"" she said, ""I may as well admit that he asked me to marry him and I had to refuse.",m
918,"I'm sorry, because I like him very much indeed.""",m
919,Old David made an inarticulate sound which may have been meant to express surprise--or almost anything else.,m
920,He had not a great range of expression.,m
921,"""I don't want,"" said he, ""to seem to have gone daft on the subject of marriage, and I see no reason why you should be in any haste about it--certainly, I should hate to lose you, my child, but--Hartley, as the next Lord Risdale, is undoubtedly a good match.",m
922,"And you say you like him.""",m
923,"The girl looked up with a sort of defiance, and her face was a little flushed.",m
924,"""I don't love him,"" she said.",m
925,"""I like him immensely but I don't love him, and after all--well, you say I'm cold and I admit I'm more or less ambitious, but, after all--well, I just don't quite love him.",m
926,"I want to love the man I marry.""",m
927,Old David Stewart held up his black cigar and gazed thoughtfully at the smoke which streamed thin and blue and veil-like from its lighted end.,m
928,"""Love!"" he said in a reflective tone.",m
929,"""Love.""",m
930,"He repeated the word two or three times slowly, and he stirred a little in his bed.",m
931,"""I have forgotten what it is,"" said he.",m
932,"""I expect I must be very old.",m
933,I have forgotten what love--that sort of love--is like.,m
934,It seems very far away to me and rather unimportant.,m
935,"But I remember that I thought it important enough once, a century or two ago.",m
936,"Do you know, it strikes me as rather odd that I have forgotten what love is like.",m
937,"It strikes me as rather pathetic.""",m
938,He gave a sort of uncouth grimace and stuck the black cigar once more into his mouth.,m
939,"""Egad!"" said he, mumbling indistinctly over the cigar, ""how foolish love seems when you look back at it across fifty or sixty years!""",m
940,"Miss Benham rose to her feet smiling, and she came and stood near where the old man lay propped up against his pillows.",m
941,"She touched his cheek with her cool hand, and old David put up one of his own hands and patted it.",m
942,"""I'm going to bed now,"" said she.",m
943,"""I've sat here talking too long.",m
944,"You ought to be asleep and so ought I.""",m
945,"""Perhaps!",m
946,"Perhaps!"" the old man said.",m
947,"""I don't feel sleepy, though.",m
948,"I dare say I shall read a little.""",m
949,He held her hand in his and looked up at her.,m
950,"""I've been talking a great deal of nonsense about marriage,"" said he.",m
951,"""Put it out of your head!",m
952,It's all nonsense.,m
953,I don't want you to marry for a long time.,m
954,"I don't want to lose you.""",m
955,His face twisted a little quite suddenly.,m
956,"""You're precious near all I have left, now,"" he said.",m
957,"The girl did not answer at once, for it seemed to her that there was nothing to say.",m
958,"She knew that her grandfather was thinking of the lost boy, and she knew what a bitter blow the thing had been to him.",m
959,She often thought that it would kill him before his old malady could run its course.,m
960,"But after a moment she said very gently--  ""We won't give up hope.",m
961,We'll never give up hope.,m
962,Think! he might come home to morrow.,m
963,"Who knows?""",m
964,"""If he has stayed away of his own accord,"" cried out old David Stewart in a loud voice, ""I'll never forgive him--not if he comes to me to-morrow on his knees!",m
965,"Not even if he comes to me on his knees!""",m
966,"The girl bent over her grandfather, saying: ""Hush! hush!",m
967,"You mustn't excite yourself.""",m
968,But old David's grey face was working and his eyes gleamed from their cavernous shadows with a savage fire.,m
969,"""If the boy is staying away out of spite,"" he repeated, ""he need never come back to me.",m
970,"I won't forgive him.""",m
971,"He beat his unemployed hand upon the table before him, and the things which lay there jumped and danced.",m
972,"""And if he waits until I'm dead and then comes back,"" said he, ""he'll find he has made a mistake--a great mistake.",m
973,He'll find a surprise in store for him.,m
974,I can tell you that.,m
975,"I won't tell you what I have done, but it will be a disagreeable surprise for Master Arthur.",m
976,"You may be sure.""",m
977,"The old gentleman fell to frowning and muttering in his choleric fashion, but the fierce glitter began to go out of his eyes, and his hands ceased to tremble and clutch at the things before him.",m
978,The girl was silent because again there seemed to her to be nothing that she could say.,m
979,"She longed very much to plead her brother's cause, but she was sure that would only excite her grandfather, and he was growing quieter after his burst of anger.",m
980,She bent down over him and kissed his cheek.,m
981,"""Try to go to sleep!"" she said.",m
982,"""And don't torture yourself with thinking about all this.",m
983,I'm as sure that poor Arthur is not staying away out of spite as if he were myself.,m
984,"He's foolish and headstrong, but he's not spiteful, dear.",m
985,Try to believe that!,m
986,And now I'm really going.,m
987,"Good-night!""",m
988,She kissed him again and slipped out of the room.,m
989,"And as she closed the door she heard her grandfather pull the bell-cord which hung beside him and summon the excellent Peters from the room beyond.                                                    Miss Benham stood at one of the long drawing-room windows of the house in the Rue de l'Universite and looked out between the curtains upon the rather grimy little garden, where a few not very prosperous cypresses and chestnuts stood guard over the rows of lilac shrubs and the box-bordered flower-beds and the usual moss-stained fountain.",m
990,"She was thinking of the events of the past month, the month which had elapsed since the evening of the de Saulnes' dinner party.",m
991,"They were not at all startling events; in a practical sense there were no events at all, only a quiet sequence of affairs which was about as inevitable as the night upon the day--the day upon the night again.",m
992,"In a word this girl, who had considered herself very strong and very much the mistress of her feelings, found, for the first time in her life, that her strength was as nothing at all against the potent charm and magnetism of a man who had almost none of the qualities she chiefly admired in men.",m
993,"During the month's time she had passed from a phase of angry self-scorn through a period of bewilderment not unmixed with fear, and from that she had come into an unknown world, a land very strange to her, where old standards and judgments seemed to be valueless--a place seemingly ruled altogether by new emotions, sweet and thrilling or full of vague terrors as her mood veered here or there.",m
994,"That sublimated form of guesswork which is called ""woman's intuition"" told her that Ste.",m
995,"Marie would come to her on this afternoon, and that something in the nature of a crisis would have to be faced.",m
996,"It can be proved even by poor masculine mathematics that guesswork, like other gambling ventures, is bound to succeed about half the time, and it succeeded on this occasion.",m
997,Even as Miss Benham stood at the window looking out through the curtains Monsieur Ste.,m
998,Marie was announced from the doorway.,m
999,"She turned to meet him with a little frown of determination, for in his absence she was often very strong indeed, and sometimes she made up and rehearsed little speeches of great dignity and decision, in which she told him that he was attempting a quite hopeless thing, and, as a well-wishing friend, advised him to go away and attempt it no longer.",m
1000,But as Ste.,m
1001,"Marie came quickly across the room towards her the little frown wavered and at last fled from her face, and another look came there.",m
1002,It was always so.,m
1003,The man's bodily presence exerted an absolute spell over her.,m
1004,"""I have been sitting with your grandfather for half an hour,"" Ste.",m
1005,"Marie said, and she said--  ""Oh, I'm glad!",m
1006,I'm very glad.,m
1007,You always cheer him up.,m
1008,"He hasn't been too cheerful, or too well of late.""",m
1009,She unnecessarily twisted a chair about and after a moment sat down in it.,m
1010,And she gave a little laugh.,m
1011,"""This friendship which has grown up between my grandfather and you,"" said she, ""I don't understand it at all.",m
1012,"Of course, he knew your father and all that, but you two seem such very different types, I shouldn't think you would amuse each other at all.",m
1013,"There's Mr. Hartley, for example, I should expect my grandfather to like him very much better than you, but he doesn't--though I fancy he approves of him much more.""",m
1014,"She laughed again, but a different laugh, and when he heard it Ste.",m
1015,Marie's eyes gleamed a little and his hands moved beside him.,m
1016,"""I expect,"" said she, ""I expect, you know, that he just likes you, without stopping to think why--as everybody else does.",m
1017,I fancy it's just that.,m
1018,"What do you think?""",m
1019,"""Oh, I?"" said the man.",m
1020,"""I--how should I know?",m
1021,I know it's a great privilege to be allowed to see him--such a man as that.,m
1022,And I know we get on wonderfully well.,m
1023,He doesn't condescend as most old men do who have led important lives.,m
1024,We just talk as two men in a club might talk.,m
1025,And I tell him stories and make him laugh.,m
1026,"Oh yes, we get on wonderfully well.""",m
1027,"""Oh!"" said she.",m
1028,"""I've often wondered what you talk about.",m
1029,"What did you talk about to-day?""",m
1030,Ste.,m
1031,Marie turned abruptly away from her and went across to one of the windows--the window where she had stood earlier looking out upon the dingy garden.,m
1032,"She saw him stand there, with his back turned, the head a little bent, the hands twisting together behind him, and a sudden fit of nervous shivering wrung her.",m
1033,"Every woman knows when a certain thing is going to be said to her, and usually she is prepared for it, though usually also she says she is not.",m
1034,"Miss Benham knew what was coming now, and she was frightened--not of Ste.",m
1035,"Marie, but of herself.",m
1036,"It meant so very much to her, more than to most women at such a time.",m
1037,"It meant, if she said yes to him, the surrender of almost all the things she had cared for and hoped for.",m
1038,It meant the giving up of that career which old David Stewart had dwelt upon a month ago.,m
1039,Ste.,m
1040,Marie turned back into the room.,m
1041,"He came a little way towards where the girl sat and halted, and she could see that he was very pale.",m
1042,"A sort of critical second self noticed that he was pale, and was surprised, because, although men's faces often turn red, they seldom turn noticeably pale except in very great nervous crises--or in works of fiction; while women on the contrary may turn red and white twenty times a day, and no harm done.",m
1043,"He raised his hands a little way from his sides in the beginning of a gesture, but they dropped again as if there were no strength in them.",m
1044,"""I--told him,"" said Ste.",m
1045,"Marie in a flat voice, ""I told your grandfather that I--loved you more than anything in this world or in the next.",m
1046,I told him that my love for you had made another being of me--a new being.,m
1047,"I told him that I wanted to come to you and to kneel at your feet and to ask you if you could give me just a little, little hope--something to live for--a light to climb towards.",m
1048,"That is what we talked about, your grandfather and I.""",m
1049,"""Ste.",m
1050,Marie!,m
1051,Ste.,m
1052,"Marie!"" said the girl in a half whisper.",m
1053,"""What did my grandfather say to you?"" she asked after a silence.",m
1054,Ste.,m
1055,Marie looked away.,m
1056,"""I cannot tell you,"" he said.",m
1057,"""He--was not quite sympathetic.""",m
1058,The girl gave a little cry.,m
1059,"""Tell me what he said!"" she demanded.",m
1060,"""I must know what he said.""",m
1061,"The man's eyes pleaded with her, but she held him with her gaze and in the end he gave in.",m
1062,"""He said I was a damned fool,"" said Ste.",m
1063,Marie.,m
1064,"And the girl, after an instant of staring, broke into a little fit of nervous overwrought laughter, and covered her face with her hands.",m
1065,"He threw himself upon his knees before her, and her laughter died away.",m
1066,An Englishman or an American cannot do that.,m
1067,"Richard Hartley, for example, would have looked like an idiot upon his knees and he would have felt it.",m
1068,But it did not seem extravagant with Ste.,m
1069,Marie.,m
1070,It became him.,m
1071,"""Listen! listen!"" he cried to her, but the girl checked him before he could go on.",m
1072,She dropped her hands from her face and she bent a little forward over the man as he knelt there.,m
1073,"She put out her hands and took his head for a swift instant between them, looking down into his eyes.",m
1074,At the touch a sudden wave of tenderness swept her--almost an engulfing wave--almost it overwhelmed her and bore her away from the land she knew.,m
1075,And so when she spoke her voice was not quite steady.,m
1076,"She said--  ""Ah, dear Ste.",m
1077,Marie!,m
1078,I cannot pretend to be cold towards you.,m
1079,"You have laid a spell upon me, Ste.",m
1080,Marie.,m
1081,"You enchant us all somehow, don't you?",m
1082,I suppose I'm not as different from the others as I thought I was.,m
1083,"""And yet,"" she said, ""he was right, you know.",m
1084,My grandfather was right.,m
1085,"No, let me talk, now!",m
1086,I must talk for a little.,m
1087,I must try to tell you how it is with me--try somehow to find a way.,m
1088,He was right.,m
1089,"He meant that you and I were utterly unsuited to each other, and so, in calm moments, I know we are.",m
1090,I know that well enough.,m
1091,When you're not with me I feel very sure about it.,m
1092,I think of a thousand excellent reasons why you and I ought to be no more to each other than friends.,m
1093,"Do you know, I think my grandfather is a little uncanny.",m
1094,I think he has prophetic powers.,m
1095,They say very old people often have.,m
1096,He and I talked about you when I came home from that dinner party at the de Saulnes' a month ago--the dinner party where you and I first met.,m
1097,"I told him that I had met a man whom I liked very much--a man with great charm--and, though I must have said the same sort of thing to him before about other men, he was quite oddly disturbed, and talked for a long time about it, about the sort of man I ought to marry and the sort I ought not to marry.",m
1098,It was unusual for him.,m
1099,He seldom says anything of that kind.,m
1100,"Yes, he is right.",m
1101,"You see, I'm ambitious in a particular way.",m
1102,If I marry at all I ought to marry a man who is working hard in politics or in something of that kind.,m
1103,I could help him.,m
1104,"We could do a great deal together.""",m
1105,"""I could go into politics!"" cried Ste.",m
1106,"Marie, but she shook her head, smiling down upon him.",m
1107,"""No, not you, my dear.",m
1108,Politics least of all.,m
1109,"You could be a soldier, if you chose.",m
1110,You could fight as your father and your grandfather and the others of your house have done.,m
1111,You could lead a forlorn hope in the field.,m
1112,You could suffer and starve and go on fighting.,m
1113,"You could die splendidly but--politics, no!",m
1114,That wants a tougher shell than you have.,m
1115,"""And a soldier's wife!",m
1116,"Of what use to him is she?""",m
1117,Ste.,m
1118,Marie's face was very grave.,m
1119,He looked up to her smiling.,m
1120,"""Do you set ambition before love, my queen?"" he asked, and she did not answer him at once.",m
1121,"She looked into his eyes, and she was as grave as he.",m
1122,"""Is love all?"" she said at last.",m
1123,"""Is love all?",m
1124,Ought one to think of nothing but love when one is settling one's life for ever?,m
1125,"""I wonder?",m
1126,"""I look about me, Ste.",m
1127,"Marie,"" she said, ""and in the lives of my friends--the people who seem to me to be most worth while--the people who are making the world's history for good or ill, and it seems to me that in their lives love has the second place--or the third.",m
1128,I wonder if one has the right to set it first.,m
1129,"""There is, of course,"" she said, ""the merely domestic type of woman--the woman who has no thought and no interest beyond her home.",m
1130,I am not that type of woman.,m
1131,Perhaps I wish I were.,m
1132,Certainly they are the happiest.,m
1133,"But I was brought up among--well, among important people--men of my grandfather's kind.",m
1134,All my training has been towards that life.,m
1135,"Have I the right, I wonder, to give it all up?""",m
1136,The man stirred at her feet and she put out her hands to him quickly.,m
1137,"""Do I seem brutal?"" she cried.",m
1138,"""Oh, I don't want to be!",m
1139,Do I seem very ungenerous and wrapped up in my own side of the thing?,m
1140,I don't mean to be that but--I'm not sure.,m
1141,I expect it's that.,m
1142,"I'm not sure, and I think I'm a little frightened.""",m
1143,She gave him a brief anxious smile that was not without its tenderness.,m
1144,"""I'm so sure,"" she said, ""when I'm away from you.",m
1145,"But when you're here--oh, I forget all I've thought of.",m
1146,"""You lay your spell upon me.""",m
1147,Ste.,m
1148,Marie gave a little wordless cry of joy.,m
1149,He caught her two hands in his and held them against his lips.,m
1150,Again that great wave of tenderness swept her--almost engulfing.,m
1151,"But when it had ebbed she sank back once more in her chair, and she withdrew her hands from his clasp.",m
1152,"""You make me forget too much,"" she said.",m
1153,"""I think you make me forget everything that I ought to remember.",m
1154,"Oh, Ste.",m
1155,"Marie, have I any right to think of love and happiness while this terrible mystery is upon us?",m
1156,While we don't know whether poor Arthur is alive or dead?,m
1157,You've seen what it has brought my grandfather to.,m
1158,It is killing him.,m
1159,He has been much worse in the last fortnight.,m
1160,And my mother is hardly a ghost of herself in these days.,m
1161,"Ah, it is brutal of me to think of my own affairs--to dream of happiness at such a time.""",m
1162,She smiled across at him very sadly.,m
1163,"""You see what you have brought me to!"" she said.",m
1164,Ste.,m
1165,Marie rose to his feet.,m
1166,"If Miss Benham, absorbed in that warfare which raged within her, had momentarily forgotten the cloud of sorrow under which her household lay, so much the more had he, to whom the sorrow was less intimate, forgotten it.",m
1167,"But he was ever swift to sympathy, Ste.",m
1168,"Marie, as quick as a woman and as tender.",m
1169,He could not thrust his love upon the girl at such a time as this.,m
1170,He turned a little away from her and so remained for a moment.,m
1171,When he faced about again the flush had gone from his cheeks and the fire from his eyes.,m
1172,Only tenderness was left there.,m
1173,"""There has been no news at all this week?"" he asked, and the girl shook her head.",m
1174,"""None!",m
1175,None!,m
1176,"Shall we ever have news of him, I wonder?",m
1177,Must we go on always and never know?,m
1178,It seems to me almost incredible that any one could disappear so completely.,m
1179,"And yet, I dare say, many people have done it before and have been as carefully sought for.",m
1180,If only I could believe that he is alive!,m
1181,"If only I could believe that!""",m
1182,"""I believe it,"" said Ste.",m
1183,Marie.,m
1184,"""Ah,"" she said, ""you say that to cheer me.",m
1185,"You have no reason to offer.""",m
1186,"""Dead bodies very seldom disappear completely,"" said he.",m
1187,"""If your brother died anywhere there would be a record of the death.",m
1188,"If he were accidentally killed there would be a record of that too, and, of course, you are having all such records constantly searched?""",m
1189,"""Oh yes,"" she said.",m
1190,"""Yes, of course.",m
1191,"At least, I suppose so.",m
1192,My uncle has been directing the search.,m
1193,"Of course he would take an obvious precaution like that.""",m
1194,"""Naturally,"" said Ste.",m
1195,Marie.,m
1196,"""Your uncle, I should say, is an unusually careful man.""",m
1197,He paused a moment to smile.,m
1198,"""He makes his little mistakes, though.",m
1199,I told you about that man O'Hara and about how sure Captain Stewart was that the name was Powers.,m
1200,"Do you know----""  Ste.",m
1201,"Marie had been walking up and down the room, but he halted to face her.",m
1202,"""Do you know, I have a very strong feeling that if one could find this man O'Hara one would learn something about what became of your brother?",m
1203,"I have no reason for thinking that, but I feel it.""",m
1204,"""Oh,"" said the girl doubtfully, ""I hardly think that could be so.",m
1205,"What motive could the man have for harming my brother?""",m
1206,"""None,"" said Ste.",m
1207,Marie;,m
1208,"""but he might have an excellent motive for hiding him away--kidnapping him.",m
1209,Is that the word?,m
1210,"Yes, I know, you're going to say that no demand has been made for money, and that is where my argument--if I can call it an argument--is weak.",m
1211,But the fellow may be biding his time.,m
1212,"Anyhow, I should like to have five minutes alone with him.",m
1213,"""I'll tell you another thing.",m
1214,"It's a trifle and it may be of no consequence, but I add it to my vague and--if you like--foolish feeling and make something out of it.",m
1215,"I happened some days ago to meet at the Cafe de Paris a man who, I knew, used to know this O'Hara.",m
1216,"He was not, I think, a friend of his at all, but an acquaintance.",m
1217,"I asked him what had become of O'Hara, saying that I hadn't seen him for some weeks.",m
1218,"Well, this man said O'Hara had gone away somewhere a couple of months ago.",m
1219,"He didn't seem at all surprised, for it appears the Irishman--if he is an Irishman--is decidedly a haphazard sort of person, here to-day, gone to-morrow.",m
1220,"No, the man wasn't surprised, but he was rather angry, because he said O'Hara owed him some money.",m
1221,"I said I thought he must be mistaken about the fellow's absence, because I'd seen him in the street within the month--on the evening of our dinner party you remember--but this man was very sure that I had made a mistake.",m
1222,He said that if O'Hara had been in town he was sure to have known it.,m
1223,"""Well, the point is here.",m
1224,Your brother disappears at a certain time.,m
1225,"At the same time this Irish adventurer disappears too, and your brother was known to have frequented the Irishman's company.",m
1226,"It may be only a coincidence, but I can't help feeling that there's something in it.""",m
1227,Miss Benham was sitting up straight in her chair with a little alert frown.,m
1228,"""Have you spoken of this to my uncle?"" she demanded.",m
1229,"""Well--no,"" said Ste.",m
1230,Marie.,m
1231,"""Not the latter part of it; that is, not my having heard of O'Hara's disappearance.",m
1232,"In the first place, I learnt of that only three days ago and I have not seen Captain Stewart since--I rather expected to find him here to-day; and in the second place I was quite sure that he would only laugh.",m
1233,He has laughed at me two or three times for suggesting that this Irishman might know something.,m
1234,"Captain Stewart is--not easy to convince, you know.""",m
1235,"""I know,"" she said, looking away.",m
1236,"""He's always very certain that he's right.",m
1237,"Well, perhaps he is right.",m
1238,"Who knows?""",m
1239,She gave a little sob.,m
1240,"""Oh!"" she cried, ""shall we ever have my brother back?",m
1241,Shall we ever see him again?,m
1242,"It is breaking my heart, Ste.",m
1243,"Marie, and it is killing my grandfather and, I think, my mother too!",m
1244,"Oh, can nothing be done!""",m
1245,Ste.,m
1246,"Marie was walking up and down the floor before her, his hands clasped behind his back.",m
1247,"When she had finished speaking the girl saw him halt beside one of the windows, and, after a moment, she saw his head go up sharply and she heard him give a sudden cry.",m
1248,"She thought he had seen something from the window which had wrung that exclamation from him, and she asked--  ""What is it?""",m
1249,But abruptly the man turned back into the room and came across to where she sat.,m
1250,"It seemed to her that his face had a new look, a very strange exaltation which she had never before seen there.",m
1251,"He said--  ""Listen!",m
1252,"I do not know if anything can be done that has not been done already, but if there is anything I shall do it, you may be sure.""",m
1253,"""You, Ste.",m
1254,"Marie!"" she cried in a sharp voice.",m
1255,"""You?""",m
1256,"""And why not I?"" he demanded.",m
1257,"""Oh, my friend,"" said she, ""you could do nothing.",m
1258,"You wouldn't know where to turn, how to set to work.",m
1259,Remember that a score of men who are skilled in this kind of thing have been searching for two months.,m
1260,"What could you do that they haven't done?""",m
1261,"""I do not know, my queen,"" said Ste.",m
1262,Marie;,m
1263,"""but I shall do what I can.",m
1264,Who knows?,m
1265,Sometimes the fool who rushes in where angels have feared to tread succeeds where they have failed.,m
1266,"""Oh, let me do this!"" he cried out.",m
1267,"""Let me do it, for both our sakes, for yours and for mine.",m
1268,It is for your sake most.,m
1269,I swear that!,m
1270,"It is to set you at peace again, bring back the happiness you have lost.",m
1271,"But it is for my sake too, a little.",m
1272,"It will be a test of me, a trial.",m
1273,"If I can succeed here where so many have failed, if I can bring back your brother to you--or at least, discover what has become of him--I shall be able to come to you with less shame for my--unworthiness.""",m
1274,"He looked down upon her with eager burning eyes, and, after a little, the girl rose to face him.",m
1275,She was very white and she stared at him silently.,m
1276,"""When I came to you to-day,"" he went on, ""I knew that I had nothing to offer you but my faithful love and my life, which has been a life without value.",m
1277,In exchange for that I asked too much.,m
1278,I knew it and you knew it too.,m
1279,"I know well enough what sort of man you ought to marry, and what a brilliant career you could make for yourself in the proper place--what great influence you could wield.",m
1280,But I asked you to give that all up and I hadn't anything to offer in its place--nothing but love.,m
1281,"""My queen, give me a chance now to offer you more!",m
1282,"If I can bring back your brother or news of him, I can come to you without shame and ask you to marry me, because if I can succeed in that you will know that I can succeed in other things.",m
1283,You will be able to trust me.,m
1284,You'll know that I can climb.,m
1285,It shall be a sort of symbol.,m
1286,"Let me go!""",m
1287,The girl broke into a sort of sobbing laughter.,m
1288,"""Oh, divine madman!"" she cried.",m
1289,"""Are you all mad, you Ste.",m
1290,"Maries, that you must be forever leading forlorn hopes?",m
1291,"Oh, how you are, after all, a Ste.",m
1292,Marie!,m
1293,Now at last I know why one cannot but love you.,m
1294,You're the knight of old.,m
1295,You're chivalry come down to us.,m
1296,You're a ghost out of the past when men rode in armour with pure hearts seeking the Great Adventure.,m
1297,"""Oh, my friend,"" she said, ""be wise!",m
1298,Give this up in time.,m
1299,"It is a beautiful thought and I love you for it, but it is madness--yes, yes, a sweet madness, but mad nevertheless!",m
1300,What possible chance would you have of success?,m
1301,And think!,m
1302,Think how failure would hurt you--and me!,m
1303,"You must not do it, Ste.",m
1304,"Marie.""",m
1305,"""Failure will never hurt me, my queen,"" said he;",m
1306,"""because there are no hurts in the grave, and I shall never give over searching until I succeed or until I am dead.""",m
1307,"His face was uplifted, and there was a sort of splendid fervour upon it.",m
1308,It was as if it shone.,m
1309,The girl stared at him dumbly.,m
1310,"She began to realise that the knightly spirit of those gallant long-dead gentlemen was indeed descended upon the last of their house, that he burnt with the same pure fire which had long ago lighted them through quest and adventure, and she was a little afraid with an almost superstitious fear.",m
1311,"She put out her hands upon the man's shoulders and she moved a little closer to him, holding him.",m
1312,"""Oh, madness! madness!"" she said, watching his face.",m
1313,"""Let me do it!"" said Ste.",m
1314,Marie.,m
1315,"And after a silence that seemed to endure for a long time she sighed, shaking her head, and said she--  ""Oh, my friend, there is no strength in me to stop you.",m
1316,"I think we are both a little mad, and I know that you are very mad, but I cannot say no.  You seem to have come out of another century to take up this quest.",m
1317,How can I prevent you?,m
1318,But listen to one thing.,m
1319,"If I accept this sacrifice, if I let you give your time and your strength to this almost hopeless attempt, it must be understood that it is to be within certain limits.",m
1320,I will not accept any indefinite thing.,m
1321,"You may give your efforts to trying to find trace of my brother for a month if you like, or for three months or six, or even a year, but not for more than that.",m
1322,"If he is not found in a year's time we shall know that--we shall know that he is dead, and that--further search is useless.",m
1323,"I cannot say how I----  Oh, Ste.",m
1324,"Marie, Ste.",m
1325,"Marie, this is a proof of you indeed!",m
1326,And I have called you idle!,m
1327,I have said hard things of you.,m
1328,"It is very bitter to me to think that I have said those things.""",m
1329,"""They were true, my queen,"" said he, smiling.",m
1330,"""They were quite true.",m
1331,"It is for me to prove now that they shall be true no longer.""",m
1332,"He took the girl's hand in his rather ceremoniously, and bent his head and kissed it.",m
1333,"As he did so he was aware that she stirred, all at once, uneasily, and when he had raised his head he looked at her in question.",m
1334,"""I thought some one was coming into the room,"" she explained, looking beyond him.",m
1335,"""I thought some one started to come in between the portieres yonder.",m
1336,"It must have been a servant.""",m
1337,"""Then it is understood,"" said Ste.",m
1338,Marie.,m
1339,"""To bring you back your happiness and to prove myself in some way worthy of your love, I am to devote myself with all my effort and all my strength to finding your brother or some trace of him, and until I succeed I will not see your face again, my queen.""",m

1341,"""I will not see you,"" said he, ""until I bring you news of him, or until my year is passed and I have failed utterly.",m
1342,I know what risk I run.,m
1343,"If I fail, I lose you.",m
1344,That is understood too.,m
1345,"But if I succeed----""  ""Then?"" she said, breathing quickly.",m
1346,"""Then?""",m
1347,"""Then,"" said he, ""I shall come to you and I shall feel no shame in asking you to marry me, because then you will know that there is in me some little worthiness, and that in our lives together you need not be buried in obscurity--lost to the world.""",m
1348,"""I cannot find any words to say,"" said she.",m
1349,"""I am feeling just now very humble and very ashamed.",m
1350,It seems that I haven't known you at all.,m
1351,"Oh yes, I am ashamed.""",m
1352,"The girl's face, habitually so cool and composed, was flushed with a beautiful flush, and it had softened and it seemed to quiver between a smile and a tear.",m
1353,"With a swift movement she leant close to him holding by his shoulder, and for an instant her cheek was against his.",m
1354,"She whispered to him--  ""Oh, find him quickly, my dear!",m
1355,"Find him quickly, and come back to me!""",m
1356,Ste.,m
1357,"Marie began to tremble, and she stood away from him.",m
1358,"Once he looked up, but the flush was gone from Miss Benham's cheeks, and she was pale again.",m
1359,She stood with her hands tight clasped over her breast.,m
1360,"So he bowed to her very low, and turned and went out of the room and out of the house.",m
1361,So quickly did he move at this last that a man who had been for some moments standing just outside the portieres of the doorway had barely time to step aside into the shadows of the dim hall.,m
1362,"As it was, Ste.",m
1363,"Marie in a more normal moment must have seen that the man was there, but his eyes were blind and he saw nothing.",m
1364,"He groped for his hat and stick as if the place were a place of gloom, and, because the footman who should have been at the door was in regions unknown, he let himself out and so went away.",m
1365,Then the man who stood apart in the shadows crossed the hall to a small room which was furnished as a library but not often used.,m
1366,He closed the door behind him and went to one of the windows which gave upon the street.,m
1367,"And he stood there for a long time drawing absurd invisible pictures upon the glass with one finger, and staring thoughtfully out into the late June afternoon.                                                      *A BRAVE GENTLEMAN RECEIVES A HURT BUT                       VOLUNTEERS IN A GOOD CAUSE*   When Ste.",m
1368,Marie had gone Miss Benham sat alone in the drawing-room for almost an hour.,m
1369,"She had been stirred that afternoon more deeply than she thought she had ever been stirred before, and she needed time to regain that cool poise, that mental equilibrium which was normal to her and necessary for coherent thought.",m
1370,"She was still in a sort of fever of bewilderment and exaltation, still all aglow with the man's own high fervour; but the second self, which so often sat apart from her and looked on with critical mocking eyes, whispered that to-morrow, the fervour past, the fever cooled, she must see the thing in its truer light--a glorious lunacy born of a moment of enthusiasm.",m
1371,"It was finely romantic of him, this mocking second self whispered to her: picturesque beyond criticism; but, setting aside the practical folly of it, could even the mood last?",m
1372,The girl rose to her feet with an angry exclamation.,m
1373,She found herself intolerable at such times as this.,m
1374,"""If there's a heaven,"" she cried out, ""and by chance I ever go there, I suppose I shall walk sneering through the streets, and saying to myself: 'Oh yes, it's pretty enough, but how absurd and unpractical!'""  She passed before one of the small narrow mirrors which were let into the walls of the room in gilt Louis Seize frames with candles beside them, and she turned and stared at her very beautiful reflection with a resentful wonder.",m
1375,"""Shall I always drag along so far behind him?"" she said.",m
1376,"""Shall I never rise to him, save in the moods of an hour?""",m
1377,"She began suddenly to realise what the man's going away meant--that she might not see him again for weeks, months, even a year.",m
1378,For was it at all likely that he could succeed in what he had undertaken?,m
1379,"""Why did I let him go?"" she cried.",m
1380,"""Oh, fool, fool, to let him go!""",m
1381,But even as she said it she knew that she could not have held him back.,m
1382,"She began to be afraid, not for him, but of herself.",m
1383,He had taught her what it might be to love.,m
1384,"For the first time love's premonitory thrill--promise of unspeakable uncomprehended mysteries--had wrung her, and the echo of that thrill stirred in her yet; but what might not happen in his long absence?",m
1385,She was afraid of that critical and analysing power of mind which she had so long trained to attack all that came to her.,m
1386,What might it not work with the new thing that had come?,m
1387,"To what pitiful shreds might it not be rent while he, who only could renew it, was away?",m
1388,"She looked ahead at the weeks and months to come, and she was terribly afraid.",m
1389,She went out of the room and up to her grandfather's chamber and knocked there.,m
1390,"The admirable Peters who opened to her said that his master had not been very well and was just then asleep, but as they spoke together in low tones the old gentleman cried testily from within--  ""Well?",m
1391,Well?,m
1392,Who's there?,m
1393,Who wants to see me?,m
1394,"Who is it?""",m
1395,"Miss Benham went into the dim shaded room, and when old David saw who it was he sank back upon his pillows with a pacified growl.",m
1396,"He certainly looked ill, and he had grown thinner and whiter within the past month, and the lines in his waxlike face seemed to be deeper scored.",m
1397,"The girl went up beside the bed and stood there a moment, after she had bent over and kissed her grandfather's cheek, stroking with her hand the absurdly gorgeous mandarin's jacket--an imperial yellow one this time.",m
1398,"""Isn't this new?"" she asked.",m
1399,"""I seem never to have seen this one before.",m
1400,"It's quite wonderful.""",m
1401,The old gentleman looked down at it with the pride of a little girl over her first party frock.,m
1402,"He came as near simpering as a fierce person of eighty-six, with a square white beard, can come.",m
1403,"""Rather good, that!",m
1404,"What?"" said he.",m
1405,"""Yes, it's new.",m
1406,De Vries sent it me.,m
1407,It is my best one.,m
1408,Imperial yellow.,m
1409,Did you notice the little Show medallions with the swastika?,m
1410,Young Ste.,m
1411,"Marie was here this afternoon.""",m
1412,"He introduced the name with no pause or change of expression, as if Ste.",m
1413,Marie were a part of the decoration of the mandarin's jacket.,m
1414,"""I told him he was a damned fool.""",m
1415,"""Yes,"" said Miss Benham, ""I know.",m
1416,"He said you did.""",m
1417,"""I suppose,"" she said, ""that in a sort of very informal fashion I am engaged to him.",m
1418,"Well no, perhaps not quite that, but he seems to consider himself engaged to me, and when he has finished something very important that he has undertaken to do he is coming to ask me definitely to marry him.",m
1419,"No, I suppose we aren't engaged yet: at least I'm not.",m
1420,"But it's almost the same, because I suppose I shall accept him whether he fails or succeeds in what he is doing.""",m
1421,"""If he fails in it, whatever it may be,"" said old David, ""he won't give you a chance to accept him.",m
1422,He won't come back.,m
1423,I know him well enough for that.,m
1424,"He's a romantic fool, but he's a thorough-going fool.",m
1425,"He plays the game.""",m
1426,"The old man looked up to his granddaughter, scowling a little.",m
1427,"""You two are absurdly unsuited to each other,"" said he, ""and I told Ste.",m
1428,Marie so.,m
1429,"I suppose you think you're in love with him.""",m
1430,"""Yes,"" said the girl, ""I suppose I do.""",m
1431,"""Idleness and all?",m
1432,"You were rather severe on idleness at one time.""",m
1433,"""He isn't idle any more,"" said she.",m
1434,"""He has undertaken--of his own accord--to find Arthur.",m
1435,He has some theory about it.,m
1436,And he is not going to see me again until he has succeeded--or until a year is past.,m
1437,"If he fails, I fancy he won't come back.""",m
1438,"Old David gave a sudden hoarse exclamation, and his withered hands shook and stirred before him.",m
1439,Afterwards he fell to half-inarticulate muttering.,m
1440,"""The young romantic fool!--Don Quixote--like all the rest of them--those Ste.",m
1441,Maries.,m
1442,The fool and the angels.,m
1443,"The angels and the fool.""",m
1444,The girl distinguished words from time to time.,m
1445,For the most part he mumbled under his breath.,m
1446,"But when he had been silent a long time he said suddenly--  ""It would be ridiculously like him to succeed.""",m
1447,The girl gave a little sigh.,m
1448,"""I wish I dared hope for it,"" said she.",m
1449,"""I wish I dared hope for it.""",m
1450,"She had left a book that she wanted in the drawing-room, and when presently her grandfather fell asleep in his fitful manner, she went down after it.",m
1451,"In crossing the hall she came upon Captain Stewart, who was dressed for the street and had his hat and stick in his hands.",m
1452,"He did not live in his father's house, for he had a little flat in the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
1453,"Honore, but he was in and out a good deal.",m
1454,"He paused when he saw his niece and smiled upon her a benignant smile, which she rather disliked, because she disliked benignant people.",m
1455,"The two really saw very little of each other, though Captain Stewart often sat for hours together with his sister up in a little boudoir which she had furnished in the execrable taste which to her meant comfort, while that timid and colourless lady embroidered strange tea-cloths with stranger flora, and prattled about the heathen, in whom she had an academic interest.",m
1456,"He said--  ""Ah, my dear!",m
1457,"It's you?""",m
1458,"Indisputably it was, and there seemed to be no use of denying it, so Miss Benham said nothing, but waited for the man to go on if he had more to say.",m
1459,"""I dropped in,"" he continued, ""to see my father, but they told me he was asleep and so I didn't disturb him.",m
1460,"I talked a little while with your mother instead.""",m
1461,"""I have just come from him,"" said Miss Benham.",m
1462,"""He dozed off again as I left.",m
1463,"Still, if you had anything in particular to tell him, he'd be glad to be wakened, I fancy.",m
1464,"There's no news?""",m
1465,"""No,"" said Captain Stewart sadly, ""no, nothing.",m
1466,"I do not give up hope, but I am, I confess, a little discouraged.""",m
1467,"""We are all that, I should think,"" said Miss Benham briefly.",m
1468,"She gave him a little nod, and turned away into the drawing-room.",m
1469,"Her uncle's peculiar dry manner irritated her at times beyond bearing, and she felt that this was one of the times.",m
1470,"She had never had any reason for doubting that he was a good and kindly soul, but she disliked him because he bored her.",m
1471,Her mother bored her too--the poor woman bored everybody--but the sense of filial obligation was strong enough in the girl to prevent her from acknowledging this even to herself.,m
1472,"In regard to her uncle she had no sense of obligation whatever, except to be as civil to him as possible, and so she kept out of his way.",m
1473,She heard the heavy front door close and gave a little sigh of relief.,m
1474,"""If he had come in here and tried to talk to me,"" she said, ""I should have screamed.""",m
1475,Meanwhile Ste.,m
1476,"Marie, a man moving in a dream, uplifted, cloud-enwrapped, made his way homeward.",m
1477,"He walked all the long distance--that is, looking backward upon it later he thought he must have walked, but the half-hour was a blank to him, an indeterminate, a chaotic whirl of things and emotions.",m
1478,"In the little flat in the Rue d'Assas he came upon Richard Hartley, who, having found the door unlocked and the master of the place absent, had sat comfortably down with a pipe and a stack of Courriers Francais to wait.",m
1479,Ste.,m
1480,Marie burst into the doorway of the room where his friend sat at ease.,m
1481,"Hat, gloves and stick fell away from him in a sort of shower.",m
1482,He extended his arms high in air.,m
1483,"His face was, as it were, luminous.",m
1484,The Englishman regarded him morosely.,m
1485,"He said--  ""You look as if somebody had died and left you money.",m
1486,"What the devil are you looking like that for?""",m
1487,"""He!"" cried Ste.",m
1488,Marie in a great voice.,m
1489,"""He, the world is mine!",m
1490,"Embrace me, my infant!",m
1491,"Sacred name of a pig, why do you sit there?",m
1492,"Embrace me!""",m
1493,"He began to stride about the room, his head between his hands.",m
1494,"Speech lofty and ridiculous burst from him in a sort of splutter of fireworks, but the Englishman sat still in his chair, and a grey bleak look came upon him, for he began to understand.",m
1495,"He was more or less used to these outbursts, and he bore them as patiently as he could; but though seven times out of the ten they were no more than spasms of pure joy of living, and meant, ""It's a fine spring day,"" or ""I've just seen two beautiful princesses of milliners in the street,"" an inner voice told him that this time it meant another thing.",m
1496,"Quite suddenly he realised that he had been waiting for this, bracing himself against its onslaught.",m
1497,He had not been altogether blind through the past month.,m
1498,Ste.,m
1499,Marie seized him and dragged him from his chair.,m
1500,"""Dance, lump of flesh! dance, sacred English rosbif that you are!",m
1501,"Sing, gros polisson!",m
1502,"Sing!""",m
1503,"Abruptly, as usual, the mania departed from him, but not the glory; his eyes shone bright and triumphant.",m
1504,"""Ah, my old,"" said he, ""I am near the stars at last.",m
1505,My feet are on the top rungs of the ladder.,m
1506,"Tell me that you are glad!""",m
1507,The Englishman drew a long breath.,m
1508,"""I take it,"" said he, ""that means that you're--that she has accepted you, eh?""",m
1509,He held out his hand.,m
1510,He was a brave and honest man.,m
1511,Even in pain he was incapable of jealousy.,m
1512,"He said--  ""I ought to want to murder you, but I don't.",m
1513,I congratulate you.,m
1514,"You're an undeserving beggar, but so were the rest of us.",m
1515,"It was an open field, and you've won quite honestly.",m
1516,"My best wishes!""",m
1517,Then at last Ste.,m
1518,"Marie understood, and in a flash the glory went out of his face.",m
1519,"He cried--  ""Ah, mon cher ami!",m
1520,Pig that I am to forget.,m
1521,"Pig! pig! animal!""",m
1522,"The other man saw that tears had sprung to his eyes, and was horribly embarrassed to the very bottom of his good British soul.",m
1523,"""Yes! yes!"" he said gruffly.",m
1524,"""Quite so, quite so!",m
1525,"No consequence!""",m
1526,He dragged his hands away from Ste.,m
1527,"Marie's grasp, stuck them in his pockets, and turned to the window beside which he had been sitting.",m
1528,"It looked out over the sweet green peace of the Luxembourg Gardens with their winding paths and their clumps of trees and shrubbery, their flaming flower-beds, their groups of weather-stained sculpture.",m
1529,"A youth in labourer's corduroys and an unclean beret strolled along under the high palings, one arm was about the ample waist of a woman somewhat the youth's senior, but, as ever, love was blind.",m
1530,"The youth carolled in a high, clear voice: ""Vous etes si jolie,"" a song of abundant sentiment, and the young woman put up one hand and patted his cheek.",m
1531,So they strolled on and turned up into the Rue Vavin.,m
1532,Ste.,m
1533,"Marie, across the room, looked at his friend's square back, and knew that in his silent way the man was suffering.",m
1534,"A great sadness, the recoil from his trembling heights of bliss, came upon him and enveloped him.",m
1535,Was it true that one man's joy must inevitably be another's pain?,m
1536,"He tried to imagine himself in Hartley's place, Hartley in his; and he gave a little shiver.",m
1537,"He knew that if that bouleversement were actually to take place he would be as glad for his friend's sake as poor Hartley was now for his; but he knew also that the smile of congratulation would be a grimace of almost intolerable pain, and so he knew what Hartley's black hour must be like.",m
1538,"""You must forgive me,"" he said.",m
1539,"""I had forgotten.",m
1540,I don't know why.,m
1541,"Well, yes, happiness is a very selfish state of mind, I suppose.",m
1542,One thinks of nothing but one's self--and one other.,m
1543,I--during this past month I've been in the clouds.,m
1544,"You must forgive me.""",m
1545,The Englishman turned back into the room.,m
1546,Ste.,m
1547,"Marie saw that his face was as completely devoid of expression as it usually was, that his hands when he chose and lighted a cigarette were quite steady, and he marvelled.",m
1548,That would have been impossible for him under such circumstances.,m
1549,"""She has accepted you, I take it?"" said Hartley again.",m
1550,"""Not quite that,"" said he.",m
1551,"""Sit down and I'll tell you about it.""",m
1552,"So he told him about his hour with Miss Benham, and about what had been agreed upon between them, and about what he had undertaken to do.",m
1553,"""Apart from wishing to do everything in this world that I can do to make her happy,"" he said, ""--and she will never be at peace again until she knows the truth about her brother--apart from that, I'm purely selfish in the thing.",m
1554,I've got to win her respect as well as--the rest.,m
1555,"I want her to respect me, and she has never quite done that.",m
1556,I'm an idler.,m
1557,"So are you, but you have a perfectly good excuse.",m
1558,I have not.,m
1559,"I've been an idler because it suited me, because nothing turned up, and because I have enough to eat without working for my living.",m
1560,I know how she has felt about all that.,m

1562,"""You're taking on a big order,"" said the other man.",m

1566,"I've sworn that.""",m
1567,"The odd look of exaltation that Miss Benham had seen in his face, the look of knightly fervour, came there again, and Hartley saw it and knew that the man was stirred by no transient whim.",m
1568,"Oddly enough he thought, as had the girl earlier in the day, of those elder Ste.",m
1569,"Maries who had taken sword and lance and gone out into a strange world, a place of unknown terrors, afire for the Great Adventure.",m

1578,"He threw away his cigarette and lighted another, and he smoked it down almost to the end before he spoke.",m
1579,"At last he said--  ""I want to tell you something.",m

1604,I'm just a helper.,m
1605,"Some one to run errands, some one perhaps to take counsel with now and then.",m
1606,Look at it on the practical side!,m
1607,Two heads are certainly better than one.,m
1608,Certainly I could be of use to you.,m
1609,"And besides--well, I want to do something for her.",m
1610,"I--cared too, you see.",m
1611,"D'you think you could take me in?""",m
1612,It was the man's love that made his appeal irresistible.,m
1613,No one could appeal to Ste.,m
1614,Marie on that score in vain.,m
1615,"It was true that he had hoped to work alone, to win or lose alone, to stand, in this matter, quite on his own feet, but he could not deny the man who had loved her and lost her.",m
1616,Ste.,m
1617,Marie thrust out his hand.,m
1618,"""You love her too!"" he said.",m
1619,"""That is enough.",m
1620,We work together.,m
1621,I have a possibly foolish idea that if we can find a certain man we will learn something about Arthur Benham.,m
1622,"I'll tell you about it.""",m
1623,But before he could begin the door-bell jangled.                                                        Ste.,m
1624,Marie scowled.,m
1625,"""A caller would come singularly malapropos, just now,"" said he.",m
1626,"""I've half a mind not to go to the door.",m
1627,"I want to talk this thing over with you.""",m
1628,"""Whoever it is,"" objected Hartley, ""has been told by the concierge that you're at home.",m
1629,It may not be a caller anyhow.,m
1630,It may be a parcel or something.,m
1631,"You'd best go.""",m
1632,So Ste.,m
1633,"Marie went out into the little passage, blaspheming fluently the while.",m
1634,The Englishman heard him open the outer door of the flat.,m
1635,"He heard him exclaim in great surprise--  ""Ah, Captain Stewart!",m
1636,A great pleasure.,m
1637,Come in!,m
1638,"Come in!""",m
1639,"And he permitted himself a little blaspheming on his own account, for the visitor, as Ste.",m
1640,"Marie had said, came most malapropos, and besides he disliked Miss Benham's uncle.",m
1641,"He heard the American say--  ""I have been hoping for some weeks to give myself the pleasure of calling here, and to-day such an excellent pretext presented itself that I came straight away.""",m
1642,"Hartley heard him emit his mewing little laugh, and heard him say with the elephantine archness affected by certain dry and middle-aged gentlemen--  ""I come with congratulations.",m
1643,My niece has told me all about it.,m
1644,Lucky young man!,m
1645,"Ah!----""  He reached the door of the inner room and saw Richard Hartley standing by the window, and he began to apologise profusely, saying that he had had no idea that Ste.",m
1646,Marie was not alone.,m
1647,But Ste.,m
1648,"Marie said--  ""It doesn't in the least matter.",m
1649,I have no secrets from Hartley.,m
1650,"Indeed, I have just been talking with him about this very thing.""",m
1651,"But for all that he looked curiously at the elder man, and it struck him as very odd that Miss Benham should have gone straight to her uncle and told him all this.",m
1652,"It did not seem in the least like her, especially as he knew the two were on no terms of intimacy.",m
1653,He decided that she must have gone up to her grandfather's room to discuss it with that old gentleman--a reasonable enough hypothesis--and that Captain Stewart must have come in during the discussion.,m
1654,Quite evidently he had wasted no time in setting out upon his errand of congratulation.,m
1655,"""Then,"" said Captain Stewart, ""if I am to be good-naturedly forgiven for my stupidity, let me go on and say, in my capacity as a member of the family, that the news pleased me very much.",m
1656,"I was glad to hear it.""",m
1657,He shook Ste.,m
1658,"Marie's hand, looking very benignant indeed, and Ste.",m
1659,Marie was quite overcome with pleasure and gratitude: it seemed to him such a very kindly act in the elder man.,m
1660,"He produced things to smoke and drink, and Captain Stewart accepted a cigarette and mixed himself a rather stiff glass of absinthe--it was between five and six o'clock.",m
1661,"""And now,"" said he, when he was at ease in the most comfortable of the low cane chairs, and the glass of opalescent liquor was properly curdled and set at hand, ""now, having congratulated you and--ah, welcomed you, if I may put it so, as a probable future member of the family, I turn to the other feature of the affair.""",m
1662,He had an odd trick of lowering his head and gazing benevolently upon an auditor as if over the top of spectacles.,m
1663,It was one of his elderly ways.,m
1664,He beamed now upon Ste.,m
1665,"Marie in this manner, and, after a moment, turned and beamed upon Richard Hartley, who gazed stolidly back at him without expression.",m
1666,"""You have determined, I hear,"" said he, ""to join us in our search for poor Arthur.",m
1667,Good!,m
1668,"Good I I welcome you there, also.""",m
1669,Ste.,m
1670,Marie stirred uneasily in his chair.,m
1671,"""Well,"" said he, ""in a sense, yes.",m
1672,"That is, I've determined to devote myself to the search, and Hartley is good enough to offer to go in with me; but I think, if you don't mind----  Of course, I know it's very presumptuous and doubtless idiotic of us--but, if you don't mind, I think we'll work independently.",m
1673,"You see--well, I can't quite put it into words, but it's our idea to succeed or fail quite by our own efforts.",m
1674,"I dare say we shall fail, but it won't be for lack of trying.""",m
1675,Captain Stewart looked disappointed.,m
1676,"""Oh, I think,"" said he.",m
1677,"""Pardon me for saying it!  but I think you're rather foolish to do that.""",m
1678,He waved an apologetic hand.,m
1679,"""Of course, I comprehend your excellent motive.",m
1680,"Yes, as you say, you want to succeed quite on your own.",m
1681,"But, look at the practical side!",m
1682,You'll have to go over all the weary weeks of useless labour we have gone over.,m
1683,We could save you that.,m
1684,We have examined and followed up and at last given over a hundred clues that on the surface looked quite possible of success.,m
1685,You'll be doing that all over again.,m
1686,"In short, my dear friend, you will merely be following along a couple of months behind us.",m
1687,It seems to me a pity.,m
1688,"I shan't like to see you wasting your time and efforts.""",m
1689,"He dropped his eyes to the glass of Pernod which stood beside him, and he took it in his hand and turned it slowly, and watched the light gleam in strange pearl colours upon it.",m
1690,He glanced up again with a little smile which the two younger men found oddly pathetic.,m
1691,"""I should like to see you succeed,"" said Captain Stewart.",m
1692,"""I like to see youth and courage and high hope succeed.""",m
1693,"He said--  ""I am past the age of romance, though I am not so very old in years.",m
1694,"Romance has passed me by, but--I love it still.",m
1695,"It still stirs me surprisingly when I see it in other people--young people who are simple and earnest and who--and who are in love.""",m
1696,"He laughed gently, still turning the glass in his hands.",m
1697,"""I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist,"" he said, ""and an elderly sentimentalist is, as a rule, a ridiculous person.",m
1698,"Ridiculous or not, though, I have rather set my heart on your success in this undertaking.",m
1699,Who knows? you may succeed where we others have failed.,m
1700,Youth has such a way of charging in and carrying all before it by assault: such a way of overleaping barriers that look unsurmountable to older eyes!,m
1701,Youth!,m
1702,Youth!,m
1703,"""Eh, my God!"" said he, ""to be young again just for a little while.",m
1704,To feel the blood beat strong and eager.,m
1705,Never to be tired.,m
1706,"Eh, to be like one of you youngsters!",m
1707,"You, Ste.",m
1708,"Marie, or you, Hartley.",m
1709,"There's so little left for people when youth is gone.""",m
1710,"He bent his head again, staring down upon the glass before him, and for a while there was a silence which neither of the younger men cared to break.",m
1711,"""Don't refuse a helping hand!"" said Captain Stewart, looking up once more.",m
1712,"""Don't be overproud!",m
1713,I may be able to set you upon the right path.,m
1714,Not that I have anything definite to work upon.,m
1715,"I haven't, alas!",m
1716,But each day new clues turn up.,m
1717,"One day we shall find the real one, and that may be one that I have turned over to you to follow out.",m
1718,"One never knows.""",m
1719,"[Illustration: ""'Don't refuse a helping hand!' said Captain Stewart, looking up once more.",m
1720,"'Don't be overproud!'""]  Ste.",m
1721,"Marie looked across at Richard Hartley, but that gentleman was blowing smoke rings and to all outward appearance giving them his entire attention.",m
1722,"He looked back to Captain Stewart, and Stewart's eyes regarded him smiling a little wistfully, he thought.",m
1723,Ste.,m
1724,Marie scowled out of the window at the trees of the Luxembourg Gardens.,m
1725,"""I hardly know,"" said he.",m
1726,"""Of course I sound a braying ass in hesitating even a moment, but--in a way, you understand.",m
1727,I'm so anxious to do this or to fail in it quite on my own!,m
1728,You're--so tremendously kind about it that I don't know what to say.,m
1729,"I must seem very ungrateful, I know.",m
1730,"But I'm not.""",m
1731,"""No,"" said the elder man, ""you don't seem ungrateful at all.",m
1732,"I understand exactly how you feel about it, and I applaud your feeling--but not your judgment.",m
1733,"I am afraid that for the sake of a sentiment you're taking unnecessary risks of failure.""",m
1734,For the first time Richard Hartley spoke.,m
1735,"""I've an idea, you know,"" said he, ""that it's going to be a matter chiefly of luck.",m
1736,One day somebody will stumble on the right trail--and that might as well be Ste.,m
1737,Marie or I as your trained detectives.,m
1738,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir--I don't want to seem rude--your trained detectives do not seem to accomplish much in two months, do they?""",m
1739,Captain Stewart looked thoughtfully at the younger man.,m
1740,"""No,"" he said at last.",m
1741,"""I am sorry to say they don't seem to have accomplished much--except to prove that there are a great many places poor Arthur has not been to, and a great many people who have not seen him.",m
1742,"After all, that is something--the elimination of ground that need not be worked over again.""",m
1743,He set down the glass from which he had been drinking.,m
1744,"""I cannot agree with your theory,"" he said.",m
1745,"""I cannot agree that such work as this is best left to an accidental solution.",m
1746,Accidents are too rare.,m
1747,"We have tried to go at it in as scientific a way as could be managed--by covering large areas of territory, by keeping the police everywhere on the alert, by watching the boy's old friends and searching his favourite haunts.",m
1748,Personally I am inclined to think that he managed to slip away to America very early in the course of events--before we began to search for him.,m
1749,"And of course, I am having a careful watch kept there as well as here.",m
1750,But no trace has appeared as yet--nothing at all trustworthy.,m
1751,"Meanwhile I continue to hope and to work, but I grow a little discouraged.",m
1752,"In any case, though, we shall hear of him in three months more if he is alive.""",m
1753,"""Why three months?"" asked Ste.",m
1754,Marie.,m
1755,"""What do you mean by that?""",m
1756,"""In three months,"" said Captain Stewart, ""Arthur will be of age, and he can demand the money left him by his father.",m
1757,If he is alive he will turn up for that.,m
1758,"I have thought, from the first, that he is merely hiding somewhere until this time should be past.",m
1759,"He--you must know that he went away very angry, after a quarrel with his grandfather.",m
1760,My father is not a patient man.,m
1761,"He may have been very harsh with the boy.""",m
1762,"""Ah yes,"" said Hartley, ""but no boy, however young or angry, would be foolish enough to risk an absolute break with the man who is going to leave him a large fortune.",m
1763,Young Benham must know that his grandfather would never forgive him for staying away all this time if he stayed away of his own accord.,m
1764,"He must know that he'd be taking tremendous risks of being cut off altogether.""",m
1765,"""And besides,"" added Ste.",m
1766,"Marie, ""it is quite possible that your father, sir, may die at any time--any hour.",m
1767,And he's very angry with his grandson.,m
1768,"He may have cut him off already.""",m
1769,"Captain Stewart's eyes sharpened suddenly, but he dropped them to the glass in his hand.",m
1770,"""Have you any reason for thinking that?"" he asked.",m
1771,"""No,"" said Ste.",m
1772,Marie.,m
1773,"""I beg your pardon.",m
1774,I shouldn't have said it.,m
1775,That is a matter which concerns your family alone.,m
1776,I forgot myself.,m
1777,"The possibility occurred to me suddenly, for the first time.""",m
1778,But the elder man looked up at him with a smile.,m
1779,"""Pray don't apologise!"" said he.",m
1780,"""Surely we three can speak frankly together.",m
1781,And frankly I know nothing of my father's will.,m
1782,"But I don't think he would cut poor Arthur off, though he is, of course, very angry about the boy's leaving in the manner he did.",m
1783,No!,m
1784,I am sure he wouldn't cut him off.,m
1785,"He was fond of the lad, very fond--as we all were.""",m
1786,Captain Stewart glanced at his watch and rose with a little sigh.,m
1787,"""I must be off,"" said he.",m
1788,"""I have to dine out this evening, and I must get home to change.",m
1789,"There is a cab-stand near you?""",m
1790,He looked out of the window.,m
1791,"""Ah yes!",m
1792,"Just at the corner of the Gardens.""",m
1793,He turned about to Ste.,m
1794,"Marie, and held out his hand with a smile.",m
1795,"He said--  ""You refuse to join forces with us then?",m
1796,"Well, I'm sorry.",m
1797,"But for all that, I wish you luck.",m
1798,"Go your own way, and I hope you'll succeed.",m
1799,"I honestly hope that, even though your success may show me up for an incompetent bungler.""",m
1800,He gave a little kindly laugh and Ste.,m
1801,Marie tried to protest.,m
1802,"""Still,"" said the elder man, ""don't throw me over altogether.",m
1803,"If I can help you in any way, little or big, let me know.",m
1804,"If I can give you any hints, any advice, anything at all, I want to do it.",m
1805,"And if you happen upon what seems to be a promising clue, come and talk it over with me.",m
1806,"Oh, don't be afraid!",m
1807,I'll leave it to you to work out.,m
1808,"I shan't spoil your game.""",m
1809,"""Ah, now that's very good of you,"" said Ste.",m
1810,Marie.,m
1811,"""Only you make me seem more than ever an ungrateful fool.",m
1812,"Thanks, I will come to you with my troubles if I may.",m
1813,"I have a foolish idea that I want to follow out a little first, but doubtless I shall be running to you soon for information.""",m
1814,The elder man's eyes sharpened again with keen interest.,m
1815,"""An idea!"" he said quickly.",m
1816,"""You have an idea?",m
1817,"What--may I ask what sort of an idea?""",m
1818,"""Oh it's nothing,"" declared Ste.",m
1819,Marie.,m
1820,"""You have already laughed at it.",m
1821,"I just want to find that man O'Hara, that's all.",m
1822,"I've a feeling that I should learn something from him.""",m
1823,"""Ah!"" said Captain Stewart slowly.",m
1824,"""Yes, the man O'Hara.",m
1825,"There's nothing in that, I'm afraid.",m
1826,I've made inquiries about O'Hara.,m
1827,"It seems he left Paris six months ago, saying he was off for America.",m
1828,An old friend of his told me that.,m
1829,"So you must have been mistaken when you thought you saw him in the Champs Elysees, and he couldn't very well have had anything to do with poor Arthur.",m
1830,"I'm afraid that idea is hardly worth following up.""",m
1831,"""Perhaps not,"" said Ste.",m
1832,Marie.,m
1833,"""I seem to start badly, don't I?",m
1834,"Ah well, I'll have to come to you all the sooner, then.""",m
1835,"""You'll be welcome,"" promised Captain Stewart.",m
1836,"""Good-bye to you!",m
1837,"Good day, Hartley.",m
1838,Come and see me both of you.,m
1839,"You know where I live.""",m
1840,"He took his leave then, and Hartley, standing beside the window, watched him turn down the street, and at the corner get into one of the fiacres there and drive away.",m
1841,Ste.,m
1842,Marie laughed aloud.,m
1843,"""There's the second time,"" said he, ""that I've had him about O'Hara.",m
1844,"If he is as careless as that about everything, I don't wonder he hasn't found Arthur Benham.",m
1845,"O'Hara disappeared from Paris (publicly, that is) at about the time young Benham disappeared.",m
1846,"As a matter of fact he remains, or at least for a time remained in the city without letting his friends know, because I made no mistake about seeing him in the Champs Elysees.",m
1847,All that looks to me suspicious enough to be worth investigation.,m
1848,"""Of course,"" he admitted doubtfully--""of course I'm no detective, but that's how it looks to me.""",m
1849,"""I don't believe Stewart is any detective either,"" said Richard Hartley.",m
1850,"""He's altogether too cock-sure.",m
1851,That sort of man would rather die than admit he is wrong about anything.,m
1852,"He's a good old chap though, isn't he?",m
1853,I liked him to-day better than ever before.,m
1854,"I thought he was rather pathetic when he went on about his age.""",m
1855,"""He has a good heart,"" said Ste.",m
1856,Marie.,m
1857,"""Very few men under the circumstances would come here and be as decent as he was.",m
1858,"Most men would have thought I was a presumptuous ass and would have behaved accordingly.""",m
1859,Ste.,m
1860,Marie took a turn about the room and his face began to light up with its new excitement and exaltation.,m
1861,"""And to-morrow,"" he cried, ""to-morrow we begin!",m
1862,To-morrow we set out into the world and the Adventure is on foot.,m
1863,"God send it success!""",m
1864,"He laughed across at the other man, but it was a laugh of eagerness not of mirth.",m
1865,"""I feel,"" said he, ""like Jason.",m
1866,"I feel as if we were to set sail to-morrow for Colchis and the Golden Fleece.""",m
1867,"""Ye--es,"" said the other man a little drily.",m
1868,"""Yes, perhaps.",m
1869,"I don't want to seem critical, but isn't your figure somewhat ill chosen?""",m
1870,"""'Ill chosen'?"" cried Ste.",m
1871,Marie.,m
1872,"""What d'you mean?",m
1873,"Why ill chosen?""",m
1874,"""I was thinking of Medea,"" said Richard Hartley.                                              So on the next day these two rode forth upon their quest, and no quest was ever undertaken with a stouter courage or with a grimmer determination to succeed.",m
1875,"To put it fancifully they burnt their tower behind them, for to one of them at least--to him who led--there was no going back.",m
1876,"But after all they set forth under a cloud, and Ste.",m
1877,Marie took a heavy heart with him.,m
1878,"On the evening before an odd and painful incident had befallen, a singularly unfortunate incident.",m
1879,"It chanced that neither of the two men had a dinner engagement that evening, and so, after their old habit, they dined together.",m
1880,"There was some wrangling over where they should go, Hartley insisting upon Armenonville or the Madrid in the Bois, Ste.",m
1881,"Marie objecting that these would be full of tourists so late in June, and urging the claims of some quiet place in the Quarter, where they could talk instead of listening perforce to loud music.",m
1882,"In the end, for no particular reason, they compromised on the little Spanish restaurant in the Rue Helder.",m
1883,"They went there about eight o'clock, without dressing; for it is a very quiet place which the world does not visit, and they had a sopa de yerbas, and some langostinos, which are shrimps, and a heavenly arroz with fowl in it, and many tender succulent strips of red pepper.",m
1884,"They had a salad made out of a little of everything that grows green, with the true Spanish oil, which has a tang and a bouquet unappreciated by the philistine; and then they had a strange pastry and some cheese and green almonds.",m
1885,"And to make them glad they drank a bottle of old red Valdepenas, and afterwards a glass each of a special Manzanilla, upon which the restaurant very justly prides itself.",m
1886,"It was a simple dinner and a little stodgy for that time of the year, but the two men were hungry, and sat at table, almost alone in the upper room, for a long time, saying how good everything was, and from time to time despatching the saturnine waiter, a Madrileno, for more peppers.",m
1887,"When at last they came out into the narrow street and thence to the thronged Boulevard des Italiens, it was nearly eleven o'clock.",m
1888,"They stood for a little time in the shelter of a kiosk, looking down the boulevard to where the Place de l'Opera opened wide, and the lights of the Cafe de la Paix shone garish in the night, and Ste.",m
1889,"Marie said--  ""There's a street fete in Montmartre.",m
1890,"We might drive home that way.""",m
1891,"""An excellent idea,"" said the other man.",m
1892,"""The fact that Montmartre lies in an opposite direction from home makes the plan all the better.",m
1893,And after that we might drive home through the Bois.,m
1894,That's much farther in the wrong direction.,m
1895,"Lead on!""",m
1896,"So they sprang into a waiting fiacre, and were dragged up the steep stone-paved hill to the heights where La Boheme still reigns, though the glory of Moulin Rouge has departed, and the trail of tourist is over all.",m
1897,They found Montmartre very much en fete.,m
1898,"In the Place Blanche were two of the enormous and brilliantly lighted merry-go-rounds which only Paris knows--one furnished with stolid cattle, theatrical-looking horses, and Russian sleighs, the other with the ever-popular galloping pigs.",m
1899,"When these dreadful machines were in rotation mechanical organs concealed somewhere in their bowels emitted hideous brays and shrieks, which mingled with the shrieks of the ladies mounted upon the galloping pigs, and together insulted a peaceful sky.",m
1900,"The square was filled with that extremely heterogeneous throng which the Parisian street fete gathers together, but it was, for the most part, a well-dressed throng, largely recruited from the boulevards, and it was quite determined to have a very good time in the cheerful harmless Latin fashion.",m
1901,The two men got down from their fiacre and elbowed a way through the good-natured crowd to a place near the more popular of the merry-go-rounds.,m
1902,The machine was in rotation.,m
1903,"Its garish lights shone and glittered, its hidden mechanical organ blared a German waltz tune, the huge pink-varnished pigs galloped gravely up and down as the platform upon which they were mounted whirled round and round.",m
1904,"A little group of American trippers, sight-seeing, with a guide, stood near by, and one of the group, a pretty girl with red hair, demanded plaintively of the friend upon whose arm she hung: ""Do you think mamma would be shocked if we took a ride?",m
1905,"Wouldn't I love to!""",m
1906,Hartley turned laughing from this distressed maiden to Ste.,m
1907,Marie.,m
1908,"He was wondering with mild amusement why anybody should wish to do such a foolish thing, but Ste.",m
1909,Marie's eyes were fixed upon the galloping pigs and the eyes shone with a wistful excitement.,m
1910,To tell the truth it was impossible for him to look on at any form of active amusement without thirsting to join it.,m
1911,"A joyous and care-free lady in a blue hat, who was mounted astride upon one of the pigs, hurled a paper serpentine at him, and shrieked with delight when it knocked his hat off.",m
1912,"""That's the second time she has hit me with one of those things,"" he said, groping about his feet for the hat.",m
1913,"""Here, stop that boy with the basket!""",m
1914,A vendor of the little rolls of paper ribbon was shouting his wares through the crowd.,m
1915,Ste.,m
1916,"Marie filled his pockets with the things, and when the lady with the blue hat came round on the next turn, lassoed her neatly about the neck and held the end of the ribbon till it broke.",m
1917,"Then he caught a fat gentleman, who was holding himself on by his steed's neck, in the ear, and the red-haired American girl laughed aloud.",m
1918,"""When the thing stops,"" said Ste.",m
1919,"Marie, ""I'm going to take a ride, just one ride.",m
1920,"I haven't ridden a pig for many years.""",m
1921,"Hartley jeered at him, calling him an infant, but Ste.",m
1922,"Marie bought more serpentines, and when the platform came to a stop clambered up to it, and mounted the only unoccupied pig he could find.",m
1923,"His friend still scoffed at him and called him names, but Ste.",m
1924,"Marie tucked his long legs round the pig's neck and smiled back, and presently the machine began again to revolve.",m
1925,"At the end of the first revolution Hartley gave a shout of delight, for he saw that the lady with the blue hat had left her mount and was making her way along the platform towards where Ste.",m
1926,Marie sat hurling serpentines in the face of the world.,m
1927,"By the next time round she had come to where he was, mounted astride behind him, and was holding herself with one very shapely arm round his neck, while with the other she rifled his pockets for ammunition.",m
1928,Ste.,m
1929,"Marie grinned, and the public, loud in its acclaims, began to pelt the two with serpentines until they were hung with many-coloured ribbons like a Christmas-tree.",m
1930,"Even Richard Hartley was so far moved out of the self-consciousness with which his race is cursed as to buy a handful of the common missiles, and the lady in the blue hat returned his attention with skill and despatch.",m
1931,"But as the machine began to slacken its pace, and the hideous wail and blare of the concealed organ died mercifully down, Hartley saw that his friend's manner had all at once altered, that he sat leaning forward away from the enthusiastic lady with the blue hat, and that the paper serpentines had dropped from his hands.",m
1932,"Hartley thought that the rapid motion must have made him a little giddy, but presently, before the merry-go-round had quite stopped, he saw the man leap down and hurry towards him through the crowd.",m
1933,Ste.,m
1934,Marie's face was grave and pale.,m
1935,"He caught Hartley's arm in his hand and turned him round, crying in a low voice--  ""Come out of this as quickly as you can!",m
1936,"No, in the other direction.",m
1937,"I want to get away at once.""",m
1938,"""What's the matter?""",m
1939,Hartley demanded.,m
1940,"""Lady in the blue hat too friendly?",m
1941,"Well, if you're going to play this kind of game, you might as well play it.""",m
1942,"""Helen Benham was down there in the crowd,"" said Ste.",m
1943,Marie.,m
1944,"""On the opposite side from you.",m
1945,"She was with a party of people who got out of two motor-cars, to look on.",m
1946,"They were in evening things, so they had come from dinner somewhere, I suppose.",m
1947,"She saw me.""",m
1948,"""The devil!"" said Hartley under his breath.",m
1949,"Then he gave a shout of laughter, demanding--  ""Well, what of it?",m
1950,"You weren't committing any crime, were you?",m
1951,There's no harm in riding a silly pig in a silly merry-go-round.,m
1952,"Everybody does it in these fete things.""",m
1953,"But even as he spoke he knew how extremely unfortunate the meeting was, and the laughter went out of his voice.",m
1954,"""I'm afraid,"" said Ste.",m
1955,"Marie, ""she won't see the humour of it.",m
1956,"Good God, what a thing to happen!",m
1957,You know well enough what she'll think of me.,m
1958,"""At five o'clock this afternoon,"" he said bitterly, ""I left her with a great many fine high-sounding words about the quest I was to give my days and nights to--for her sake.",m
1959,I went away from her like a--knight going into battle--consecrated.,m
1960,"I tell you, there were tears in her eyes when I went.",m
1961,"And now, now, at midnight, she sees me riding a galloping pig in a street fete with a girl from the boulevards sitting on the pig with me and holding me round the neck before a thousand people.",m
1962,What will she think of me?,m
1963,What but one thing can she possibly think?,m
1964,"Oh, I know well enough!",m
1965,I saw her face before she turned away.,m
1966,"""And,"" he cried, ""I can't even go to her and explain--if there's anything to explain, and I suppose there is not.",m
1967,I can't even go to her.,m
1968,"I've sworn not to see her.""",m
1969,"""Oh, I'll do that,"" said the other man.",m
1970,"""I'll explain it to her, if any explanation's necessary.",m
1971,"I think you'll find that she will laugh at it.""",m
1972,But Ste.,m
1973,Marie shook his head.,m
1974,"""No, she won't,"" said he.",m
1975,"And Hartley could say no more, for he knew Miss Benham, and he was very much afraid that she would not laugh.",m
1976,They found a fiacre at the side of the square and drove home at once.,m
1977,"They were almost entirely silent all the long way, for Ste.",m
1978,"Marie was buried in gloom, and the Englishman, after trying once or twice to cheer him up, realised that he was best left to himself just then, and so held his tongue.",m
1979,But in the Rue d'Assas as Ste.,m
1980,Marie was getting down--Hartley kept the fiacre to go on to his rooms in the Avenue de l'Observatoire--he made a last attempt to lighten the man's depression.,m
1981,"He said--  ""Don't you be a silly ass about this!",m
1982,"You're making much too much of it, you know.",m
1983,"I'll go to her to-morrow or next day and explain, and she'll laugh--if she hasn't already done so.",m
1984,"""You know,"" he said, almost believing it himself, ""you are paying her a dashed poor compliment in thinking she's so dull as to misunderstand a little thing of this kind.",m
1985,"Yes, by Jove, you are!""",m
1986,Ste.,m
1987,"Marie looked up at him, and his face, in the light of the cab-lamp, showed a first faint gleam of hope.",m
1988,"""Do you think so?"" he demanded.",m
1989,"""Do you really think that?",m
1990,Maybe I am.,m
1991,"But--  O Lord, who would understand such an idiocy?",m
1992,Sacred imbecile that I am: why was I ever born?,m
1993,"I ask you.""",m
1994,"He turned abruptly and began to ring at the door, casting a brief ""Good-night,"" over his shoulder.",m
1995,"And, after a moment, Hartley gave it up and drove away.",m
1996,"Above, in the long shallow front room of his flat, with the three windows overlooking the Gardens, Ste.",m
1997,"Marie made lights, and after much rummaging unearthed a box of cigarettes of a peculiarly delectable flavour, which had been sent him by a friend in the Khedivial household.",m
1998,"He allowed himself one or two of them now and then, usually in sorrowful moments, as an especial treat.",m
1999,And this seemed to him to be the moment for smoking all there were left.,m
2000,Surely his need had never been greater.,m
2001,"In England he had, of course learnt to smoke a pipe, but pipe smoking always remained with him a species of accomplishment; it never brought him the deep and ruminative peace with which it enfolds the Anglo-Saxon heart.",m
2002,"The vieux Jacob of old-fashioned Parisian Bohemia inspired in him unconcealed horror, of cigars he was suspicious because, he said, most of the unpleasant people he knew smoked cigars: so he soothed his soul with cigarettes, and he was usually to be found with one between his fingers.",m
2003,"He lighted one of the precious Egyptians, and after a first ecstatic inhalation went across to one of the long windows, which was open, and stood there with his back to the room, his face to the peaceful fragrant night.",m
2004,"A sudden recollection came to him of that other night a month before, when he had stood on the Pont des Invalides with his eyes upon the stars, his feet upon the ladder thereunto.",m
2005,"His heart gave a sudden exultant leap within him when he thought how far and high he had climbed, but after the leap it shivered and stood still when this evening's misadventure came before him.",m
2006,Would she ever understand?,m
2007,He had no fear that Hartley would not do his best with her.,m
2008,Hartley was as honest and as faithful as ever a friend was in this world.,m
2009,He would do his best.,m
2010,But even then----  It was the girl's inflexible nature that made the matter so dangerous.,m
2011,"He knew that she was inflexible, and he took a curious pride in it.",m
2012,He admired it.,m
2013,So must have been those calm-eyed ancient ladies for whom other Ste.,m
2014,Maries went out to do battle.,m
2015,It was wellnigh impossible to imagine them lowering their eyes to silly revelry.,m
2016,They could not stoop to such as that.,m
2017,It was beneath their high dignity.,m
2018,And it was beneath hers also.,m
2019,"As for himself, he was a thing of patches.",m
2020,"Here a patch of exalted chivalry--a noble patch--there a patch of bourgeois child-like love of fun; here a patch of melancholic asceticism, there one of something quite the reverse.",m
2021,A hopeless patchwork he was.,m
2022,Must she not shrink from him when she knew?,m
2023,He could not quite imagine her understanding the wholly trivial and meaningless impulse that had prompted him to ride a galloping pig and cast paper serpentines at the assembled world.,m
2024,Apart from her view of the affair he felt no shame in it.,m
2025,The moment of childish gaiety had been but a passing mood.,m
2026,"It had in no way slackened his tense enthusiasm, dulled the keenness of his spirit, lowered his high flight.",m
2027,He knew that well enough.,m
2028,"But he wondered if she would understand, and he could not believe it possible.",m
2029,"The mood of exaltation in which they had parted that afternoon came to him, and then the sight of her shocked face as he had seen it in the laughing crowd in the Place Blanche.",m
2030,"""What must she think of me?"" he cried aloud.",m
2031,"""What must she think of me?""",m
2032,"So for an hour or more he stood in the open window staring into the fragrant night, or tramped up and down the long room, his hands behind his back, kicking out of his way the chairs and things which impeded him--torturing himself with fears and regrets and fancies, until at last in a calmer moment he realised that he was working himself up into an absurd state of nerves over something which was done and could not now be helped.",m
2033,The man had an odd streak of fatalism in his nature--that will have come of his southern blood--and it came to him now in his need.,m
2034,"For the work upon which he was to enter with the morrow he had need of clear wits, not scattered ones; a calm judgment, not disordered nerves.",m
2035,"So he took himself in hand, and it would have been amazing to any one unfamiliar with the abrupt changes of the Latin temperament, to see how suddenly Ste.",m
2036,Marie became quiet and cool and master of himself.,m
2037,"[Illustration: ""So for an hour or more he stood in the open window staring into the fragrant night.""]  ""It is done,"" he said with a little shrug, and if his face was for a moment bitter it quickly enough became impassive.",m
2038,"""It is done, and it cannot be undone--unless Hartley can undo it.",m
2039,"And now, revenons a nos moutons!",m
2040,"""Or at least,"" said he, looking at his watch--and it was between one and two--""at least to our beds!""",m
2041,"So he went to bed, and, so well had he recovered from his fit of excitement, he fell asleep almost at once.",m
2042,"But, for all that, the jangled nerves had their revenge.",m
2043,"He who commonly slept like the dead, without the slightest disturbance, dreamed a strange dream.",m
2044,"It seemed to him that he stood spent and weary in a twilit place, a waste place at the foot of a high hill.",m
2045,"At the top of the hill She sat upon a sort of throne, golden in a beam of light from heaven--serene, very beautiful, the end and crown of his weary labours.",m
2046,"His feet were set to the ascent of the height whereon she waited, but he was withheld.",m
2047,"From the shadows at the hill's foot a voice called to him in distress, anguish of spirit--a voice he knew, but he could not say whose voice.",m
2048,"It besought him out of utter need, and he could not turn away from it.",m
2049,"Then from those shadows eyes looked upon him, very great and dark eyes, and they besought him too; he did not know what they asked, but they called to him like the low voice, and he could not turn away.",m
2050,"He looked to the far height, and with all his power he strove to set his feet towards it--the goal of long labour and desire--but the eyes and the piteous voice held him motionless, for they needed him.",m
2051,From this anguish he awoke trembling.,m
2052,"And after a long time, when he was composed, he fell asleep once more, and once more he dreamed the dream.",m
2053,So morning found him pallid and unrefreshed.,m
2054,"But by daylight he knew whose eyes had besought him, and he wondered, and was a little afraid.                                                       *STE.",m
2055,MARIE GOES UPON A JOURNEY AND                     RICHARD HARTLEY PLEADS FOR HIM*   It may as well be admitted at the outset that neither Ste.,m
2056,"Marie nor Richard Hartley proved themselves to be geniuses, hitherto undeveloped, in the detective science.",m
2057,"They entered upon their self-appointed task with a fine fervour, but, as Miss Benham had suggested, with no other qualifications in particular.",m
2058,Ste.,m
2059,"Marie had a theory that when engaged in work of this nature you went into questionable parts of the city, ate and drank cheek by jowl with questionable people; if possible got them drunk while you remained sober (difficult feat), and sooner or later they said things which put you on the right road to your goal, or else confessed to you that they themselves had committed the particular crime in which you were interested.",m
2060,"He argued that this was the way it happened in books, and that surely people didn't write books about things of which they were ignorant.",m
2061,"Hartley, on the other hand, preferred the newer or scientific methods.",m
2062,You sat at home with a pipe and a whisky and water--if possible in a long dressing-gown with a cord round its middle.,m
2063,"You reviewed all the known facts of the case, and you did mathematics about them with Xs and Ys and many other symbols, and in the end, by a system of elimination, you proved that a certain thing must infallibly be true.",m
2064,"The chief difficulty for him in this was, he said, that he had been at Oxford instead of at Cambridge, and so the mathematics was rather beyond him.",m
2065,"In practice, however, they combined the two methods, which was doubtless as well as if they hadn't, because for some time they accomplished nothing whatever, and so neither one was able to sneer at the other's stupidity.",m
2066,This is not to say that they found nothing in the way of clues.,m
2067,"They found an embarrassment of them, and for some days went about in a fever of excitement over these; but the fever cooled when clue after clue turned out to be misleading.",m
2068,Of course Ste.,m
2069,"Marie's first efforts were directed towards tracing the movements of the Irishman, O'Hara, but the efforts were altogether unavailing.",m
2070,The man seemed to have disappeared as noiselessly and completely as had young Arthur Benham himself.,m
2071,He was unable even to settle with any definiteness the time of the man's departure from Paris.,m
2072,"Some of O'Hara's old acquaintances maintained that they had seen the last of him two months before, but a shifty-eyed person in rather cheaply smart clothes came up to Ste.",m
2073,"Marie one evening in Maxim's, and said he had heard that Ste.",m
2074,Marie was making inquiries about M. O'Hara.,m
2075,Ste.,m
2076,"Marie said he was, and that it was an affair of money, whereupon the cheaply smart individual declared that M. O'Hara had left Paris six months before to go to the United States of America, and that he had had a picture postal card, some weeks since, from New York.",m
2077,"The informant accepted an expensive cigar and a Dubonnet by way of reward, but presently departed into the night, and Ste.",m
2078,"Marie was left in some discouragement, his theory badly damaged.",m
2079,"He spoke of this encounter to Richard Hartley, who came on later to join him, and Hartley, after an interval of silence and smoke, said--  ""That was a lie.",m
2080,"The man lied.""",m
2081,"""Name of a dog, why?"" demanded Ste.",m
2082,"Marie, but the Englishman shrugged his shoulders.",m
2083,"""I don't know,"" he said.",m
2084,"""But I believe it was a lie.",m
2085,"The man came to you, sought you out to tell his story, didn't he?",m
2086,And all the others have given a different date?,m
2087,"Well, there you are!",m
2088,"For some reason this man or some one behind him--O'Hara himself, probably--wants you to believe that O'Hara is in America.",m
2089,"I dare say he's in Paris all the while.""",m
2090,"""I hope you're right,"" said the other.",m
2091,"""And I mean to make sure, too.",m
2092,"It certainly was odd, this strange being hunting me out to tell me that.",m
2093,"I wonder, by the way, how he knew I'd been making inquiries about O'Hara.",m
2094,"I've questioned only two or three people, and then in the most casual way.",m
2095,"Yes, it's odd.""",m
2096,"It was about a week after this--a fruitless week, full of the alternate brightness of hope and the gloom of disappointment--that he met Captain Stewart, to whom he had been more than once on the point of appealing.",m
2097,He happened upon him quite by chance one morning in the Rue Royale.,m
2098,"Captain Stewart was coming out of a shop, a very smart-looking shop, devoted, as Ste.",m
2099,"Marie, with some surprise and much amusement, observed, to ladies' hats, and the price of hats must have depressed him, for he looked in an ill humour and older and more yellow than usual.",m
2100,"But his face altered suddenly when he saw the younger man, and he stopped, and shook Ste.",m
2101,Marie's hand with every evidence of pleasure.,m
2102,"""Well met! well met!"" he exclaimed.",m
2103,"""If you are not in a hurry, come and sit down somewhere and tell me about yourself.""",m
2104,"They picked their way across the street to the terrace of the Taverne Royale, which was almost deserted at that hour, and sat down at one of the little tables well back from the pavement, in a corner.",m
2105,"""Is it fair?"" queried Captain Stewart, ""is it fair as a rival investigator to ask you what success you have had?""",m
2106,Ste.,m
2107,Marie laughed rather ruefully and confessed that he had as yet no success at all.,m
2108,"""I've just come,"" said he, ""from pricking one bubble that promised well, and Hartley is up in Montmartre destroying another, I fancy.",m
2109,"Oh well, we didn't expect it to be child's play.""",m
2110,"Captain Stewart raised his little glass of dry vermouth in an old-fashioned salute, and drank from it.",m
2111,"""You,"" said he, ""you were--ah, full of some idea of connecting this man, this Irishman, O'Hara, with poor Arthur's disappearance.",m
2112,"You've found that not so promising, as you went on, I take it.""",m
2113,"""Well, I've been unable to trace O'Hara,"" said Ste.",m
2114,Marie.,m
2115,"""He seems to have disappeared as completely as your nephew.",m
2116,I suppose you have no clues to spare?,m
2117,"I confess I'm out of them, at the moment.""",m
2118,"""Oh, I have plenty,"" said the elder man.",m
2119,"""A hundred.",m
2120,"More than I can possibly look after.""",m
2121,He gave a little chuckling laugh.,m
2122,"""I've been waiting for you to come to me,"" he said.",m
2123,"""It was a little ungenerous perhaps, but we all love to say, 'I told you so.'",m
2124,"Yes, I have a great quantity of clues, and, of course, they all seem to be of the greatest and most exciting importance.",m
2125,"That's a way clues have.""",m
2126,"He took an envelope from an inner pocket of his coat, and sorted several folded papers which were in it.",m
2127,"""I have here,"" said he, ""memoranda of two chances, shall I call them?--which seem to me very good, though, as I have already said, every clue seems good.",m
2128,"That is the maddening, the heart-breaking part of such an investigation.",m
2129,"I have made these brief notes from letters received, one yesterday, one the day before, from an agent of mine who has been searching the bains de mer of the north coast.",m
2130,"This agent writes that some one very much resembling poor Arthur has been seen at Dinard and also at Deauville, and he urges me to come there, or to send a man there at once to look into the matter.",m
2131,"You will ask, of course, why this agent himself does not pursue the clue he has found.",m
2132,"Unfortunately he has been called to London upon some pressing family matter of his own; he is an Englishman.""",m
2133,"""Why haven't you gone yourself?"" asked Ste.",m
2134,Marie.,m
2135,But the elder man shrugged his shoulders and smiled a tired deprecatory smile.,m
2136,"""Oh, my friend,"" said he, ""if I should attempt personally to investigate one half of these things, I should be compelled to divide myself into twenty parts.",m
2137,"No, I must stay here.",m
2138,"There must be, alas! the spider at the centre of the web.",m
2139,"I cannot go, but if you think it worth while I will gladly turn over the memoranda of these last clues to you.",m
2140,"They may be the true clues, they may not.",m
2141,"At any rate, some one must look into them.",m
2142,"Why not you and your partner--or shall I say assistant?""",m
2143,"""Why, thank you!"" cried Ste.",m
2144,Marie.,m
2145,"""A thousand thanks.",m
2146,Of course I shall be--we shall be glad to try this chance.,m
2147,"On the face of it, it sounds very reasonable.",m
2148,"Your nephew, from what I remember of him, is much more apt to be in some place that is amusing--some place of gaiety--than hiding away where it is merely dull, if he has his choice in the matter, that is--if he is free.",m
2149,"And yet----"" he turned and frowned thoughtfully at the elder man.",m
2150,"""What I want to know,"" said he, ""is how the boy is supporting himself all this time.",m
2151,"You say he had no money, or very little, when he went away.",m
2152,"How is he managing to live, if your theory is correct--that he is staying away of his own accord?",m
2153,"It costs a lot of money to live as he likes to live.""",m
2154,Captain Stewart nodded.,m
2155,"""Oh, that,"" said he, ""that is a question I have often proposed to myself.",m
2156,Frankly it's beyond me.,m
2157,"I can only surmise that poor Arthur, who had scattered a small fortune about in foolish loans, managed, before he actually disappeared (mind you, we didn't begin to look for him until a week had gone by), managed to collect some of this money, and so went away with something in pocket.",m
2158,"That, of course, is only a guess.""",m
2159,"""It is possible,"" said Ste.",m
2160,"Marie doubtfully, ""but--I don't know.",m
2161,It is not very easy to raise money from the sort of people I imagine your nephew to have lent it to.,m
2162,"They borrow but they don't repay.""",m
2163,He glanced up with a half-laughing half-defiant air.,m
2164,"""I can't,"" said he, ""rid myself of a belief that the boy is here in Paris and he is not free to come or go.",m
2165,"It's only a feeling, but it is very strong in me.",m
2166,Of course I shall follow out these clues you've been so kind as to give me.,m
2167,"I shall go to Dinard and Deauville, and Hartley, I imagine, will go with me; but I haven't great confidence in them.""",m
2168,"Captain Stewart regarded him reflectively for a time, and in the end he smiled.",m
2169,"""If you will pardon my saying it,"" he said, ""your attitude is just a little womanlike.",m
2170,You put away reason for something vaguely intuitive.,m
2171,"I always distrust intuition myself.""",m
2172,Ste.,m
2173,Marie frowned a little and looked uncomfortable.,m
2174,He did not relish being called womanlike--few men do--but he was bound to admit that the elder man's criticism was more or less just.,m
2175,"""Moreover,"" pursued Captain Stewart, ""you altogether ignore the point of motive--as I may have suggested to you before.",m
2176,"There could be no possible motive, so far as I am aware, for kidnapping or detaining or in any way harming my nephew except the desire for money; but, as you know, he had no large sum of money with him, and no demand has been made upon us since his disappearance.",m
2177,"I'm afraid you can't get round that.""",m
2178,"""No,"" said Ste.",m
2179,"Marie, ""I'm afraid I can't.",m
2180,"Indeed, leaving that aside (and it can't be left aside), I still have almost nothing with which to prop up my theory.",m
2181,"I told you it was only a feeling.""",m
2182,"He took up the memoranda which Captain Stewart had laid upon the marble-topped table between them, and read the notes through.",m
2183,"""Please,"" said he, ""don't think I am ungrateful for this chance.",m
2184,I am not.,m
2185,"I shall do my best with it, and I hope it may turn out to be important.""",m
2186,He gave a little wry smile.,m
2187,"""I have all sorts of reasons,"" he said, ""for wishing to succeed as soon as possible.",m
2188,You may be sure that there won't be any delays on my part.,m
2189,And now I must be going on.,m
2190,"I am to meet Hartley for lunch on the other side of the river, and, if we can manage it, I should like to start north this afternoon or evening.",m
2191,"""Good!"" said Captain Stewart, smiling.",m
2192,"""Good! that is what I call true promptness.",m
2193,You lose no time at all.,m
2194,"Go to Dinard and Deauville, by all means, and look into this thing thoroughly.",m

2196,"Take Mr. Hartley with you and do your best.""",m
2197,"He paid for the two glasses of aperatif, and Ste.",m
2198,Marie could not help observing that he left on the table a very small tip.,m
2199,The waiter cursed him audibly as the two walked away.,m
2200,"""If you have returned by a week from to-morrow,"" he said, as they shook hands, ""I should like to have you keep that evening--Thursday--for me.",m
2201,I am having a very informal little party in my rooms.,m
2202,"There will be two or three of the opera people there, and they will sing for us, and the others will be amusing enough.",m
2203,All young.,m
2204,All young.,m
2205,"I like young people about me.""",m
2206,He gave his odd little mewing chuckle.,m
2207,"""And the ladies must be beautiful as well as young.",m
2208,Come if you are here!,m
2209,"I'll drop a line to Mr. Hartley also.""",m
2210,He shook Ste.,m
2211,Marie's hand and went away down the street towards the Rue du Faubourg St.,m
2212,"Honore, where he lived.",m
2213,Ste.,m
2214,"Marie met Hartley as he expected to do, at lunch, and they talked over the possibilities of the Dinard and Deauville expedition.",m
2215,In the end they decided that Ste.,m
2216,"Marie should go alone, but that he was to telegraph, later on, if the clue looked promising.",m
2217,"Hartley had two or three investigations on foot in Paris, and stayed on to complete these.",m
2218,"Also he wished, as soon as possible, to see Helen Benham and explain Ste.",m
2219,Marie's ride on the galloping pigs.,m
2220,"Ten days had elapsed since that evening, but Miss Benham had gone into the country the next day to make a visit at the de Saulnes' chateau on the Oise.",m
2221,So Ste.,m
2222,"Marie packed a portmanteau with clothes and things, and departed by a mid-afternoon train to Dinard, and, towards five, Richard Hartley walked down to the Rue de l'Universite.",m
2223,"He thought it just possible that Miss Benham might by now have returned to town, but if not he meant to have half an hour's chat with old David Stewart, whom he had not seen for some weeks.",m
2224,At the door he learnt that Mademoiselle was that very day returned and was at home.,m
2225,"So he went in to the drawing-room, reserving his visit to old David until later.",m
2226,He found the room divided into two camps.,m
2227,"At one side Mrs. Benham conversed in melancholic monotones with two elderly French ladies, who were clad in depressing black of a dowdiness surpassed only in English provincial towns.",m
2228,It was as if the three mourned together over the remains of some dear one who lay dead amongst them.,m
2229,"Hartley bowed low with an uncontrollable shiver, and turned to the tea-table, where Miss Benham sat in the seat of authority, flanked by a young American lady, whom he had met before, and by Baron de Vries, whom he had not seen since the evening of the de Saulnes' dinner party.",m
2230,"Miss Benham greeted him with evident pleasure, and to his great delight remembered just how he liked his tea--three pieces of sugar and no milk.",m
2231,It always flatters a man when his little tastes of this sort are remembered.,m
2232,"The four fell at once into conversation together, and the young American lady asked Hartley why Ste.",m
2233,Marie was not with him.,m
2234,"""I thought you two always went about together,"" she said.",m
2235,"""Were never seen apart and all that--a sort of modern Damon and Phidias.""",m
2236,Hartley caught Baron de Vries' eye and looked away again hastily.,m
2237,"""My--ah, Phidias,"" said he, resisting an irritable desire to correct the lady, ""got mislaid to-day.",m
2238,"It shan't happen again, I promise you.",m
2239,"He's a very busy person just now, though.",m
2240,He hasn't time for social dissipation.,m
2241,"I'm the butterfly of the pair.""",m
2242,The lady gave a sudden laugh.,m
2243,"""He was busy enough the last time I saw him,"" she said, crinkling her eyelids.",m
2244,She turned to Miss Benham.,m
2245,"""Do you remember that evening we were going home from the Madrid, and motored round by Montmartre to see the fete?""",m
2246,"""Yes,"" said Miss Benham, unsmiling, ""I remember.""",m
2247,"""Your friend, Ste.",m
2248,"Marie,"" said the American lady to Hartley, ""was distinctly the lion of the fete--at the moment we arrived, anyhow.",m
2249,"He was riding a galloping pig and throwing those paper streamer things--what do you call them?--with both hands, and a genial lady in a blue hat was riding the same pig and helping him out.",m
2250,It was just like the Vie de Boheme and the other books.,m
2251,"I found it charming.""",m
2252,Baron de Vries emitted an amused chuckle.,m
2253,"""That was very like Ste.",m
2254,"Marie,"" he said.",m
2255,"""Ste.",m
2256,Marie is a very exceptional young man.,m
2257,"He can be an angel one moment, a child playing with toys the next, and--well, a rather commonplace social favourite the third.",m
2258,It all comes of being romantic--imaginative.,m
2259,Ste.,m
2260,Marie--I know nothing about this evening of which you speak--but Ste.,m
2261,Marie is quite capable of stopping on his way to a funeral to ride a galloping pig--or on his way to his own wedding.,m
2262,"""And the pleasant part of it is,"" said Baron de Vries, ""that the lad would turn up at either of these two ceremonies not a bit the worse, outside or in, for his ride.""",m
2263,"""Ah, now that's an oddly close shot,"" said Hartley.",m
2264,"He paused a moment, looking towards Miss Benham, and said--  ""I beg pardon!",m
2265,"Were you going to speak?""",m
2266,"""No,"" said Miss Benham, moving the things about on the tea-table before her, and looking down at them.",m
2267,"""No, not at all!""",m
2268,"""You came oddly close to the truth,"" the man went on, turning back to Baron de Vries.",m
2269,"He was speaking for Helen Benham's ears, and he knew she would understand that, but he did not wish to seem to be watching her.",m
2270,"""I was with Ste.",m
2271,"Marie on that evening,"" he said.",m
2272,"""No!",m
2273,"I wasn't riding a pig, but I was standing down in the crowd throwing serpentines at the people who were.",m
2274,And I happen to know that he--that Ste.,m
2275,"Marie was on that day, that evening, more deeply concerned about something, more absolutely wrapped up in it, devoted to it, than I have ever known him to be about anything since I first knew him.",m
2276,"The galloping pig was an incident that made, except for the moment, no impression whatever upon him.""",m
2277,Hartley nodded his head.,m
2278,"""Yes,"" said he, ""Ste.",m
2279,Marie can be an angel one moment and a child playing with toys the next.,m
2280,"When he sees toys he always plays with them, and he plays hard, but when he drops them they go completely out of his mind.""",m
2281,The American lady laughed.,m
2282,"""Gracious me!"" she cried.",m
2283,"""You two are emphatic enough about him, aren't you?""",m
2284,"""We know him,"" said Baron de Vries.",m
2285,Hartley rose to replace his empty cup on the tea-table.,m
2286,"Miss Benham did not meet his eyes, and as he moved away again she spoke to her friend about something they were going to do on the next day, so Hartley went across to where Baron de Vries sat at a little distance, and took a place beside him on the chaise longue.",m
2287,The Belgian greeted him with raised eyebrows and the little half-sad half-humorous smile which was characteristic of him in his gentler moments.,m
2288,"""You were defending our friend with a purpose,"" he said in a low voice.",m
2289,"""Good!",m
2290,"I am afraid he needs it--here.""",m
2291,The younger man hesitated a moment.,m
2292,"Then he said--  ""I came on purpose to do that.",m
2293,Ste.,m
2294,Marie knows that she saw him on that confounded pig.,m
2295,"He was half wild with distress over it because--well, the meeting was singularly unfortunate, just then.",m
2296,"I can't explain----""  ""You needn't explain,"" said the Belgian gravely.",m
2297,"""I know.",m
2298,"Helen told me some days since, though she did not mention this encounter.",m
2299,"Yes, defend him with all your power, if you will.",m
2300,Stay after we others have gone and--have it out with her.,m
2301,"The Phidias lady (I must remember that mot, by the way) is preparing to take her leave now, and I will follow her at once.",m
2302,She shall believe that I am enamoured--that I sigh for her.,m
2303,"""Eh!"" said he, shaking his head.",m
2304,"And the lines in the kindly old face seemed to deepen, but in a sort of grave tenderness.",m
2305,"""Eh, so love has come to the dear lad at last!",m
2306,"Ah! of course, the hundred other affairs!",m
2307,"Yes, yes.",m
2308,But they were light.,m
2309,No seriousness in them.,m
2310,The ladies may have loved.,m
2311,He didn't very much.,m
2312,"This time, I'm afraid----""  Baron de Vries paused as if he did not mean to finish his sentence, and Hartley said--  ""You say 'afraid'!",m
2313,"Why, afraid?""",m
2314,The Belgian looked up at him reflectively.,m
2315,"""Did I say 'afraid'?"" he asked.",m
2316,"""Well--perhaps it was the word I wanted.",m
2317,I wonder if these two are fitted for each other.,m
2318,I am fond of them both.,m
2319,"I think you know that, but--she's not very flexible, this child.",m
2320,And she hasn't much humour.,m
2321,"I love her, but I know those things are true.",m
2322,I wonder if one ought to marry Ste.,m
2323,"Marie without flexibility and without humour.""",m
2324,"""If they love each other,"" said Richard Hartley, ""I expect the other things don't count.",m
2325,"Do they?""",m
2326,"Baron de Vries rose to his feet, for he saw that the Phidias lady was going.",m
2327,"""Perhaps not,"" said he;",m
2328,"""I hope not.",m
2329,"In any case, do your best for him with Helen.",m
2330,Make her comprehend if you can.,m
2331,"I am afraid she is unhappy over the affair.""",m
2332,"He made his adieux and went away with the American lady, to that young person's obvious excitement.",m
2333,"And after a moment the three ladies across the room departed also, Mrs. Benham explaining that she was taking her two friends up to her own sitting-room to show them something vaguely related to the heathen.",m
2334,So Hartley was left alone with Helen Benham.,m
2335,"It was not his way to beat about the bush, and he gave battle at once.",m
2336,"He said, standing to say it more easily--  ""You know why I came here to-day.",m
2337,It was the first chance I've had since that--unfortunate evening.,m
2338,I came on Ste.,m
2339,"Marie's account.""",m
2340,"Miss Benham said a weak--  ""Oh!""",m
2341,"And because she was nervous and overwrought and because the thing meant so much to her, she said cheaply--  ""He owes me no apologies.",m
2342,"He has a perfect right to act as he pleases, you know.""",m
2343,The Englishman frowned across at her.,m
2344,"""I didn't come to make apologies,"" said he.",m
2345,"""I came to explain.",m
2346,"Well, I have explained--Baron de Vries and I together.",m
2347,"That's just how it happened, and that's just how Ste.",m
2348,Marie takes things.,m
2349,"The point is, that you've got to understand it.",m
2350,"I've got to make you.""",m
2351,The girl smiled up at him dolefully.,m
2352,"""You look,"" she said, ""as if you were going to beat me if necessary.",m
2353,"You look very warlike.""",m
2354,"""I feel warlike,"" the man said, nodding.",m
2355,"He said--  ""I'm fighting for a friend to whom you are doing, in your mind, an injustice.",m
2356,"I know him better than you do, and I tell you you're doing him a grave injustice.",m
2357,"You're failing altogether to understand him.""",m
2358,"""I wonder,"" the girl said, looking very thoughtfully down at the table before her.",m
2359,"""I know,"" said he.",m
2360,"Quite suddenly she gave a little overwrought cry, and she put up her hands over her face.",m
2361,"""Oh, Richard!"" she said, ""that day when he was here!",m
2362,"He left me---- Oh, I cannot tell you at what a height he left me!",m
2363,It was something new and beautiful.,m
2364,He swept me to the clouds with him.,m
2365,And I might--perhaps I might have lived on there.,m
2366,Who knows?,m
2367,But then that hideous evening!,m
2368,"Ah, it was too sickening, the fall back to common earth again!""",m
2369,"""I know,"" said the man gently, ""I know.",m
2370,"And he knew, too.",m
2371,Directly he'd seen you he knew how you would feel about it.,m
2372,I'm not pretending that it was of no consequence.,m
2373,"It was unfortunate, of course.",m
2374,"But--the point is it did not mean in him any slackening, any stooping, any letting go.",m
2375,It was a moment's incident.,m
2376,We went to the wretched place by accident after dinner.,m
2377,Ste.,m
2378,"Marie saw those childish lunatics at play, and for about two minutes he played with them.",m
2379,"The lady in the blue hat made it appear a little more extreme, and that's all.""",m
2380,Miss Benham rose to her feet and moved restlessly back and forth.,m
2381,"""Oh, Richard!"" she said, ""the golden spell is broken--the enchantment he laid upon me that day.",m
2382,"I'm not like him, you know.",m
2383,"Oh, I wish I were!",m
2384,I wish I were!,m
2385,I can't change from hour to hour.,m
2386,I can't rise to the clouds again after my fall to earth.,m
2387,It has all--become something different.,m
2388,"""Don't misunderstand me,"" she cried;",m
2389,"""I don't mean that I've ceased to care for him.",m
2390,"No, far from that!",m
2391,"But I was in such an exalted heaven, and now I'm not there any more.",m
2392,Perhaps he can lift me to it again.,m
2393,"Oh yes, I'm sure he can when I see him once more; but I wanted to go on living there so happily while he was away!",m
2394,"Do you understand at all?""",m
2395,"""I think I do,"" the man said, but he looked at her very curiously and a little sadly; for it was the first time he had ever seen her swept from her superb poise by any emotion, and he hardly recognised her.",m
2396,"It was very bitter to him to realise that he could never have stirred her to this, never under any conceivable circumstances.",m
2397,The girl came to him where he stood and touched his arm with her hand.,m
2398,"""He is waiting to hear how I feel about it all, isn't he?"" she said.",m
2399,"""He is waiting to know that I understand.",m
2400,"Will you tell him a little lie for me, Richard?",m
2401,No!,m
2402,You needn't tell a lie;,m
2403,I will tell it.,m
2404,Tell him that I said I understood perfectly.,m
2405,"Tell him that I was shocked for a moment, but that afterwards I understood and thought no more about it.",m
2406,Will you tell him I said that?,m
2407,"It won't be a lie from you, because I did say it.",m
2408,"Oh, I will not grieve him or hamper him now while he is working in my cause!",m
2409,"I'll tell him a lie rather than have him grieve.""",m
2410,"""Need it be a lie?"" said Richard Hartley.",m
2411,"""Can't you truly believe what you've said?""",m
2412,She shook her head slowly.,m
2413,"""I'll try,"" said she, ""but--my golden spell is broken, and I can't mend it alone.",m
2414,"I'm sorry.""",m
2415,"He turned with a little sigh to leave her, but Miss Benham followed him towards the door of the drawing-room.",m
2416,"""You're a good friend, Richard,"" she said, when she had come near.",m
2417,"""You're a good friend to him.""",m
2418,"""He deserves good friends,"" said the man stoutly.",m
2419,"""And besides,"" said he, ""we're brothers in arms nowadays.",m
2420,"We've enlisted together to fight for the same cause.""",m
2421,The girl fell back with a little cry.,m
2422,"""Do you mean,"" she said, after a moment, ""do you mean that you are working with him--to find Arthur?""",m
2423,Hartley nodded.,m
2424,"""But,"" said she stammering, ""but, Richard----""  The man checked her.",m
2425,"""Oh, I know what I'm doing,"" said he.",m
2426,"""My eyes are open.",m
2427,"I know that I'm not--well, in the running.",m

2429,Marie.,m
2430,That's all.,m
2431,"It pleases me to be useful.""",m
2432,"He went away with that, not waiting for an answer; and the girl stood where he had left her, staring after him.                                                              Ste.",m
2433,"Marie returned, after three days, from Dinard in a depressed and somewhat puzzled frame of mind.",m
2434,"He had found no trace whatever of Arthur Benham either at Dinard or at Deauville, and, what was more, he was unable to discover that any one even remotely resembling that youth had been seen at either place.",m
2435,"The matter of identification, it seemed to him, should be a rather simple one.",m
2436,"In the first place, the boy's appearance was not at all French, nor for that matter English: it was very American.",m
2437,Also he spoke French--so Ste.,m
2438,"Marie had been told--very badly, having for the language that scornful contempt peculiar to Anglo-Saxons of a certain type.",m
2439,"His speech, it seemed, was, like his appearance, ultra-American, full of strange idioms and oddly pronounced.",m
2440,"In short, such a youth would be rather sure to be remembered by any hotel management and staff with which he might have come in contact.",m
2441,At first Ste.,m
2442,"Marie pursued his investigations quietly and, as it were, casually, but, after his initial failure, he went to the managements of the various hotels and lodging-houses and to the cafes and bathing establishments, and told them with all frankness a part of the truth--that he was searching for a young man whose disappearance had caused great distress to his family.",m
2443,He was not long in discovering that no such young man could have been either in Dinard or Deauville.,m
2444,"The thing which puzzled him was that, apart from finding no trace of the missing boy, he also found no trace of Captain Stewart's agent--the man who had been first on the ground.",m
2445,"No one seemed able to recollect that such a person had been making inquiries, and Ste.",m
2446,Marie began to suspect that his friend was being imposed upon.,m
2447,He determined to warn Stewart that his agents were earning their fees too easily.,m
2448,So he returned to Paris more than a little dejected and sore over this waste of time and effort.,m
2449,"He arrived by a noon tram, and drove across the city in a fiacre to the Rue d'Assas.",m
2450,"But as he was in the midst of unpacking his portmanteau, for he kept no servant (a woman came in once a day to ""do"" the rooms), the door-bell rang.",m
2451,"It was Baron de Vries, and Ste.",m
2452,Marie admitted him with an exclamation of surprise and pleasure.,m
2453,"""You passed me in the street just now,"" explained the Belgian, ""and, as I was a few minutes early for a lunch engagement, I followed you up.""",m
2454,He pointed with his stick at the open bag.,m
2455,"""Ah, you have been on a journey!",m
2456,"Detective work?""",m
2457,Ste.,m
2458,"Marie pushed his guest into a chair, gave him cigarettes, and told him about the fruitless expedition to Dinard.",m
2459,"He spoke also of his belief that Captain Stewart's agent had never really found a clue at all, and at that Baron de Vries nodded his grey head and said, ""Ah!"" in a tone of some significance.",m
2460,"Afterwards he smoked a little while in silence, but presently he said, as if with some hesitation--  ""May I be permitted to offer a word of advice?""",m
2461,"""But surely!"" cried Ste.",m
2462,"Marie, kicking away the half-empty portmanteau.",m
2463,"""Why not?""",m
2464,"""Do whatever you are going to do in this matter according to your own judgment,"" said the elder man.",m
2465,"""Or according to Mr. Hartley's and your combined judgments.",m
2466,"Make your investigations without reference to our friend Captain Stewart.""",m
2467,"He halted there as if that were all he had meant to say, but when he saw Ste.",m
2468,"Marie's raised eyebrows, he frowned and went on slowly as if picking his words with some care.",m
2469,"""I should be sorry,"" he said, ""to have Captain Stewart at the head of any investigation of this nature in which I was deeply interested--just now, at any rate.",m
2470,I am afraid--It is difficult to say.,m
2471,"I do not wish to say too much--I am afraid he is not quite the man for the position.""",m
2472,Ste.,m
2473,Marie nodded his head with great emphasis.,m

2475,"And it's what Hartley felt too, I'm sure.",m
2476,"No, Stewart is not the sort for a detective.",m
2477,He's too cock-sure.,m
2478,He won't admit that he might possibly be wrong now and then.,m
2479,"He's too----""  ""He is too much occupied with other matters,"" said Baron de Vries.",m
2480,Ste.,m

2482,"""Other matters?"" he demanded.",m
2483,"""That sounds mysterious.",m
2484,"What other matters?""",m
2485,"""Oh, there is nothing very mysterious about it,"" said the elder man.",m
2486,He frowned down at his cigarette and brushed some fallen ash neatly from his knees.,m
2487,"""Captain Stewart,"" said he, ""is badly worried, and has been for the past year or so--badly worried over money matters and other things.",m
2488,"He has lost enormous sums at play, as I happen to know; and he has lost still more enormous sums at Auteuil and at Longchamps.",m
2489,"Also the ladies are not without their demands.""",m
2490,Ste.,m
2491,Marie gave a shout of laughter.,m

2493,"""Ce vieillard?""",m
2494,"""Ah well,"" deprecated the other man, ""Vieillard is putting it rather high.",m
2495,"He can't be more than fifty, I should think.",m
2496,"To be sure he looks older, but then, in his day, he lived a great deal in a short time.",m

2529,"""Ah! there,"" said Baron de Vries, ""you enter upon a terra incognita.",m
2530,No one can say what a woman sees in this man or in that.,m
2531,"It's beyond our ken.""",m
2532,"He rose to take his leave, and Ste.",m
2533,Marie went with him to the door.,m
2534,"""I've been asked to a sort of party at Stewart's rooms this week,"" Ste.",m
2535,Marie said.,m
2536,"""I don't know whether I shall go or not.",m
2537,Probably not.,m
2538,"I suppose I shouldn't find Olga Nilssen there?""",m
2539,"""Well, no,"" said the Belgian, laughing.",m
2540,"""No, I hardly think so.",m
2541,Good-bye!,m
2542,Think over what I've told you.,m
2543,"Good-bye!""",m
2544,"He went away down the stair, and Ste.",m
2545,Marie returned to his unpacking.,m
2546,Nothing more of consequence occurred in the next few days.,m
2547,"Hartley had unearthed a somewhat shabby adventurer, who swore to having seen the Irishman, O'Hara, in Paris within a month, but it was by no means certain that this being did not merely affirm what he believed to be desired of him, and in any case the information was of no especial value, since it was O'Hara's present whereabouts that was the point at issue.",m
2548,So it came to Thursday evening.,m
2549,Ste.,m
2550,"Marie received a note from Captain Stewart during the day, reminding him that he was to come to the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
2551,"Honore that evening, and asking him to come early, at ten or thereabouts, so that the two could have a comfortable chat before any one else turned up.",m
2552,Ste.,m
2553,"Marie had about decided not to go at all, but the courtesy of this special invitation from Miss Benham's uncle made it rather impossible for him to stay away.",m
2554,"He tried to persuade Hartley to follow him later on in the evening, but that gentleman flatly refused, and went away to dine with some English friends at Armenonville.",m
2555,So Ste.,m
2556,"Marie, in a vile temper, dined quite alone at Lavenue's, beside the Gare Montparnasse, and towards ten o'clock drove across the river to the Rue du Faubourg.",m
2557,"Captain Stewart's flat was up five stories, at the top of the building in which it was located, and so well above the noises of the street.",m
2558,Ste.,m
2559,"Marie went up in the automatic lift, and at the door above his host met him in person, saying that the one servant he kept was busy making preparations in the kitchen beyond.",m
2560,"They entered a large room, long but comparatively shallow, in shape not unlike the sitting-room in the Rue d'Assas but very much bigger, and Ste.",m
2561,"Marie uttered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure, for he had never before seen an interior anything like this.",m
2562,The room was decorated and furnished entirely in Chinese and Japanese articles of great age and remarkable beauty.,m
2563,Ste.,m
2564,"Marie knew little of the hieratic art of these two countries, but he fancied that the place must be an endless delight to the expert.",m
2565,"The general tone of the room was gold, dulled and softened by great age until it had ceased to glitter, and relieved by the dusty Chinese blue, and by old red faded to rose, and by warm ivory tints.",m
2566,"The great expanse of the walls was covered by a brownish-yellow cloth, coarse, like burlap, and against it round the room hung sixteen large panels representing the sixteen Rakan.",m
2567,"They were early copies--fifteenth century, Captain Stewart said--of those famous originals by the Chinese Sung master Ririomin, which have been for six hundred years or more the treasures of Japan.",m
2568,"They were mounted upon Japanese brocade of blue and dull gold, framed in keyaki wood, and, out of their brown time-stained shadows, the great Rakan scowled or grinned or placidly gazed, grotesquely graceful masterpieces of a perished art.",m
2569,"At the far end of the room, under a gilded canopy of intricate wood-carving, stood upon his pedestal of many-petalled lotus a great statue of Amida Buddha in the yogi attitude of contemplation, and at intervals against the other walls other smaller images stood or sat;",m
2570,Buddha in many incarnations;,m
2571,"Kwannon, Goddess of Mercy;",m
2572,Jizo Bosatzu;,m
2573,"Hotei, pot-bellied, God of Contentment;",m
2574,"Jingo-Kano, God of War.",m
2575,"In the centre of the place was a Buddhist temple table; and priests' chairs, lacquered and inlaid, stood about the room.",m
2576,"The floor was covered by Chinese rugs, dull yellow with blue flowers; and over a doorway which led into another room was fixed a huge rama of Chinese pierced carving, gilded, in which there were trees and rocks and little grouped figures of the hundred immortals.",m
2577,It was indeed an extraordinary room.,m
2578,Ste.,m
2579,"Marie looked about its mellow glow with a half-comprehending wonder, and he looked at the man beside him curiously, for here was another side to this many-sided character.",m
2580,Captain Stewart smiled.,m
2581,"""You like my museum?"" he asked.",m
2582,"""Few people care much for it except, of course, those who go in for the Oriental arts.",m
2583,Most of my friends think it bizarre--too grotesque and unusual.,m
2584,"I have tried to satisfy them by including those comfortable low divan couches (they refuse altogether to sit in the priests' chairs), but still they are unhappy.""",m
2585,"He called his servant, who came to take Ste.",m
2586,"Marie's hat and coat, and returned with smoking things.",m
2587,"""It seems entirely wonderful to me,"" said the younger man.",m
2588,"""I'm not an expert at all--I don't know who the gentlemen in those sixteen panels are, for example; but it is very beautiful.",m
2589,"I have never seen anything like it at all.""",m
2590,He gave a little laugh.,m
2591,"""Will it sound very impertinent in me, I wonder, if I express surprise--not surprise at finding this magnificent room, but at discovering that this sort of thing is a taste and, very evidently, a serious study of yours?",m
2592,"You--I remember your saying once with some feeling that it was youth and beauty and--well, freshness that you liked best to be surrounded by.",m
2593,"This,"" said Ste.",m
2594,"Marie, waving an inclusive hand, ""was young so many centuries ago!",m
2595,"It fairly breathes antiquity and death.""",m
2596,"""Yes,"" said Captain Stewart thoughtfully.",m
2597,"""Yes, that is quite true.""",m
2598,The two had seated themselves upon one of the broad low benches which had been built into the place to satisfy the philistine.,m
2599,"""I find it hard to explain,"" he said, ""because both things are passions of mine.",m
2600,Youth--I could not exist without it.,m
2601,"Since I have it no longer in my own body, I wish to see it about me.",m
2602,It gives me life.,m
2603,It keeps my heart beating.,m
2604,I must have it near.,m
2605,"And then this--antiquity and death, beautiful things made by hands dead centuries ago in an alien country!",m
2606,I love this too.,m
2607,"I didn't speak too strongly, it is a sort of passion with me--something quite beyond the collector's mania, quite beyond that.",m
2608,"Sometimes, do you know, I stay at home in the evening, and I sit here quite alone with the lights half on and, for hours together, I smoke and watch these things--the quiet, sure, patient smile of that Buddha for example.",m
2609,"Think how long he has been smiling like that, and waiting!",m
2610,Waiting for what?,m
2611,"There is something mysterious beyond all words in that smile of his, that fixed, crudely carved wooden smile.",m
2612,"No, I'll be hanged if it's crude!",m
2613,It is beyond our modern art.,m
2614,The dead men carved better than we do.,m
2615,We couldn't manage that with such simple means.,m
2616,We can only reproduce what is before us.,m
2617,"We can't carve questions--mysteries--everlasting riddles.""",m
2618,Through the pale blue wreathing smoke of his cigarette Captain Stewart gazed down the room to where Eternal Buddha stood and smiled eternally.,m
2619,"And from there the man's eyes moved with slow enjoyment along the opposite wall over those who sat or stood there, over the panels of the ancient Rakan, over carved lotus and gilt contorted dragon for ever in pursuit of the holy pearl.",m
2620,"He drew a short breath which seemed to bespeak extreme contentment, the keenest height of pleasure, and he stirred a little where he sat and settled himself among the cushions.",m
2621,Ste.,m
2622,"Marie watched him, and the expression of the man's face began to be oddly revolting.",m
2623,It was the face of a voluptuary in the presence of his desire.,m
2624,"He was uncomfortable and wished to say something to break the silence, but, as often occurs at such a time, he could think of nothing to say.",m
2625,So there was a brief silence between them.,m
2626,But presently Captain Stewart roused himself with an obvious effort.,m
2627,"""Here! this won't do,"" said he, in a tone of whimsical apology.",m
2628,"""This won't do, you know.",m
2629,I'm floating off on my hobby (and there's a mixed metaphor that would do credit to your own Milesian blood!),m
2630,"I'm boring you to extinction, and I don't want to do that, for I'm anxious that you should come here again--and often.",m
2631,I should like to have you form the habit.,m
2632,"""What was it I had in mind to ask you about?",m
2633,Ah yes!,m
2634,The journey to Dinard and Deauville.,m
2635,"I am afraid it turned out to be fruitless or you would have let me know.""",m
2636,"""Entirely fruitless,"" said Ste.",m
2637,Marie.,m
2638,"He went on to tell the elder man of his investigation, and of his certainty that no one resembling Arthur Benham had been at either of the two places.",m
2639,"""It's no affair of mine, to be sure,"" he said;",m
2640,"""but I rather suspect that your agent was deceiving you--pretending to have accomplished something by way of making you think he was busy.""",m
2641,Ste.,m
2642,"Marie was so sure the other would immediately disclaim this that he waited for the word, and gave a little smothered laugh when Captain Stewart said promptly--  ""Oh no!",m
2643,No!,m
2644,That is impossible.,m
2645,I have every confidence in that man.,m
2646,He is one of my best.,m
2647,"No, you are mistaken there.",m
2648,"I am more disappointed than you could possibly be over the failure of your efforts, but I am quite sure my man thought he had something worth working upon.",m
2649,"""By the way, I have received another rather curious communication--from Ostend this time.",m
2650,"I will show you the letter, and you may try your luck there if you would care to.""",m
2651,He felt in his pockets and then rose.,m
2652,"""I've left the thing in another coat,"" said he;",m
2653,"""if you will allow me, I'll fetch it.""",m
2654,"But before he had turned away the doorbell rang, and he paused.",m
2655,"""Ah well,"" he said, ""another time.",m
2656,Here are some of my guests.,m
2657,"They have come earlier than I had expected.""",m
2658,"The new arrivals were three very perfectly dressed ladies, one of them an operatic light who chanced not to be singing that evening, and whom Ste.",m
2659,Marie had met before.,m
2660,"The two others were rather difficult of classification, but probably, he thought, ornaments of that mysterious borderland between the two worlds which seems to give shelter to so many people against whose characters nothing definite is known, but whose antecedents and connexions are not made topics of conversation.",m
2661,"The three ladies seemed to be on very friendly terms with Captain Stewart, and greeted him with much noisy delight.",m
2662,"One of the unclassified two, when her host, with a glance towards Ste.",m
2663,"Marie, addressed her formally, seemed inordinately amused, and laughed for a long time.",m
2664,"Within the next hour ten or a dozen other guests had arrived, and they all seemed to know each other very well, and proceeded to make themselves quite at home.",m
2665,Ste.,m
2666,"Marie regarded them with a reflective and not over-enthusiastic eye, and he wondered a good deal why he had been asked here to meet them.",m
2667,"He was as far from a prig or a snob as any man could very well be, and he often went to very Bohemian parties which were given by his painter or musician friends, but these people seemed to him quite different.",m
2668,"The men, with the exception of two eminent opera singers, who quite obviously had been asked because of their voices, were the sort of men who abound at such places as Ostend and Monte Carlo, and Baden Baden in the race week.",m
2669,"That is not to say that they were ordinary racing touts or the cheaper kind of adventurers: there was a count among them, and a marquis who had recently been divorced by his American wife; but adventurers of a sort they undoubtedly were.",m
2670,"There was not one of them, so far as Ste.",m
2671,"Marie was aware, who was received anywhere in good society, and he resented very much being compelled to meet them.",m
2672,Naturally enough he felt much less concern on the score of the ladies.,m
2673,"It is an undoubted and wellnigh universal truth that men who would refuse outright to meet certain classes of their own sex show no reluctance whatever over meeting the women of a corresponding circle--that is, if the women are attractive.",m
2674,"It is a depressing fact, and inclines one to sighs and head-shakes and some moral indignation, until the reverse truth is brought to light: namely, that women have identically the same point of view; that while they cast looks of loathing and horror upon certain of their sisters, they will meet with pleasure any presentable man whatever his crimes or vices.",m
2675,Ste.,m
2676,Marie was very much puzzled over all this.,m
2677,"It seemed to him so unnecessary that a man who really had some footing in the newer society of Paris should choose to surround himself with people of this type; but, as he looked on and wondered, he became aware of a curious and, in the light of a past conversation, significant fact.",m
2678,"All of the people in the room were young, all of them in their varying fashions and degrees very attractive to look upon, all full to overflowing of life and spirits and the determination to have a good time.",m
2679,"He saw Captain Stewart moving among them, playing very gracefully his role of host, and the man seemed to have dropped twenty years from his shoulders.",m
2680,"A miracle of rejuvenation seemed to have come upon him; his eyes were bright and eager, the colour was high in his cheeks, and the dry pedantic tone had gone from his voice.",m
2681,Ste.,m
2682,"Marie watched him, and at last he thought he understood.",m
2683,"It was half revolting, half pathetic, he thought, but it certainly was interesting to see.",m
2684,"Duval, the great basso of the Opera, accompanied at the piano by one of the unclassified ladies, was just finishing Mefistofele's drinking song out of Faust when the door-bell rang.                                                         The music of voice and piano was very loud just then, so that the little soft whirring sound of the electric bell reached only one or two pairs of ears in the big room.",m
2685,"It did not reach the host certainly, and neither he nor most of the others observed the servant make his way among the groups of seated or standing people and go to the outer door, which opened upon a tiny hallway.",m
2686,"The song came to an end, and everybody was cheering and applauding and crying bravo or bis, or one of the other things that people shout at such times, when, as if in unexpected answer to the outburst, a lady appeared between the yellow portieres, and came forward a little way into the room.",m
2687,"She was a tall lady of an extraordinary and immediately noticeable grace of movement, a lady with rather fair hair, but her eyebrows and lashes had been stained darker than it was their nature to be.",m
2688,"She had the classic Greek type of face--and figure too--all but the eyes, which were long and narrow, narrow perhaps from a habit of going half closed; and when they were a little more than half closed, they made a straight black line that turned up very slightly at the outer end with an Oriental effect, which went oddly in that classic face.",m
2689,"There is a very popular piece of sculpture now in the Luxembourg Gallery for which this lady ""sat"" as model to a great artist.",m
2690,"Sculptors from all over the world go there to dream over its perfect line and contour, and little schoolgirls pretend not to see it, and middle-aged maiden tourists with red Baedeckers in their hands regard it furtively, and pass on, and after awhile come back to look again.",m
2691,"The lady was dressed in some close clinging material, which was not cloth-of-gold but something very like it, only much duller--something which gleamed when she stirred but did not glitter; and over her splendid shoulders was hung an Oriental scarf heavily worked with metallic gold.",m
2692,She made an amazing and dramatic picture in that golden room.,m
2693,It was as if she had known just what her surroundings would be and had dressed expressly for them.,m
2694,"The applause ceased as suddenly as if it had been trained to break off at a signal, and the lady came forward a little way, smiling a quiet assured smile.",m
2695,"At each step her knee threw out the golden stuff of her gown an inch or two, and it flashed suddenly a dull subdued flash in the overhead light, and died and flashed again.",m
2696,"A few of the people in the room knew who the lady was, and they looked at one another with raised eyebrows and startled faces; but the others stared at her with an eager admiration, thinking that they had seldom seen anything so beautiful or so effective.",m
2697,Ste.,m
2698,Marie sat forward on the edge of his chair.,m
2699,"His eyes sparkled, and he gave a little quick sigh of pleasurable excitement.",m
2700,"This was drama and very good drama too, and he suspected that it might at any moment turn into a tragedy.",m
2701,"He saw Captain Stewart, who had been among a group of people halfway across the room, turn his head to look, when the cries and the applause ceased so suddenly, and he saw the man's face stiffen by swift degrees, all the joyous buoyant life gone out of it, until it was yellow and rigid like a dead man's face; and Ste.",m
2702,"Marie, out of his knowledge of the relations between these two people, nodded, en connaisseur, for he knew that the man was very badly frightened.",m
2703,"So the host of the evening hung back staring for what must have seemed to him a long and terrible time, though in reality it was but an instant; then he came forward quickly to greet the newcomer; and if his face was still yellow-white, there was nothing in his manner but the courtesy habitual with him.",m
2704,He took the lady's hand and she smiled at him; but her eyes did not smile: they were hard.,m
2705,Ste.,m
2706,"Marie, who was the nearest of the others, heard Captain Stewart say--  ""This is an unexpected pleasure, my dearest Olga!""",m
2707,"And to that the lady replied more loudly--  ""Yes, I returned to Paris only to-day.",m
2708,"You didn't know, of course.",m
2709,"I heard you were entertaining this evening and so I came, knowing that I should be welcome.""",m
2710,"""Always!"" said Captain Stewart.",m
2711,"""Always more than welcome!""",m
2712,"He nodded to one or two of the men who stood near, and, when they had approached, presented them.",m
2713,Ste.,m
2714,"Marie observed that he used the lady's true name--she had, at times, found occasion to employ others--and that he politely called her ""Madame Nilssen"" instead of ""Mademoiselle.""",m
2715,But at that moment the lady caught sight of Ste.,m
2716,"Marie, and, crying out his name in a tone of delighted astonishment, turned away from the other men, brushing past them as if they had been furniture, and advanced, holding out both her hands in greeting.",m
2717,"""Dear Ste.",m
2718,"Marie!"" she exclaimed.",m
2719,"""Fancy finding you here!",m
2720,I'm so glad!,m
2721,"Oh, I'm so very glad!",m
2722,Take me away from these people!,m
2723,Find a corner where we can talk.,m
2724,Ah! there is one with a big seat.,m
2725,"Allons-y!""",m
2726,"She addressed him for the most part in English, which she spoke perfectly--as perfectly as she spoke French and German and, presumably, her native tongue, which must have been Swedish.",m
2727,"They went to the broad low seat, a sort of hard-cushioned bench, which stood against one of the walls, and made themselves comfortable there by the only possible means, which, owing to the width of the thing, was to sit far back with their feet stuck straight out before them.",m
2728,"Captain Stewart had followed them across the room, and showed a strong tendency to remain.",m
2729,Ste.,m
2730,"Marie observed that his eyes were hard and bright and very alert, and that there were two bright spots of colour in his yellow cheeks.",m
2731,It occurred to Ste.,m
2732,"Marie that the man was afraid to leave him alone with Olga Nilssen, and he smiled to himself, reflecting that the lady, even if indiscreetly inclined, could tell him nothing--save in details--that he did not already know.",m
2733,"But, after a few rather awkward moments, Mlle.",m
2734,Nilssen waved an irritated hand.,m
2735,"""Go away!"" she said to her host.",m
2736,"""Go away to your other guests!",m
2737,I want to talk to Ste.,m
2738,Marie.,m
2739,"We have old times to talk over.""",m
2740,"And after hesitating awhile uneasily, Captain Stewart turned back into the room; but for some time thereafter Ste.",m
2741,"Marie was aware that a vigilant eye was being kept upon them, and that their host was by no means at his ease.",m
2742,"When they were left alone together, the girl turned to him and patted his arm affectionately.",m
2743,"She said--  ""Ah, but it is very good to see you again, mon cher ami!",m
2744,"It has been so long!""",m
2745,She gave an abrupt frown.,m
2746,"""What are you doing here?"" she demanded.",m
2747,And she said an unkind thing about her fellow-guests.,m
2748,She called them canaille.,m
2749,"She said--  ""Why are you wasting your time among these canaille?",m
2750,This is not a place for you.,m
2751,"Why did you come?""",m
2752,"""I don't know,"" said Ste.",m
2753,Marie.,m
2754,He was still a little resentful and he said so.,m
2755,"He said--  ""I didn't know it was going to be like this.",m
2756,I came because Stewart went rather out of his way to ask me.,m
2757,"I'd known him in a very different milieu.""",m
2758,"""Ah yes!"" she said reflectively.",m
2759,"""Yes, he does go into the world also, doesn't he!",m
2760,"But this is what he likes, you know.""",m
2761,"Her lips drew back for an instant and she said--  ""He is a pig-dog.""",m
2762,Ste.,m
2763,Marie looked at her gravely.,m
2764,She had used that offensive name with a little too much fierceness.,m
2765,"Her face had turned for an instant quite white, and her eyes had flashed out over the room a look that meant a great deal to any one who knew her as well as Ste.",m
2766,Marie did.,m
2767,He sat forward and lowered his voice.,m
2768,"He said--  ""Look here, Olga!",m
2769,I'm going to be very frank for a moment.,m
2770,"May I?""",m
2771,"For just an instant the girl drew away from him with suspicion in her eyes, and something else, alertly defiant.",m
2772,Then she put out her hands to his arm.,m
2773,"""You may be what you like, dear Ste.",m
2774,"Marie,"" she said.",m
2775,"""And say what you like.",m
2776,I will take it all--and swallow it alive--good as gold.,m
2777,"What are you going to do to me?""",m
2778,"""I've always been fair with you, haven't I?"" he urged.",m
2779,"""I've had disagreeable things to say or do but--you knew always that I liked you and--where my sympathies were.""",m
2780,"""Always!",m
2781,"Always, mon cher!"" she cried.",m
2782,"""I trusted you always in everything.",m
2783,And there is no one else I trust.,m
2784,No one!,m
2785,No one!,m
2786,"""Ste.",m
2787,"Marie!""",m
2788,"""What then?"" he asked.",m
2789,"""Ste.",m
2790,"Marie,"" she said, ""why did you never fall in love with me, as the other men did?""",m
2791,"""I wonder,"" said he.",m
2792,"""I don't know.",m
2793,"Upon my word, I really don't know.""",m
2794,He was so serious about it that the girl burst into a shriek of laughter.,m
2795,And in the end he laughed too.,m
2796,"""I expect it was because I liked you too well,"" he said at last.",m
2797,"""But come!",m
2798,We're forgetting my lecture.,m
2799,Listen to your grandpere Ste.,m
2800,Marie!,m
2801,I have heard--certain things--rumours--what you will.,m
2802,"Perhaps they are foolish lies, and I hope they are.",m
2803,"But if not, if the fear I saw in Stewart's face when you came here to-night was--not without cause, let me beg you to have a care.",m
2804,"You're much too savage, my dear child.",m
2805,"Don't be so foolish as to--well, turn comedy into the other thing.",m
2806,"In the first place it's not worth while, and in the second place it recoils, always.",m
2807,Revenge may be sweet.,m
2808,I don't know.,m
2809,"But nowadays, with police courts and all that, it entails much more subsequent annoyance that it is worth.",m
2810,"Be wise, Olga!""",m
2811,"""Some things, Ste.",m
2812,"Marie,"" said the golden lady, ""are worth all the consequences that may follow them.""",m
2813,"She watched Captain Stewart across the room where he stood chatting with a little group of people, and her beautiful face was as hard as marble, and her eyes were as dark as a stormy night, and her mouth, for an instant, was almost like an animal's mouth, cruel and relentless.",m
2814,Ste.,m
2815,"Marie saw, and he began to be a bit alarmed in good earnest.",m
2816,"In his warning he had spoken rather more seriously than he felt the occasion demanded, but he began at last to wonder if the occasion was not in reality very serious indeed.",m
2817,"He was sure, of course, that Olga Nilssen had come here on this evening to annoy Captain Stewart in some fashion.",m
2818,"As he put it to himself, she probably meant to ""make a row,"" and he would not have been in the least surprised if she had made it in the beginning upon her very dramatic entrance.",m
2819,Nothing more calamitous than that had occurred to him.,m
2820,"But when he saw the woman's face, turned a little away and gazing fixedly at Captain Stewart, he began to be aware that there was tragedy very near him, or all the makings of it.",m
2821,Mlle.,m
2822,Nilssen turned back to him.,m
2823,"Her face was still hard, and her eyes dark and narrowed, with their oddly Oriental look.",m
2824,"She bent her shoulders together for an instant, and her hands moved slowly in her lap, stretching out before her, in a gesture very like a cat's when it wakens from sleep and yawns and extends its claws, as if to make sure that they are still there and ready for use.",m
2825,"""I feel a little like Samson to-night,"" she said.",m
2826,"""I am tired of almost everything, and I should like very much to pull the world down on top of me and kill everybody in it--except you, Ste.",m
2827,"Marie, dear!",m
2828,"Except you!--and be crushed under the ruins.""",m
2829,"""I think,"" said Ste.",m
2830,"Marie practically--and the speech sounded rather like one of Hartley's speeches--""I think it was not quite the world that Samson pulled down, but a temple--or a palace--something of that kind.""",m
2831,"""Well,"" said the golden lady, ""this place is rather like a temple--a Chinese temple, with the pig-dog for high priest.""",m
2832,Ste.,m
2833,Marie frowned at her.,m
2834,"""What are you going to do?"" he demanded sharply.",m
2835,"""What did you come here to do?",m
2836,"Mischief of some kind--bien entendu--but what?""",m
2837,"""Do?"" she said, looking at him with her narrowed eyes.",m
2838,"""I?",m
2839,"Why, what should I do?",m
2840,"Nothing, of course!",m
2841,I merely said I should like to pull the place down.,m
2842,"Of course I couldn't do that quite literally, now, could I?",m
2843,No.  It is merely a mood.,m
2844,"I'm not going to do anything.""",m
2845,"""You're not being honest with me,"" he said.",m
2846,"And at that her expression changed, and she patted his arm again with a gesture that seemed to beg forgiveness.",m
2847,"""Well then,"" she said, ""if you must know, maybe I did come here for a purpose.",m
2848,I want to have it out with our friend Captain Stewart about something.,m
2849,"""And Ste.",m
2850,"Marie, dear,"" she pleaded, ""please, I think you'd better go home first.",m
2851,"I don't care about these other animals, but I don't want you dragged into any row of any sort.",m
2852,"Please, be a sweet Ste.",m
2853,Marie and go home.,m
2854,"Yes?""",m
2855,"""Absolutely, no!"" said Ste.",m
2856,Marie.,m
2857,"""I shall stay, and I shall try my utmost to prevent you from doing anything foolish.",m
2858,Understand that!,m
2859,"If you want to have rows with people, Olga, for Heaven's sake don't pick an occasion like this for the purpose.",m
2860,"Have your rows in private!""",m
2861,"""I rather think I enjoy an audience,"" she said with a reflective air, and Ste.",m
2862,Marie laughed aloud because he knew that the naive speech was so very true.,m
2863,"This lady, with her many good qualities and her bad ones--not a few, alas!--had an undeniable passion for red fire that had amused him very much on more than one past occasion.",m
2864,"""Please, go home!"" she said once more.",m
2865,"But when the man only shook his head, she raised her hands a little way and dropped them again in her lap in an odd gesture, which seemed to say that she had done all she could do, and that if anything disagreeable should happen now, and he should be involved in it, it would be entirely his fault because she had warned him.",m
2866,Then quite abruptly a mood of irresponsible gaiety seemed to come upon her.,m
2867,"She refused to have anything more to do with serious topics, and when Ste Marie attempted to introduce them she laughed in his face.",m
2868,"As she had said in the beginning she wished to do, she harked back to old days--the earlier stages of what might be termed the Morrison regime, and it seemed to afford her great delight to recall the happenings of that epoch.",m
2869,"The conversation became a dialogue of reminiscence which would have been entirely unintelligible to a third person, and was indeed so to Captain Stewart, who once came across the room, made a feeble effort to attach himself, and presently wandered away again.",m
2870,"They unearthed from the past an exceedingly foolish song all about one ""Little Willie"" and a purple monkey climbing up a yellow stick.",m
2871,"It was set to a well-known air from Don Giovanni, and when Duval, the basso heard them singing it, he came up and insisted upon knowing what it was about.",m
2872,"He laughed immoderately over the English words when he was told what they meant, and made Ste.",m
2873,Marie write them down for him on two visiting cards.,m
2874,"So they made a trio out of ""Little Willie,"" the great Duval inventing a bass part quite marvellous in its ingenuity, and they were compelled to sing it over, and over again, until Ste.",m
2875,"Marie's falsetto imitation of a tenor voice cracked and gave out altogether, since he was by nature baritone, if anything at all.",m
2876,"The other guests had crowded round to hear the extraordinary song, and when the song was at last finished several of them remained, so that Ste.",m
2877,Marie saw he was to be allowed an uninterrupted tete-a-tete with Olga Nilssen no longer.,m
2878,"He therefore drifted away, after a few moments, and went with Duval and one of the other men across the room to look at some small jade objects--snuff-bottles, bracelets, buckles and the like--which were displayed in a cabinet cleverly reconstructed out of a Japanese shrine.",m
2879,It was perhaps ten minutes later when he looked round the place and discovered that neither Mlle.,m
2880,Nilssen nor Captain Stewart were to be seen.,m
2881,"His first thought was of relief, for he said to himself that the two had sensibly gone into one of the other rooms to ""have it out"" in peace and quiet.",m
2882,But following that came the recollection of the woman's face when she had watched her host across the room.,m
2883,"Her words came back to him: ""I feel a little like Samson to-night....",m
2884,"I should very much like to pull the world down on top of me and kill everybody in it.""",m
2885,Ste.,m
2886,Marie thought of these things and he began to be uncomfortable.,m
2887,"He found himself watching the yellow-hung doorway beyond, with its intricate Chinese carving of trees and rocks and little groups of immortals, and he found that unconsciously he was listening for something--he did not know what--above the chatter and laughter of the people in the room.",m
2888,"He endured this for possibly five minutes, and all at once found that he could endure it no longer.",m
2889,He began to make his way quietly through the group of people towards the curtained doorway.,m
2890,As he went one of the women near by complained in a loud tone that the servant had disappeared.,m
2891,"She wanted, it seemed, a glass of water having already had many glasses of more interesting things.",m
2892,Ste.,m
2893,Marie said he would get it for her and went on his way.,m
2894,He had an excuse now.,m
2895,"He found himself in a square dimly lighted room, much smaller than the other.",m
2896,There was a round table in the centre so he thought it must be Stewart's dining-room.,m
2897,"At the left a doorway opened into a place where there were lights, and at the other side was another door closed.",m
2898,"From the room at the left there came a sound of voices, and though they were not loud, one of them, Mlle.",m
2899,"Olga Nilssen's voice, was hard and angry and not altogether under control.",m
2900,"The man would seem to have been attempting to pacify her, and he would seem not to have been very successful.",m
2901,The first words that Ste.,m
2902,Marie was able to distinguish were from the woman.,m
2903,"She said in a low fierce tone--  ""That is a lie, my friend!",m
2904,That is a lie.,m
2905,"I know all about the road to Clamart, so you needn't lie to me any longer.",m
2906,"It's no good.""",m
2907,"She paused for just an instant there, and, in the pause, Ste.",m
2908,Marie heard Stewart give a sort of inarticulate exclamation.,m
2909,It seemed to express anger and it seemed also to express fear.,m
2910,But the woman swept on and her voice began to be louder.,m
2911,"She said--  ""I've given you your chance.",m
2912,"You didn't deserve it, but I've given it you--and you've told me nothing but lies.",m
2913,"Well, you'll lie no more.",m
2914,"This ends it.""",m
2915,Upon that Ste.,m
2916,Marie heard a sudden stumbling shuffle of feet and a low hoarse cry of utter terror--a cry more animal-like than human.,m
2917,"He heard the cry break off abruptly in something that was like a cough and a whine together, and he heard the sound of a heavy body falling with a loose rattle upon the floor.",m
2918,With the sound of that falling body he had already reached the doorway and torn aside the heavy portiere.,m
2919,"It was a sleeping-room he looked into, a room of medium size, with two windows and an ornate bed of the Empire style set sidewise against the farther wall.",m
2920,There were electric lights upon imitation candles which were grouped in sconces against the walls and these were turned on so that the room was brightly illuminated.,m
2921,"Midway between the door and the ornate Empire bed Captain Stewart lay huddled and writhing upon the floor, and Olga Nilssen stood upright beside him, gazing down upon him quite calmly.",m
2922,"In her right hand, which hung at her side, she held a little flat black automatic pistol of the type known as Brownings, and they look toys but they are not.",m
2923,"[Illustration: ""Captain Stewart lay huddled and writhing upon the floor.""]  Ste.",m
2924,"Marie sprang at her silently and caught her by the arm, twisting the automatic pistol from her grasp, and the woman made no effort whatever to resist him.",m
2925,"She looked into his face quite frankly and unmoved, and she shook her head.",m
2926,"""I haven't harmed him,"" she said.",m
2927,"""I was going to, yes.",m
2928,"And then myself, but he didn't give me a chance.",m
2929,"He fell down in a fit.""",m
2930,"She nodded down towards the man, who lay writhing at their feet.",m
2931,"""I frightened him,"" she said, ""and he fell in a fit.",m
2932,"He's an epileptic, you know.",m
2933,Didn't you know that?,m
2934,"Oh yes.""",m
2935,"Abruptly she turned away shivering, and put up her hands over her face.",m
2936,And she gave an exclamation of uncontrollable repulsion.,m
2937,"""Ugh!"" she cried, ""it's horrible.",m
2938,Horrible!,m
2939,I can't bear to look.,m
2940,I saw him in a fit once before--long ago--and I couldn't bear even to speak to him for a month.,m
2941,I thought he had been cured.,m
2942,"He said---- Ah, it's horrible!""",m
2943,Ste.,m
2944,"Marie had dropped upon his knees beside the fallen man, and Mlle.",m
2945,"Nilssen said over her shoulder--  ""Hold his head up from the floor, if you can bear to.",m
2946,"He might hurt it.""",m
2947,"It was not an easy thing to do, for Ste.",m
2948,"Marie had the natural sense of repulsion in such matters that most people have, and this man's appearance, as Olga Nilssen had said, was horrible.",m
2949,"The face was drawn hideously, and, in the strong clear light of the electrics, it was a deathly yellow.",m
2950,"The eyes were half closed, and the eyeballs turned up so that only the whites of them showed between the lids.",m
2951,"There was froth upon the distorted mouth, and it clung to the cat-like moustache and to the shallow sunken chin beneath.",m
2952,But Ste.,m
2953,"Marie exerted all his will power, and took the jerking trembling head in his hands, holding it clear of the floor.",m
2954,"""You'd better call the servant,"" he said.",m
2955,"""There may be something that can be done.""",m
2956,"But the woman answered, without looking--  ""No, there's nothing that can be done, I believe, except to keep him from bruising himself.",m
2957,"Stimulants--that sort of thing, do more harm than good.",m
2958,"Could you get him on the bed here?""",m
2959,"""Together we might manage it,"" said Ste.",m
2960,Marie.,m
2961,"""Come and help!""",m
2962,"""I can't!"" she cried nervously.",m
2963,"""I can't--touch him.",m
2964,"Please, I can't do it.""",m
2965,"""Come!"" said the man in a sharp tone.",m
2966,"""It's no time for nerves.",m
2967,"I don't like it either, but it's got to be done.""",m
2968,"The woman began a half-hysterical sobbing, but after a moment she turned and came with slow feet to where Stewart lay.",m
2969,Ste.,m
2970,Marie slipped his arms under the man's body and began to raise him from the floor.,m
2971,"""You needn't help after all,"" he said.",m
2972,"""He's not heavy.""",m
2973,"And indeed, under his skilfully shaped and padded clothes, the man was a mere waif of a man--as unbelievably slight as if he were the victim of a wasting disease.",m
2974,Ste.,m
2975,"Marie held the body in his arms as if it had been a child, and carried it across and laid it on the bed; but it was many months before he forgot the horror of that awful thing, shaking and twitching in his hold, the head thumping hideously upon his shoulder, the arms and legs beating against him.",m
2976,It was the most difficult task he had ever had to perform.,m
2977,He laid Captain Stewart upon the bed and straightened the helpless limbs as best he could.,m
2978,"""I suppose,"" he said, rising again, ""I suppose when the man comes out of this he'll be frightfully exhausted and drop off to sleep, won't he?",m
2979,"We'll have to----""  He halted abruptly there and, for a single swift instant, he felt the black and rushing sensation of one who is going to faint away.",m
2980,"The wall behind the ornate Empire bed was covered with photographs, some in frames, others left as they had been received upon the large squares of weird cardboard which are termed ""art mounts.""",m
2981,"""Come here a moment, quickly!"" said Ste.",m
2982,Marie in a sharp voice.,m
2983,Mlle.,m
2984,"Nilssen's sobs had died down to a silent spasmodic catching of the breath, but she was still much unnerved, and she approached the bed with obvious unwillingness, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.",m
2985,Ste.,m
2986,"Marie pointed to an unframed photograph which was fastened to the wall by thumb tacks, and his outstretched hand shook as he pointed.",m
2987,Beneath them the other man still writhed and tumbled in his epileptic fit.,m
2988,"""Do you know who that woman is?"" demanded Ste.",m
2989,"Marie, and his tone was such that Olga Nilssen turned slowly and stared at him.",m
2990,"""That woman,"" said she, ""is the reason why I wished to pull the world down upon Charlie Stewart and me to-night.",m
2991,"That's who she is.""",m
2992,Ste.,m
2993,Marie gave a sort of cry.,m
2994,"""Who is she?"" he insisted.",m
2995,"""What is her name?",m
2996,I--have a particularly important reason for wanting to know.,m
2997,"I've got to know.""",m
2998,Mlle.,m
2999,"Nilssen shook her head, still staring at him.",m
3000,"""I can't tell you that,"" said she.",m
3001,"""I don't know the name.",m
3002,"I only know that--when he met her, he----  I don't know her name, but I know where she lives and where he goes every day to see her--a house with a big garden and walled park on the road to Clamart.",m
3003,"It's on the edge of the wood, not far from Fort d'Issy.",m
3004,The Clamart-Vanves-Issy tram runs past the wall of one side of the park.,m
3005,"That's all I know.""",m
3006,Ste.,m
3007,Marie clasped his head with his hands.,m
3008,"""So near to it!"" he groaned, ""and yet----  Ah!""",m
3009,"He bent forward suddenly over the bed and spelled out the name of the photographer, which was pencilled upon the brown cardboard mount.",m
3010,"""There's still a chance,"" he said.",m
3011,"""There's still one chance.""",m
3012,"He became aware that the woman was watching him curiously, and nodded to her.",m
3013,"""It's something you don't know about,"" he explained.",m
3014,"""I've got to find out who this--girl is.",m
3015,Perhaps the photographer can help me.,m
3016,"I used to know him.""",m
3017,All at once his eyes sharpened.,m
3018,"""Tell me the simple truth about something!"" said he.",m
3019,"""If ever we have been friends, if you owe me any good office, tell me this!",m
3020,"Do you know anything about young Arthur Benham's disappearance two months ago, or about what has become of him?""",m
3021,Again the woman shook her head.,m
3022,"""No,"" said she.",m
3023,"""Nothing at all.",m
3024,I haven't even heard of it.,m
3025,Young Arthur Benham!,m
3026,I've met him once or twice.,m
3027,I wonder--I wonder Stewart never spoke to me about his disappearance.,m
3028,"That's very odd.""",m
3029,"""Yes,"" said Ste.",m
3030,"Marie absently, ""it is.""",m
3031,He gave a little sigh.,m
3032,"""I wonder about a good many things,"" said he.",m
3033,"He glanced down upon the bed before them, and Captain Stewart lay still, save for a slight twitching of the hands.",m
3034,"Once he moved his head restlessly from side to side, and said something incoherent in a weak murmur.",m
3035,"""He's out of it,"" said Olga Nilssen.",m
3036,"""He'll sleep now, I think.",m
3037,I suppose we must get rid of those people and then leave him to the care of his man.,m
3038,"A doctor couldn't do anything for him.""",m
3039,"""Yes,"" said Ste.",m
3040,"Marie, nodding.",m
3041,"""I'll call the servant and tell the people that Stewart has been taken ill.""",m
3042,"He looked once more towards the photograph on the wall, and under his breath he said with an odd defiant fierceness--  ""I won't believe it!""",m
3043,But he did not explain what he wouldn't believe.,m
3044,"He started out of the room, but, halfway, halted and turned back.",m
3045,"He looked Olga Nilssen full in the eyes, saying--  ""It is safe to leave you here with him while I call the servant?",m
3046,"There'll be no more----?""",m
3047,But the woman gave a low cry and a violent shiver with it.,m
3048,"""You need have no fear,"" she said.",m
3049,"""I've no desire now to--harm him.",m
3050,The--reason is gone.,m
3051,This has cured me.,m
3052,I feel as if I could never bear to see him again.,m
3053,"Oh, hurry!",m
3054,"Please, hurry!",m
3055,"I want to get away from here.""",m
3056,Ste.,m
3057,Marie nodded and went out of the room.                                                      *THE NAME OF THE LADY WITH THE EYES:                        EVIDENCE HEAPS UP SWIFTLY*   Ste.,m
3058,"Marie drove home to the Rue d'Assas with his head in a whirl and with a sense of great excitement beating somewhere within him, probably in the place where his heart ought to be.",m
3059,He had a curiously sure feeling that at last his feet were upon the right path.,m
3060,"He could not have explained this to himself--indeed, there was nothing to explain, and if there had been, he was in far too great an inner turmoil to manage it.",m
3061,"It was a mere feeling--the sort of thing which he had once tried to express to Captain Stewart, and had got laughed at for his pains.",m
3062,"There was, in sober fact, no reason whatever why Captain Stewart's possession of a photograph of the beautiful lady whom Ste.",m
3063,"Marie had once seen in company with O'Hara should be taken as significant of anything except an appreciation of beauty on the part of Miss Benham's uncle--not even if, as Mlle.",m
3064,"Nilssen believed, Captain Stewart was in love with the lady.",m
3065,But to Ste.,m
3066,"Marie, in his whirl of reawakened excitement, the discovery loomed to the skies, and, in a series of ingenious but very vague leaps of the imagination, he saw himself, with the aid of this new evidence (which was no evidence at all, if he had been calm enough to realise it), victorious in his great quest, leading young Arthur Benham back to the arms of an ecstatic family, and kneeling at the feet of that youth's sister to claim his reward.",m
3067,All of which seems a rather startling flight of the imagination to have had its beginning in the sight of one photograph of a young woman.,m
3068,But then Ste.,m
3069,Marie was imaginative if he was anything.,m
3070,"He fell to thinking of this girl whose eyes, after one sight of them, had so long haunted him.",m
3071,"He thought of her between those two men, the hard-faced Irish adventurer and the other, Stewart, strange compound of intellectual and voluptuary, and his eyes flashed in the dark and he gripped his hands together upon his knees.",m
3072,"He said again--  ""I won't believe it!",m
3073,"I won't believe it!""",m
3074,Believe what? one wonders.,m
3075,"He slept hardly at all, only, towards morning, falling into an uneasy doze.",m
3076,"And in the doze he dreamed once more the dream of the dim waste place and the hill, and the eyes and voice that called him back--because they needed him.",m
3077,"As early as he dared, after his morning coffee, he took a fiacre and drove across the river to the Boulevard de la Madeleine, where he climbed a certain stair, at the foot of which were two glass cases containing photographs of, for the most part, well-known ladies of the Parisian stage.",m
3078,"At the top of the stair he entered the reception-room of a young photographer, who is famous now the world over, but who at the beginning of his career, when he had nothing but talent and no acquaintance, owed certain of his most important commissions to M. Ste.",m
3079,Marie.,m
3080,"The man, whose name was Bernstein, came forward eagerly from the studio beyond to greet his visitor, and Ste.",m
3081,"Marie complimented him chaffingly upon his very sleek and prosperous appearance, and upon the new decorations of the little salon, which were, in truth, excellently well judged.",m
3082,"But after they had talked for a little while of such matters he said--  ""I want to know if you keep specimen prints of all the photographs you have made within the last few months, and if so I should like to see them.""",m
3083,The young Jew went to a wooden portfolio holder which stood in a corner and dragged it out into the light.,m
3084,"""I have them all here,"" said he, ""everything that I have made within the past ten or twelve months.",m
3085,"If you will let me draw up a chair you can look them over comfortably.""",m
3086,He glanced at his former patron with a little polite curiosity as Ste.,m
3087,"Marie followed his suggestion, and began to turn over the big portfolio's contents, but he did not show any surprise nor ask questions.",m
3088,Indeed he guessed--to a certain extent--rather near the truth of the matter.,m
3089,"It had happened before that young gentlemen, and old ones too, wanted to look over his prints without offering explanations, and they generally picked out all the photographs there were of some particular lady, and bought them if they could be bought.",m
3090,"So he was by no means astonished on this occasion, and he moved about the room putting things to rights, and even went for a few moments into the studio beyond, until he was recalled by a sudden exclamation from his visitor, an exclamation which had a sound of mingled delight and excitement.",m
3091,Ste.,m
3092,"Marie held in his hands a large photograph, and he turned it towards the man who had made it.",m
3093,"""I am going to ask you some questions,"" said he, ""that will sound rather indiscreet and irregular, but I beg you to answer them if you can, because the matter is of great importance to a number of people.",m
3094,"Do you remember this lady?""",m
3095,"""Oh yes,"" said the Jew readily, ""I remember her very well.",m
3096,"I never forget people who are as beautiful as this lady was.""",m
3097,His eyes gleamed with retrospective joy.,m
3098,"""She was splendid!"" he declared, ""sumptuous!",m
3099,No!,m
3100,I cannot describe her.,m
3101,I have not the words.,m
3102,And I could not photograph her with any justice either.,m
3103,"She was all colour--brown skin with a dull red stain under the cheeks, and a great mass of hair that was not black but very nearly black--except in the sun, and then there were red lights in it.",m
3104,"She was a goddess, that lady, a queen of goddesses: the young Juno before marriage, the----""  ""Yes,"" interrupted Ste.",m
3105,"Marie, ""yes, I see.",m
3106,"Yes, quite evidently she was beautiful, but what I wanted in particular to know was her name, if you feel that you have a right to give it to me (I remind you again that the matter is very important), and any circumstances that you can remember about her coming here; who came with her, for instance, and things of that sort.""",m
3107,"The photographer looked a little disappointed at being cut off in the middle of his rhapsody, but he began turning over the leaves of an order-book which lay upon a table near by.",m
3108,"""Here is the entry!"" he said after a few moments.",m
3109,"""Yes, I thought so, the date was nearly three months ago--April 5.",m
3110,And the lady's name was Mlle.,m
3111,"Coira O'Hara.""",m
3112,"""What?"" cried the other man sharply.",m
3113,"""What did you say?""",m
3114,"""Mlle.",m
3115,"Coira O'Hara was the name,"" repeated the photographer.",m
3116,"""I remember the occasion perfectly.",m
3117,"The lady came here with three gentlemen, one tall thin gentleman with an eyeglass, an Englishman, I think, though he spoke very excellent French when he spoke to me.",m
3118,"Among themselves they spoke, I think, English, though I do not understand it except a few words such as ''ow moch?' and 'sank you' and 'rady pleas' now.'""  ""Yes!",m
3119,"Yes!"" cried Ste.",m
3120,Marie impatiently.,m
3121,"And the little Jew could see that he was labouring under some very strong excitement, and he wondered mildly about it, scenting a love affair.",m
3122,"""Then,"" he pursued, ""there was a very young man in strange clothes, a tourist, I should think, like those Americans and English who come in the summer with little red books and sit on the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix.""",m
3123,"He heard his visitor draw a swift sharp breath at that, but he hurried on before he could be interrupted--  ""This young man seemed to be unable to take his eyes from the lady, and small wonder!",m
3124,"He was very much epris, very much epris indeed.",m
3125,Never have I seen a youth more so.,m
3126,"Ah, it was something to see, that!",m
3127,"A thing to touch the heart.""",m
3128,"""What did the young man look like?"" demanded Ste.",m
3129,Marie.,m
3130,"The photographer described the youth as best he could from memory, and he saw his visitor nod once or twice, and at the end he said: ""Yes, yes, I thought so.",m
3131,"Thank you.""",m
3132,"The Jew did not know what it was the other thought, but he went on--  ""Ah, a thing to touch the heart!",m
3133,Such devotion as that!,m
3134,Alas that the lady should seem so cold to it!,m
3135,"Still, a goddess!",m
3136,What would you?,m
3137,A queen among goddesses.,m
3138,One would not have them laugh and make little jokes--make eyes at lovesick boys.,m
3139,"No indeed!""",m
3140,He shook his head rapidly and sighed.,m
3141,Ste.,m
3142,"Marie was silent for a little space, but at length he looked up as if he had just remembered something.",m
3143,"""And the third man?"" he asked.",m
3144,"""Ah yes, the third gentleman,"" said Bernstein.",m
3145,"""I had forgotten him.",m
3146,The third gentleman I knew well.,m
3147,He had often been here.,m
3148,It was he who brought these friends to me.,m
3149,He was M. le Capitaine Stewart.,m
3150,Everybody knows M. le Capitaine Stewart.,m
3151,"Everybody in Paris.""",m
3152,"Again he observed that his visitor drew a little swift sharp breath, and that he seemed to be labouring under some excitement.",m
3153,"However, Ste.",m
3154,"Marie did not question him further, and so he went on to tell the little more he knew of the matter: how the four people had remained for an hour or more, trying many poses; how they had returned, all but the tall gentleman, three days later to see the proofs, and to order certain ones to be printed--the young man paying on the spot in advance--and how the finished prints had been sent to M. le Capitaine Stewart's address.",m
3155,"When he had finished his visitor sat for a long time silent, his head bent a little, frowning upon the floor and chafing his hands together over his knees.",m
3156,But at last he rose rather abruptly.,m
3157,"He said--  ""Thank you very much indeed.",m
3158,You have done me a great service.,m
3159,If ever I can repay it command me.,m
3160,"Thank you!""",m
3161,"The Jew protested, smiling, that he was still too deeply in debt to M. Ste.",m
3162,"Marie, and so, politely wrangling, they reached the door, and, with a last expression of gratitude, the visitor departed down the stair.",m
3163,A client came in just then for a sitting and so the little photographer did not have an opportunity to wonder over the rather odd affair as much as he might have done.,m
3164,"Indeed, in the press of work, it slipped from his mind altogether.",m
3165,But down in the busy boulevard Ste.,m
3166,Marie stood hesitating on the curb.,m
3167,"There were so many things to be done, in the light of these new developments, that he did not know what to do first.",m
3168,"""Mademoiselle Coira O'Hara!--Mademoiselle!""",m
3169,The thought gave him a sudden sting of inexplicable relief and pleasure.,m
3170,She would be O'Hara's daughter then.,m
3171,"And the boy, Arthur Benham (there was no room for doubt in the photographer's description), had seemed to be badly in love with her.",m
3172,This was a new development indeed!,m
3173,"It wanted thought, reflection, consultation with Richard Hartley.",m
3174,"He signalled to a fiacre, and when it had drawn up before him, sprang into it, and gave Richard Hartley's address in the Avenue de l'Observatoire.",m
3175,"But when they had gone a little way he changed his mind and gave another address, one in the Boulevard de la Tour Maubourg.",m
3176,It was where Mlle.,m
3177,Olga Nilssen lived.,m
3178,She had told him when he parted from her the evening before.,m
3179,"On the way he fell to thinking of what he had learnt from the little photographer Bernstein, to setting the facts, as well as he could, in order, endeavouring to make out just how much or how little they signified, by themselves or added to what he had known before.",m
3180,But he was in far too keen a state of excitement to review them at all calmly.,m
3181,"As on the previous evening they seemed to him to loom to the skies, and again he saw himself successful in his quest--victorious, triumphant.",m
3182,That this leap to conclusions was but a little less absurd than the first did not occur to him.,m
3183,"He was in a fine fever of enthusiasm, and such difficulties as his eye perceived lay in a sort of vague mist, to be dissipated later on, when he should sit quietly down with Hartley, and sift the wheat from the chaff, laying out a definite scheme of action.",m
3184,"It occurred to him that in his interview with the photographer he had forgotten one point, and he determined to go back, later on, and ask about it.",m
3185,He had forgotten to inquire as to Captain Stewart's attitude towards the beautiful lady.,m
3186,"Young Arthur Benham's infatuation had filled his mind at the time, and had driven out of it what Olga Nilssen had told him about Stewart.",m
3187,He found himself wondering if this point might not be one of great importance--the rivalry of the two men for O'Hara's daughter.,m
3188,Assuredly that demanded thought and investigation.,m
3189,"He found the prettily furnished apartment in the Avenue de la Tour Maubourg a scene of great disorder, presided over by a maid, who seemed to be packing enormous quantities of garments into large trunks.",m
3190,"The maid told him that her mistress, after a sleepless night, had departed from Paris by an early train, quite alone, leaving the servant to follow on when she had telegraphed or written an address.",m
3191,"No, Mlle.",m
3192,"Nilssen had left no address at all, not even for letters or telegrams.",m
3193,"In short the entire proceeding was, so the exasperated woman viewed it, everything that is imbecile.",m
3194,Ste.,m
3195,"Marie sat down on a hamper with his stick between his knees, and wrote a little note to be sent on when Mlle.",m
3196,Nilssen's whereabouts should be known.,m
3197,"It was unfortunate, he reflected, that she should have fled away just now, but not of great importance to him, because he did not believe that he could learn very much more from her than he had learnt already.",m
3198,"Moreover, he sympathised with her desire to get away from Paris--as far away as possible from the man whom she had seen in so horrible a state on the evening past.",m
3199,"He had kept the fiacre at the door, and he drove at once back to the Rue d'Assas.",m
3200,"As he started to mount the stair the concierge came out of her loge to say that Mr. Hartley had called soon after monsieur had left the house that morning, had seemed very much disappointed on not finding monsieur, and before going away again had had himself let into monsieur's apartment with the key of the femme de menage, and had written a note which monsieur would find, la haut.",m
3201,Ste.,m
3202,"Marie thanked the woman and went on up to his rooms, wondering why Hartley had bothered to leave a note instead of waiting or returning at lunch-time as he usually did.",m
3203,He found the communication on his table and read it at once.,m
3204,"Hartley said--   ""I have to go across the river to the Bristol to see some relatives who are turning up there to-day, and who will probably keep me until evening, and then I shall have to go back there to dine.",m
3205,So I'm leaving a word for you about some things I discovered last evening.,m
3206,"I met Miss Benham at Armenonville, where I dined, and in a tete-a-tete conversation we had after dinner she let fall two facts which seem to me very important.",m
3207,"They concern Captain S. In the first place, when he told us that day, some time ago, that he knew nothing about his father's will or any changes that might have been made in it, he lied.",m
3208,"It seems that old David, shortly after the boy's disappearance, being very angry at what he considered, and still considers, a bit of spite on the boy's part, cut young Arthur Benham out of his will and transferred that share to Captain S.  (Miss Benham learnt this from the old man only yesterday).",m
3209,"Also it appears that he did this after talking the matter over with Captain S., who affected unwillingness.",m
3210,"So, as the will reads now, Miss B. and Captain S. stand to share equally the bulk of the old man's money, which is several millions (in dols. of course);",m
3211,Miss B.'s mother is to have the interest of half of both shares as long as she lives.,m
3212,Now mark this!,m
3213,"Prior to this new arrangement Captain S. was to receive only a small legacy, on the ground that he already had a respectable fortune left him by his mother, old David's first wife.",m
3214,"(I've heard, by the way, that he has squandered a good share of what he had.)",m
3215,"""Miss B. is, of course, much cut up over this injustice to the boy, but she can't protest too much as it only excites old David--she says the old man is much weaker.",m
3216,"""You see, of course, the significance of all this.",m
3217,"If David Stewart dies, as he's likely to do, before young Arthur's return, Captain S. gets the money.",m
3218,"""The second fact I learnt was that Miss Benham did not tell her uncle about her semi-engagement to you or about your volunteering to search for the boy.",m
3219,She thinks her grandfather must have told him.,m
3220,"I didn't say so to her, but that is hardly possible in view of the fact that Stewart came on here to your rooms very soon after you had reached them yourself.",m
3221,"""So that makes two lies for our gentle friend, and serious lies, both of them.",m
3222,To my mind they point unmistakably to a certain conclusion.,m
3223,Captain S. has been responsible for putting his nephew out of the way.,m
3224,"He has either hidden him somewhere and is keeping him in confinement, or he has killed him.",m
3225,"""I wish we could talk it over to-day, but, as you see, I'm helpless.",m
3226,"Remain in to-night, and I'll come as soon as I can get rid of these confounded people of mine.",m
3227,"""One word more!",m
3228,Be careful!,m
3229,"Miss B. is, up to this point, merely puzzled over things.",m
3230,"She doesn't suspect her uncle of any crookedness, I'm sure.",m
3231,So we shall have to tread softly where she is concerned.,m
3232,"""I shall see you to-night.--R.H.""",m
3233,Ste.,m
3234,"Marie read the closely written pages through twice, and he thought how like his friend it was to take the time and trouble to put what he had learnt into this clear concise form.",m
3235,"Another man would have scribbled: ""Important facts--tell you all about it to-night,"" or something of that kind.",m
3236,Hartley must have spent a quarter of an hour over his writing.,m
3237,Ste.,m
3238,"Marie walked up and down the room, with all his strength forcing his brain to quiet reasonable action.",m
3239,"Once he said aloud--  ""Yes, you're right, of course.",m
3240,"Stewart has been at the bottom of it all along.""",m
3241,"He realised that he had been for some days slowly arriving at that conclusion, and that, since the night before, he had been practically certain of it, though he had not yet found time to put his suspicions into logical order.",m
3242,"Hartley's letter had driven the truth concretely home to him, but he would have reached the same truth without it--though that matter of the will was of the greatest importance.",m
3243,It gave him a strong weapon to strike with.,m
3244,"He halted before one of the front windows, and his eyes gazed unseeing across the street into the green shrubbery of the Luxembourg Gardens.",m
3245,"The lace curtains had been left by the femme de menage hanging straight down and not, as usual, looped back at either side, but he could see through them with perfect ease although he could not be seen from outside.",m
3246,"He became aware that a man who was walking slowly up and down a path inside the high iron palings was in some way familiar to him, and his eyes sharpened.",m
3247,"The man was very inconspicuously dressed, and looked like almost any other man whom one might pass in the street without taking any notice of him; but Ste.",m
3248,"Marie knew that he had seen him often, and he wondered how and where.",m
3249,"There was a row of lilac shrubs against the iron palings just inside, and between the palings and the path, but two of the shrubs were dead and leafless, and each time the man passed this spot he came into plain view; each time also he directed an oblique glance towards the house opposite.",m
3250,"Presently he turned aside and sat down upon one of the public benches, where he was almost but not quite hidden by the intervening foliage.",m
3251,Then at last Ste.,m
3252,Marie gave a sudden exclamation and smote his hands together.,m
3253,"""The fellow's a spy!"" he cried aloud.",m
3254,"""He's watching the house to see when I go out.""",m
3255,"He began to remember how he had seen the man in the street and in cafes and restaurants, and he remembered that he had once or twice thought it odd but without any second thought of suspicion.",m
3256,"So the fellow had been set to spy upon him, watch his goings and comings and report them to--no need of asking to whom!",m
3257,Ste.,m
3258,Marie stood behind his curtains and looked across into the pleasant expanse of shrubbery and greensward.,m
3259,He was wondering if it would be worth while to do anything.,m
3260,"Men and women went up and down the path, hurrying or slowly, at ease with the world--labourers, students, bonnes with market baskets in their hands and long bread loaves under their arms, nursemaids herding small children, bigger children spinning diabolo spools as they walked.",m
3261,"A man with a pointed black beard and a soft hat passed once, and returned to seat himself upon the public bench that Ste.",m
3262,Marie was watching.,m
3263,"For some minutes he sat there idle, holding the soft felt hat upon his knees for coolness.",m
3264,"Then he turned and looked at the other occupant of the bench, and Ste.",m
3265,"Marie thought he saw the other man nod, though he could not be sure whether either one spoke or not.",m
3266,"Presently the newcomer rose, put on the soft hat again and disappeared down the path, going towards the gate at the head of the Rue de Luxembourg.",m
3267,Five minutes later the door-bell rang.                                                                Ste.,m
3268,Marie turned away from the window and crossed to the door.,m
3269,"The man with the pointed beard removed his soft hat, bowed very politely, and asked if he had the honour to address Monsieur Ste.",m
3270,Marie.,m
3271,"""That is my name,"" said Ste.",m
3272,Marie.,m
3273,"""Entrez, monsieur!""",m
3274,He waved his visitor to a chair and stood waiting.,m
3275,The man with the beard bowed once more.,m
3276,"He said--  ""I have not the great honour of monsieur's acquaintance, but circumstances, which I will explain later, have put it in my power--have made it a sacred duty, if I may be permitted to say the word--to place in monsieur's hands a piece of information.""",m
3277,Ste.,m
3278,Marie smiled slightly and sat down.,m
3279,"He said--  ""I listen with pleasure--and anticipation.",m
3280,"Pray go on!""",m
3281,"""I have information,"" said the visitor, ""of the whereabouts of M. Arthur Benham.""",m
3282,Ste.,m
3283,Marie waved his hand.,m
3284,"""I feared as much,"" said he.",m
3285,"""I mean to say, I hoped so.",m
3286,"Proceed, monsieur!""",m
3287,"""And learning,"" continued, the other, ""that M. Ste.",m
3288,"Marie was conducting a search for that young gentleman, I hastened at once to place this information in his hands.""",m
3289,"""At a price,"" suggested his host.",m
3290,"""At a price, to be sure.""",m
3291,The man with the beard spread out his hands in a beautiful and eloquent gesture which well accompanied his Marseillais accent.,m
3292,"""Ah, as to that!"" he protested.",m
3293,"""My circumstances--I am poor, Monsieur.",m
3294,One must gain the livelihood.,m
3295,What would you?,m
3296,A trifle.,m
3297,"The merest trifle.""",m
3298,"""Where is Arthur Benham?"" asked Ste.",m
3299,Marie.,m
3300,"""In Marseille, monsieur, I saw him a week ago--six days.",m
3301,"And so far as I could learn he had no intention of leaving there immediately--though it is, to be sure, hot.""",m
3302,St.,m
3303,"Marie laughed a laugh of genuine amusement, and the man with the pointed beard stared at him with some wonder.",m
3304,Ste.,m
3305,Marie rose and crossed the room to a writing-desk which stood against the opposite wall.,m
3306,"He fumbled in a drawer of this, and returned holding in his hand a pink and blue note of the Banque de France.",m
3307,"He said--  ""Monsieur----Pardon!",m
3308,I have forgotten to ask the name.,m
3309,You have remarked quite truly that one must gain a livelihood.,m
3310,Therefore I do not presume to criticise the way in which you gain yours.,m
3311,Sometimes one cannot choose.,m
3312,"However, I should like to make a little bargain with you, monsieur.",m
3313,"I know, of course, being not altogether imbecile, who sent you here with this story and why you were sent--why also your friend who sits upon the bench in the garden across the street follows me about and spies upon me.",m
3314,I know all this and I laugh at it a little.,m
3315,"But, monsieur, to amuse myself further I have a desire to hear from your own lips the name of the gentleman who is your employer.",m
3316,"Amusement is almost always expensive, and so I am prepared to pay for this.",m
3317,I have here a note of one hundred francs.,m
3318,It is yours in return for the name--the right name.,m
3319,"Remember, I know it already.""",m
3320,"The man with the pointed beard sprang to his feet, quivering with righteous indignation.",m
3321,"All southern Frenchmen like all other Latins, are magnificent actors.",m
3322,"He shook one clenched hand in the air, his face was pale and his fine eyes glittered.",m
3323,"Richard Hartley would have put himself promptly in an attitude of defence, but Ste.",m
3324,Marie nodded a smiling head in appreciation.,m
3325,He was half a southern Frenchman himself.,m
3326,"""Monsieur!"" cried his visitor in a choked voice.",m
3327,"""Monsieur, have a care!",m
3328,You insult me.,m
3329,"Have a care, monsieur!",m
3330,I am dangerous.,m
3331,"My anger when roused is terrible!""",m
3332,"""I am cowed!"" observed Ste.",m
3333,"Marie, lighting a cigarette.",m
3334,"""I quail.""",m
3335,"""Never,"" declaimed the gentleman from Marseille, ""have I received an insult without returning blow for blow.",m
3336,"My blood boils.""",m
3337,"""The hundred francs, monsieur,"" said Ste.",m
3338,"Marie, ""will doubtless cool it.",m
3339,"Besides, we stray from our sheep.",m
3340,"Reflect, my friend!",m
3341,I have not insulted you.,m
3342,I have asked you a simple question.,m
3343,"To be sure I have said that I knew your errand here was not--not altogether sincere; but I protest, monsieur, that no blame attaches to yourself.",m
3344,The blame is your employer's.,m
3345,You have performed your mission with the greatest of honesty--the most delicate and faithful sense of honour.,m
3346,"That is understood.""",m
3347,The gentleman with the beard strode across to one of the windows and leant his head upon his hand.,m
3348,"His shoulders still heaved with emotion, but he no longer trembled.",m
3349,The terrible crisis bade fair to pass.,m
3350,"Then abruptly, in the frank and open Latin way, he burst into tears, and wept with copious profusion, while Ste.",m
3351,Marie smoked his cigarette and waited.,m
3352,"When at length the Marseillais turned back into the room he was calm once more, but there remained traces of storm and flood.",m
3353,He made a gesture of indescribable and pathetic resignation.,m
3354,"""Monsieur,"" he exclaimed, ""you have a heart of gold.",m
3355,"Of gold, monsieur!",m
3356,You understand.,m
3357,Behold us! two men of honour.,m
3358,"""Monsieur,"" he said, ""I had no choice.",m
3359,I was poor.,m
3360,I saw myself face to face with the misere.,m
3361,What would you?,m
3362,I fell.,m
3363,We are all weak flesh.,m
3364,"I accepted the commission of the pig who sent me here to you.""",m
3365,Ste.,m
3366,"Marie smoothed the pink and blue banknote in his hands, and the other man's eye clung to it as though he were starving and the banknote food.",m
3367,"""The name?"" prompted Ste.",m
3368,Marie.,m
3369,The gentleman from Marseille tossed up his hands.,m
3370,"""Monsieur already knows it.",m
3371,Why should I hesitate?,m
3372,"The name is Ducrot.""",m
3373,"""What?"" cried Ste.",m
3374,Marie sharply.,m
3375,"""What is that?",m
3376,"Ducrot?""",m
3377,"""But naturally!"" said the other man with some wonder.",m
3378,"""Monsieur said he knew.",m
3379,"Certainly, Ducrot.",m
3380,"A little withered man, bald on the top of the head, creases down the cheeks, a moustache like this,""--he made a descriptive gesture--""a little chin.",m
3381,A man like an elderly cat.,m
3382,"M. Ducrot.""",m
3383,Ste.,m
3384,Marie gave a sigh of relief.,m
3385,"""Yes, yes,"" said he.",m
3386,"""Ducrot is as good a name as another.",m
3387,"The gentleman has more than one, it appears.",m
3388,"Monsieur, the hundred-franc note is yours.""",m
3389,"The gentleman from Marseille took it with a slightly trembling hand, and began to bow himself towards the door, as if he feared that his host would experience a change of heart, but Ste.",m
3390,"Marie checked him, saying--  ""One moment.",m
3391,"""I was thinking,"" said he, ""that you would perhaps not care to present yourself to your--employer, M. Ducrot, immediately: not for a few days, at least, in view of the fact that certain actions of mine will show him your mission has--well, miscarried.",m
3392,It would perhaps be well for you not to communicate with M. Ducrot.,m
3393,"He might be displeased with you.""",m
3394,"""Monsieur,"" said the gentleman with the beard, ""you speak with acumen and wisdom.",m
3395,"I shall neglect to report myself to M. Ducrot--who, I repeat, is a pig.""",m
3396,"""And,"" pursued Ste.",m
3397,"Marie, ""the individual on the bench across the street?""",m
3398,"""It is not necessary that I meet that individual either!"" said the Marseillais hastily.",m
3399,"""Monsieur, I bid you adieu!""",m
3400,"He bowed again, a profound, a scraping bow, and disappeared through the door.",m
3401,Ste.,m
3402,Marie crossed to the window and looked down upon the pavement below.,m
3403,He saw his visitor emerge from the house and slip rapidly down the street towards the Rue Vavin.,m
3404,"He glanced across into the Gardens, and the spy still sat there on his bench, but his head lay back and he slept--the sleep of the unjust.",m
3405,"One imagined that he must be snoring, for an incredibly small urchin in a blue apron stood on the path before him, and watched with the open mouth of astonishment.",m
3406,Ste.,m
3407,"Marie turned back into the room and began to tramp up and down, as was his way in a perplexity or in any time of serious thought.",m
3408,He wished very much that Richard Hartley were there to consult with.,m
3409,"He considered Hartley to have a judicial mind--a mind to establish, out of confusion, something like logical order, and he was very well aware that he himself had not that sort of mind at all.",m
3410,"In action he was sufficiently confident of himself, but to construct a course of action he was afraid, and he knew that a misstep now, at this critical point, might be fatal--turn success into disaster.",m
3411,"He fell to thinking of Captain Stewart (alias M. Ducrot), and he longed most passionately to leap into a fiacre at the corner below, to drive at a gallop across the city to the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
3412,"Honore, to fall upon that smiling hypocrite in his beautiful treasure-house, to seize him by the withered throat and say--  ""Tell me what you have done with Arthur Benham before I tear your head from your miserable body!""",m
3413,"Indeed, he was far from sure that this was not what it would come to, in the end; for he reflected that he had not only a tremendous accumulation of evidence with which to face Captain Stewart, but also a very terrible weapon to hold over his head--the threat of exposure to the old man who lay slowly dying in the Rue de l'Universite!",m
3414,"A few words in old David's ear, a few proofs of their truth, and the great fortune for which the son had sold his soul (if he had any left to sell) must pass for ever out of his reach, like gold seen in a dream.",m
3415,"This is what it might well come to, he said to himself.",m
3416,"Indeed, it seemed to him at that moment far the most feasible plan, for to such accusations, such demands as that, Captain Stewart could offer no defence.",m
3417,"To save himself from a more complete ruin he would have to give up the boy, or tell what he knew of him.",m
3418,But Ste.,m
3419,"Marie was unwilling to risk everything on this throw without seeing Richard Hartley first, and Hartley was not to be had until evening.",m
3420,"He told himself that, after all, there was no immediate hurry, for he was quite sure the man would be compelled to keep to his bed for a day or two.",m
3421,"He did not know much about epilepsy, but he knew that its paroxysms were followed by great exhaustion, and he felt sure that Stewart was far too weak in body to recuperate quickly from any severe call upon his strength.",m
3422,"He remembered how light that burden had been in his arms the night before, and then an uncontrollable shiver of disgust went over him as he remembered the sight of the horribly twisted and contorted face, felt again the shaking thumping head as it beat against his shoulder.",m
3423,"He wondered how much Stewart knew, how much he would be able to remember, of the events of the evening before, and he was at a loss there because of his unfamiliarity with epileptic seizures.",m
3424,"Of one thing, however, he was almost certain, and that was that the man could scarcely have been conscious of who were beside him when the fit was over.",m
3425,"If he had come at all to his proper senses, before the ensuing slumber of exhaustion, it must have been after Mlle.",m
3426,Nilssen and himself had gone away.,m
3427,"Upon that he fell to wondering about the spy and the gentleman from Marseille (he was a little sorry that Hartley could not have seen the gentleman from Marseille), but he reflected that the two were, without doubt, acting upon old orders, and that the latter had probably been stalking him for some days before he found him at home.",m
3428,He looked at his watch and it was half-past twelve.,m
3429,"There was nothing to be done, he considered, but wait--get through the day somehow; and so, presently, he went out to lunch.",m
3430,"He went up the Rue Vavin to the Boulevard Montparnasse, and down that broad thoroughfare to Lavenue's, on the busy Place de Rennes, where the cooking is the best in all this quarter, and can indeed hold up its head without shame in the face of those other more widely famous restaurants, across the river, frequented by the smart world and by the travelling gourmet.",m
3431,"He went through to the inner room, which is built like a raised loggia round two sides of a little garden, and which is always cool and fresh in summer.",m
3432,"He ordered a rather elaborate lunch and thought that he sat a very long time at it, but when he looked again at his watch only an hour and a half had gone by.",m
3433,It was a quarter-past two.,m
3434,Ste.,m
3435,Marie was depressed.,m
3436,"There remained almost all of the afternoon to be got through, and Heaven alone could say how much of the evening, before he could have his consultation with Richard Hartley.",m
3437,"He tried to think of some way of passing the time, but although he was not usually at a loss, he found his mind empty of ideas.",m
3438,None of his common occupations recommended themselves to him.,m
3439,He knew that whatever he tried to do he would interrupt it with pulling out his watch every half-hour or so and cursing the time because it lagged so slowly.,m
3440,"He went out to the terrasse for coffee, very low in his mind.",m
3441,"But half an hour later, as he sat behind his little marble-topped table, smoking and sipping a liqueur, his eyes fell upon something across the square which brought him to his feet with a sudden exclamation.",m
3442,One of the big electric trams that ply between the Place St.,m
3443,"Germain-des-Pres and Clamart, by way of the Porte de Versailles and Vanves, was dragging its unwieldy bulk round the turn from the Rue de Rennes into the boulevard.",m
3444,"He could see the sign-board along the imperiale: ""Clamart--St.",m
3445,"Germain-des-Pres"" with ""Issy"" and ""Vanves"" in brackets between.",m
3446,Ste.,m
3447,"Marie clinked a franc upon the table, and made off across the place at a run.",m
3448,"Omnibuses from Batignolles and Menilmontant got in his way, fiacres tried to run him down, and a motor-car in a hurry pulled up just in time to save his life, but Ste.",m
3449,"Marie ran on, and caught the tram before it had completed the negotiation of the long curve and gathered speed for its dash down the boulevard.",m
3450,"He sprang upon the step, and the conductor reluctantly unfastened the chain to admit him.",m
3451,"So he climbed up to the top and seated himself, panting.",m
3452,The dial high on the facade of the Gare Montparnasse said ten minutes to three.,m
3453,He had no definite plan of action.,m
3454,"He had started off in this headlong fashion upon the spur of a moment's impulse, and because he knew where the tram was going.",m
3455,"Now, embarked, he began to wonder if he was not a fool.",m
3456,"He knew every foot of the way to Clamart, for it was a favourite half-day's excursion with him to ride there in this fashion, walk thence through the beautiful Meudon wood across to the river, and, from Bellevue or Bas-Meudon, take a Suresnes boat back into the city.",m
3457,"He knew, or thought he knew, just where lay the house, surrounded by garden and half-wild park, of which Olga Nilssen had told him; he had often wondered whose it was as the tram rolled along the length of its high wall.",m
3458,"But he knew also that he could do nothing there, single-handed and without excuse or preparation.",m
3459,"He could not boldly ring the bell, demand speech with Mlle.",m
3460,"Coira O'Hara, and ask her if she knew any thing of the whereabouts of young Arthur Benham, whom a photographer had suspected of being in love with her.",m
3461,He certainly could not do that.,m
3462,And there seemed to be nothing else that----  Ste.,m
3463,Marie broke off this somewhat despondent course of reasoning with a sudden little voiceless cry.,m
3464,For the first time it occurred to him to connect the house on the Clamart road and Mlle.,m
3465,Coira O'Hara and young Arthur Benham.--  It will be remembered that the man had not yet had time to arrange his suddenly acquired mass of evidence in logical order and to make deductions from it.--For the first time he began to put two and two together.,m
3466,"Stewart had hidden away his nephew: this nephew was known to have been much enamoured of the girl Coira O'Hara: Coira O'Hara was said to be living (with her father? probably) in the house on the outskirts of Paris, where she was visited by Captain Stewart.",m
3467,Was not the inference plain enough--sufficiently reasonable?,m
3468,"It left, without doubt, many puzzling things to be explained?--perhaps too many; but Ste.",m
3469,"Marie sat forward in his seat, his eyes gleaming, his face tense with excitement.",m
3470,Was young Arthur Benham in the house on the Clamart road?,m
3471,"He said the words almost aloud, and he became aware that the fat woman with a live fowl at her feet, and the butcher's boy on his other side, were looking at him curiously.",m
3472,"He realised that he was behaving in an excited manner, and so sat back and lowered his eyes.",m
3473,"But over and over within him the words said themselves, over and over, until they made a sort of mad foolish refrain--  ""Is Arthur Benham in the house on the Clamart road?",m
3474,"Is Arthur Benham in the house on the Clamart road?""",m
3475,"He was afraid that he would say it aloud once more, and he tried to keep a firm hold upon himself.",m
3476,"The tram swung into the Rue de Sevres, and rolled smoothly out the long uninteresting stretch of the Rue Lecourbe, far out to where the houses became scattered, where mounds and pyramids of red tiles stood alongside the factory where they had been made, where an acre of little glass hemispheres in long straight rows winked and glistened in the afternoon sun--the forcing beds of some market gardener; out to the Porte de Versailles at the city wall, where a group of customs officers sprawled at ease before their little sentry-box, or loafed over to inspect ah incoming tram.",m
3477,"A bugle sounded and a drum beat from the great fosse under the wall, and a company of piou-pious, red capped, red trousered, shambled through their evolutions in a manner to break the heart of a British or a German drill-sergeant.",m
3478,"Then out past level fields to little Vanves, with its steep streets and its old grey church, and past the splendid grounds of the Lycee beyond.",m
3479,"The fat woman got down, her live fowl shrieking protest to the movement, and the butcher's boy got down too, so that Ste.",m
3480,"Marie was left alone upon the imperiale save for a snuffy old gentleman in a pot-hat, who sat in a corner buried behind the day's Droits de l'Homme.",m
3481,Ste.,m
3482,"Marie moved forward once more, and laid his arms upon the iron rail before him.",m
3483,They were coming near.,m
3484,"They ran past plum and apple orchards, and past humble little detached villas, each with a bit of garden in front and an acacia or two at the gate posts.",m
3485,"But presently, on the right, the way began to be bordered by a high stone wall, very long, behind which showed the trees of a park, and among them, far back from the wall, beyond a little rise of ground, the gables and chimneys of a house could be made out.",m
3486,"The wall went on for perhaps a quarter of a mile in a straight sweep, but halfway the road swung apart from it to the left, dipped under a stone rail way bridge, and so presently ended at the village of Clamart.",m
3487,"As the tram approached the beginning of that long stone wall it began to slacken speed, and there was a grating noise from underneath, and presently it came to an abrupt halt.",m
3488,Ste.,m
3489,"Marie looked over the guard-rail and saw that the driver had left his place and was kneeling in the dust beside the car, peering at its underworks.",m
3490,"The conductor strolled round to him after a moment and stood indifferently by, remarking upon the strange vicissitudes to which electrical propulsion was subject.",m
3491,"The driver, without looking up, called his colleague a number of the most surprising and, it is to be hoped, unwarranted names, and suddenly began to burrow under the tram, wriggling his way after the manner of the serpent, until nothing could be seen of him but two unrestful feet.",m
3492,His voice though muffled was still tolerably distinct.,m
3493,"It cursed in an unceasing staccato, and with admirable ingenuity, the tram, the conductor, the sacred dog of an impediment which had got itself wedged into one of the trucks, and the world in general.",m
3494,Ste.,m
3495,"Marie, sitting aloft, laughed for a moment, and then turned his eager eyes upon what lay across the road.",m
3496,The halt had taken place almost exactly at the beginning of that long stretch of the park wall which ran beside the road and the tramway.,m
3497,"From where he sat he could see the other wing, which led inward from the road at something like a right angle, but was presently lost to sight because of a sparse and unkempt patch of young trees and shrubs, well-nigh choked with undergrowth, which extended for some distance from the park wall backward along the roadside towards Vanves.",m
3498,"Whoever owned that stretch of land had seemingly not thought it worth while to cultivate it, or to build upon it, or even to clear it off.",m
3499,Ste.,m
3500,"Marie's first thought as his eye scanned the two long stretches of wall, and looked over their tops to the trees of the park and the far-off gables and chimneys of the house, was to wonder where the entrance to the place could be, and he decided that it must be on the side opposite to the Clamart tram-line.",m
3501,"He did not know the smaller roads hereabouts, but he guessed that there must be one somewhere beyond, between the Route de Clamart and the Fort d'Issy; and he was right.",m
3502,"There is a little road between the two: it sweeps round in a long curve, and ends near the tiny public garden in Issy, and it is called the rue Barbes.",m
3503,"His second thought was that this unkempt patch of trees and brush offered excellent cover for any one who might wish to pass an observant hour alongside that high stone wall--for any one who might desire to cast a glance over the lie of the land, to see at closer range that house of which so little could be seen from the Route de Clamart, to look over the wall's coping into park and garden.",m
3504,"The thought brought him to his feet with a leaping heart, and before he realised that he had moved he found himself in the road beside the halted tram.",m
3505,"The conductor brushed past him, mounting to his place, and from the platform he beckoned, crying out--  ""En voiture, monsieur!",m
3506,"En voiture!""",m
3507,Again something within Ste.,m
3508,"Marie that was not his conscious direction acted for him, and he shook his head.",m
3509,"The conductor gave two little blasts upon his horn, the tram wheezed and moved forward.",m
3510,"In a moment it was on its way, swinging along at full speed towards the curve in the line that bore to the left and dipped under the railway bridge.",m
3511,Ste.,m
3512,"Marie stood in the middle of that empty road, staring after it until it had disappeared from view.                                                                   Ste.",m
3513,"Marie had acted upon an impulse of which he was scarcely conscious at all, and when he found himself standing alone in the road and watching the Clamart tram disappear under the railway bridge, he called himself hard names and wondered what he was to do next.",m
3514,"He looked before and behind him, and there was no living soul in sight.",m
3515,"He bent his eyes again upon that unkempt patch of young trees and undergrowth, and once more the thought forced itself to his brain that it would make excellent cover for one who wished to observe a little--to reconnoitre.",m
3516,"He knew that it was the part of wisdom to turn his back upon this place, to walk on to Clamart or return to Vanves, and mount upon a homeward-bound tram.",m
3517,"He knew that it was the part of folly, of madness even, to expose himself to possible discovery by some one within the walled enclosure.",m
3518,"What though no one there were able to recognise him, still the sight of a man prowling about the walls, seeking to spy over them, might excite an alarm that would lead to all sorts of undesirable complications.",m
3519,Dimly Ste.,m
3520,"Marie realised all this, and he tried to turn his back and walk away, but the patch of little trees and shrubbery drew him with an irresistible fascination.",m
3521,"Just a little look along that unknown wall! he said to himself; just the briefest of all brief reconnaissances, the merest glance beyond the masking screen of wood growth, so that in case of sudden future need he might have the lie of the place clear in his mind; for without any sound reason for it he was somehow confident that this walled house and garden were to play an important part in the rescue of Arthur Benham.",m
3522,It was once more a matter of feeling.,m
3523,"The rather woman-like intuition which had warned him that O'Hara was concerned in young Benham's disappearance, and that the two were not far from Paris, was again at work in him, and he trusted it as he had done before.",m
3524,"He gave a little nod of determination, as one who, for good or ill, casts a die, and he crossed the road.",m
3525,"There was a deep ditch, and he had to climb down into it and up its farther side, for it was too broad to be jumped.",m
3526,So he came into the shelter of the young poplars and elms and oaks.,m
3527,"The underbrush caught at his clothes, and the dead leaves of past seasons crackled underfoot, but after a little space he came to somewhat clearer ground, though the saplings still stood thick about him and hid him securely.",m
3528,"He made his way inward along the wall, keeping a short distance back from it, and he saw that after twenty or thirty yards it turned again at a very obtuse angle away from him, and once more ran on in a long straight line.",m
3529,Just beyond this angle he came upon a little wooden door thickly studded with nails.,m
3530,"It was made to open inward, and on the outside there was no knob or handle of any kind, only a large keyhole of the simple old-fashioned sort.",m
3531,"Slipping up near to look, Ste.",m
3532,"Marie observed that the edges of the keyhole were rusty, but scratched a little through the rust with recent marks, so the door, it seemed, was sometimes used.",m
3533,He observed another thing.,m
3534,"The ground near by was less encumbered with trees than at any other point, and the turf was depressed with many wheel marks--broad marks such as are made only by the wheels of a motor-car.",m
3535,"He followed these tracks for a little distance and they wound in and out among the trees and, beyond the thin fringe of wood, swept away in a curve towards Issy, doubtless to join the road which he had already imagined to lie somewhere beyond the enclosure.",m
3536,"Beyond the more open space about this little door the young trees stood thick together again, and Ste.",m
3537,Marie pressed cautiously on.,m
3538,"He stopped now and then to listen, and once he thought that he heard from within the sound of a woman's laugh, but he could not be sure.",m
3539,"The slight change of direction had confused him a little, and he was uncertain as to where the house lay.",m
3540,"The wall was twelve or fifteen feet high, and from the level of the ground he could of course see nothing over it but tree-tops.",m
3541,"He went on for what may have been a hundred yards, but it seemed to him very much more than that, and he came to a tall gnarled cedar-tree which stood almost against the high wall.",m
3542,"It was half dead but its twisted limbs were thick and strong, and by force of the tree's cramped position they had grown in strange and grotesque forms.",m
3543,"One of them stretched across the very top of the stone wall, and, with the wind's action, it had scraped away the coping of tiles and bottle-glass, and had made a little depression there to rest in.",m
3544,Ste.,m
3545,"Marie looked up along this natural ladder, and temptation smote him sorely.",m
3546,It was so easy and so safe!,m
3547,"There was enough foliage left upon the half-dead tree to screen him well, but whether or no it is probable that he would have yielded to the proffered lure.",m
3548,There seems to have been more than chance in Ste.,m
3549,Marie's movements upon this day.,m
3550,"There seems to have been something like the hand of Fate in them, as doubtless there is in most things, if one but knew.",m
3551,"He left his hat and stick behind him under a shrub, and he began to make his way up the half-bare branches of the gnarled cedar.",m
3552,"They bore him well, without crack or rustle, and the way was very easy.",m
3553,No ladder made by man could have offered a much simpler ascent.,m
3554,"So mounting slowly and with care, his head came level with the top of the wall.",m
3555,"He climbed to the next branch, a foot higher, and rested there.",m
3556,"The drooping foliage from the upper part of the cedar-tree, which was still alive, hung down over him and cloaked him from view, but through its aromatic screen he could see as freely as through the window curtain in the Rue d'Assas.",m
3557,"The house lay before him, a little to the left, and perhaps a hundred yards away.",m
3558,"It was a disappointing house to find in that great enclosure, for though it was certainly neither small nor trivial, it was as certainly far from possessing anything like grandeur.",m
3559,"It had been in its day a respectable unpretentious square structure of three stories, entirely without architectural beauty, but also entirely without the ornate hideousness of the modern villas along the Route de Clamart.",m
3560,"Now, however, the stucco was gone in great patches from its stone walls, giving them an unpleasantly diseased look, and long neglect of all decent care had lent the place the air almost of desertion.",m
3561,"Anciently the grounds before the house had been laid out in the formal fashion, with a terrace and geometrical lawns, and a pool and a fountain, and a rather fine long vista between clipped larches; but the same neglect which had made shabby the stuccoed house had allowed grass and weeds to grow over the gravel paths, underbrush to spring up and to encroach upon the geometrical turf plots, the long double row of clipped larches to flourish at will or to die, or to fall prostrate and lie where they had fallen.",m
3562,"So all the broad enclosure was a scene of heedless neglect, a riot of unrestrained and wanton growth, where should have been decorous and orderly beauty.",m
3563,"It was a sight to bring tears to a gardener's eyes, but it had a certain untamed charm of its own, for all that.",m
3564,"The very riot of it, the wanton prodigality of untouched natural growth, produced an effect that was by no means all disagreeable.",m
3565,An odd and whimsical thought came into Ste.,m
3566,"Marie's mind, that thus must have looked the garden and park round the castle of the Sleeping Beauty when the Prince came to wake her.",m
3567,But sleeping beauties and unkempt grounds went from him in a flash when he became aware of a sound which was like the sound of voices.,m
3568,Instinctively he drew farther back into the shelter of his aromatic screen.,m
3569,"His eyes swept the space below him, from right to left, and could see no one.",m
3570,"So he sat very still, save for the thunderous beat of a heart which seemed to him like drum beats when soldiers are marching, and he listened--""all ears"" as the phrase goes.",m
3571,The sound was in truth a sound of voices.,m
3572,"He was presently assured of that, but for some time he could not make out from which direction it came.",m
3573,"And so he was the more startled when quite suddenly there appeared from behind a row of tall shrubs two young people, moving slowly together up the untrimmed turf in the direction of the house.",m
3574,The two young people were Mlle.,m
3575,"Coira O'Hara and Arthur Benham, and upon the brow of this latter youth there was no sign of dungeon pallor, upon his free moving limbs no ball and chain.",m
3576,There was no apparent reason why he should not hasten back to the eager arms in the Rue de l'Universite if he chose to--unless indeed his undissembling attitude towards Mlle.,m
3577,Coira O'Hara might serve as a reason.,m
3578,"The young man followed at her heel with much the manner and somewhat the appearance of a small dog, humbly conscious of unworthiness, but hopeful nevertheless of an occasional kind word or pat on the head.",m
3579,The world wheeled multi-coloured and kaleidoscopic before Ste.,m
3580,"Marie's eyes, and in his ears there was a rushing of great winds, but he set his teeth and clung with all the strength he had to the tree which sheltered him.",m
3581,"His first feeling, after that initial giddiness, was anger, sheer anger, a bewildered and astonished fury.",m
3582,"He had thought to find this poor youth in captivity, pining through prison bars for the home and the loved ones and the familiar life from which he had been ruthlessly torn.",m
3583,"Yet here he was strolling in a suburban garden with a lady--free, free as air (or so he seemed).",m
3584,Ste.,m
3585,"Marie thought of the grim and sorrowful old man in Paris who was sinking untimely into his grave because his grandson did not return to him: he thought of that timid soul--more shadow than woman--the boy's mother: he thought of Helen Benham's tragic eyes, and he could have beaten young Arthur half to death, in that moment, in the righteous rage that stormed within him.",m
3586,"But he turned his eyes from this wretched youth to the girl who walked beside, a little in advance, and the rage died in him swiftly.",m
3587,"After all was she not one to make any boy--or any man--forget duty, home, friends, everything!",m
3588,"Rather oddly his mind flashed back to the morning, and to the words of the little photographer, Bernstein.",m
3589,"Perhaps the Jew had put it as well as any man man could--  ""She was a goddess, that lady, a queen of goddesses ... the young Juno before marriage....""",m
3590,Ste.,m
3591,Marie nodded his head.,m
3592,"Yes, she was just that.",m
3593,The little Jew had spoken well.,m
3594,"It could not be more fairly put, though without doubt it could have been expressed at much greater length and with a great deal more eloquence.",m
3595,"The photographer's other words came also to his mind, the more detailed description; and again he nodded his head, for this too was true.",m
3596,"""She was all colour--brown skin with a dull red stain under the cheeks, and a great mass of hair that was not black but very nearly black--except in the sun, and then there were red lights in it.""",m
3597,It occurred to Ste.,m
3598,"Marie, whimsically, that the two young people might have stepped out of the door of Bernstein's studio straight into this garden, judging from their bearing, each to the other.",m
3599,"""Ah, a thing to touch the heart!",m
3600,Such devotion as that!,m
3601,"Alas, that the lady should seem so cold to it! ...",m
3602,"Still, a goddess.",m
3603,What would you?,m
3604,A queen among goddesses....,m
3605,One would not have them laugh and make little jokes....,m
3606,Make eyes at love-sick boys.,m
3607,"No indeed!""",m
3608,Certainly Mlle.,m
3609,Coira O'Hara was not making eyes at the love-sick boy who followed at her heels this afternoon.,m
3610,"Perhaps it would be going too far to say that she was cold to him, but it was very plain to see that she was bored and weary, and that she wished she might be almost anywhere else than where she was, She turned her beautiful face a little towards the wall where Ste Marie lay perdu, and he could see that her eyes had the same dark fire, the same tragic look of appeal, that he had seen in them before--once in the Champs Elysees and again in his dreams.",m
3611,"Abruptly he became aware that while he gazed, like a man in a trance, the two young people walked on their way and were on the point of passing beyond reach of eye or ear.",m
3612,"He made a sudden involuntary movement as if he would call them back, and, for the first time, his faithful hiding-place, strained beyond silent endurance, betrayed him with a loud rustle of shaken branches.",m
3613,Ste.,m
3614,"Marie shrank back, his heart in his throat.",m
3615,It was too late to retreat now down the tree.,m
3616,The damage was already done.,m
3617,"He saw the two young people halt and turn to look, and, after a moment, he saw the boy slowly come forward, staring.",m
3618,"He heard him say--  ""What's up in that tree?",m
3619,"There's something in the tree.""",m
3620,"And he heard the girl answer: ""It's only birds fighting.",m
3621,"Don't bother!""",m
3622,"But young Arthur Benham came on, staring up curiously until he was almost under the high wall.",m
3623,Then Ste.,m
3624,"Marie's strange madness, or the hand of Fate, or whatever power it was which governed him on that day, thrust him on to the ultimate pitch of recklessness.",m
3625,"He bent forward from his insecure perch over the wall until his head and shoulders were in plain sight, and he called down to the lad below in a loud whisper--  ""Benham!",m
3626,"Benham!""",m
3627,The boy gave a sharp cry of alarm and began to back away.,m
3628,And after a moment Ste.,m
3629,Marie heard the cry echoed from Coira O'Hara.,m
3630,"He heard her say--  ""Be careful!",m
3631,"Be careful, Arthur!",m
3632,Come away.,m
3633,"Oh, come away quickly!""",m
3634,Ste.,m
3635,Marie raised his own voice to a sort of cry.,m
3636,"He said--  ""Wait!",m
3637,"I tell you to wait, Benham!",m
3638,I must have a word with you.,m
3639,"I come from your family--from Helen!""",m
3640,"To his amazement the lad turned about and began to run towards where the girl stood waiting; and so, without a moment's hesitation Ste.",m
3641,"Marie threw himself across the top of the wall, hung for an instant by his hands, and dropped upon the soft turf.",m
3642,"Scarcely waiting to recover his balance he stumbled forward, shouting--  ""Wait!",m
3643,"I tell you, wait!",m
3644,Are you mad?,m
3645,"Wait, I say!",m
3646,"Listen to me!""",m
3647,"Vaguely, in the midst of his great excitement, he had heard a whistle sound as he dropped inside the wall.",m
3648,"He did not know then from whence the shrill call had come, but afterwards he knew that Coira had blown it.",m
3649,"And now, as he ran forward towards the two who stood at a distance staring at him, he heard other steps and he slackened his pace to look.",m
3650,"A man came running down amongst the black-boled trees, a strange, squat, gnome-like man, whose gait was as uncouth as his dwarfish figure.",m
3651,"He held something in his two hands as he ran, and when he came near he threw this thing with a swift movement up before him, but he did not pause in his odd scrambling run.",m
3652,Ste.,m
3653,Marie felt a violent blow upon his left leg between hip and knee.,m
3654,"He thought that somebody had crept up behind him and struck him, but, as he whirled about, he saw that there was no one there, and then he heard a noise, and knew that the gnome-like running man had shot him.",m
3655,He faced about once more towards the two young people.,m
3656,"He was very angry, and he wished to say so, and very much he wished to explain why he had trespassed there, and why they had no right to shoot him as if he were some wretched thief.",m
3657,But he found that in some quite absurd fashion he was as if fixed to the ground.,m
3658,"It was as if he had suddenly become of the most ponderous and incredible weight like lead--or like that other metal, not gold, which is the heaviest of all.",m
3659,"Only the metal, seemingly, was not only heavy but fiery hot, and his strength was incapable of holding it up any longer.",m
3660,His eyes fixed themselves in a bewildered stare upon the figure of Mlle.,m
3661,"Coira O'Hara, he had time to observe that she had put up her two hands over her face, then he fell down forward, his head struck upon something very hard, and he knew no more.                                                             Captain Stewart walked nervously up and down the small inner drawing-room at La Lierre, his restless hands fumbling together behind him, and his eyes turning every half-minute with a sharp eagerness to the closed door.",m
3662,"But at last, as if he were very tired, he threw himself down in a chair which stood near one of the windows, and all his tense body seemed to relax in utter exhaustion.",m
3663,"It was not a very comfortable chair that he had sat down in, but there were no comfortable chairs in the room--nor for that matter in all the house.",m
3664,"When he had taken the place--about two months before this time--he had taken it furnished, but that does not mean very much in France.",m
3665,"No French country houses--or town houses either--are in the least comfortable, by Anglo-Saxon standards, and that is at least one excellent reason why Frenchmen spend just as little time in them as they possibly can.",m
3666,Half the cafes in Paris would promptly put up their shutters if Parisian homes could all at once turn themselves into something like English or American ones.,m
3667,"As for La Lierre it was even more dreary and bare and tomb-like than other country houses, because it was after all a sort of ruin, and had not been lived in for fifteen years, save by an ancient caretaker and his nearly as ancient wife.",m
3668,"And that was perhaps why it could be taken, on a short lease, at a very low price.",m
3669,"The room in which Captain Stewart sat was behind the large drawing-room, which was always kept closed now, and it looked out by one window to the west, and by two windows to the north, over a corner of the kitchen-garden, and a vista of trees beyond.",m
3670,"It was a high-ceiled room with walls bare, except for two large mirrors in the Empire fashion, which stared at each other across the way with dull and flaking eyes.",m
3671,"Under each of these stood a heavy gilt and ebony console with a top of chocolate-coloured marble, and in the centre of the room there was a table of a like fashion to the consoles.",m
3672,"Further than this there was nothing save three chairs, upon one of which lay Captain Stewart's dust-coat and motoring cap and goggles.",m
3673,"A shaft of golden light from the low sun slanted into the place through the western window, from which the Venetians had been pulled back, and fell across the face of the man, who lay still and lax in his chair, eyes closed and chin dropped a little so that his mouth hung weakly open.",m
3674,"He looked very ill, as indeed any one might look after such an attack as he had suffered on the night previous.",m
3675,That one long moment of deathly fear before he had fallen down in a fit had nearly killed him.,m
3676,All through this following day it had continued to recur until he thought he should go mad.,m
3677,And there was worse still.,m
3678,How much did Olga Nilssen know?,m
3679,And how much had she told?,m
3680,"She had astonished and frightened him when she had said that she knew about the house on the road to Clamart, for he thought he had hidden his visits to La Lierre well.",m
3681,"He wondered rather drearily how she had discovered them, and he wondered how much she knew more than she had admitted.",m
3682,"He had a half-suspicion of something like the truth, that Mlle.",m
3683,"Nilssen knew only of Coira O'Hara's presence here, and drew a rather natural inference.",m
3684,"If that was all, there was no danger from her--no more, that is, than had already borne its fruit; for Stewart knew well enough that Ste.",m
3685,Marie must have learned of the place from her.,m
3686,In any case Olga Nilssen had left Paris--he had discovered that fact during the day--and so for the present she might be eliminated as a source of peril.,m
3687,"The man in the chair gave a little groan, and rolled his head wearily to and fro against the uncomfortable chair-back; for now he came to the real and immediate danger, and he was so very tired and ill, and his head ached so sickeningly, that it was almost beyond him to bring himself face to face with it.",m
3688,There was the man who lay helpless upon a bed upstairs!,m
3689,"And there were the man's friends, who were not at all helpless or bedridden or in captivity!",m
3690,"A wave of almost intolerable pain swept through Stewart's aching head, and he gave another groan which was almost like a child's sob.",m
3691,"But at just that moment the door which led into the central hall opened, and the Irishman O'Hara came into the room.",m
3692,"Captain Stewart sprang to his feet to meet him, and he caught the other man by the arm in his eagerness.",m
3693,"""How is he?"" he cried out.",m
3694,"""How is he?",m
3695,"How badly was he hurt?""",m
3696,"""The patient?"" said O'Hara.--""Let go my arm!",m
3697,"Hang it, man, you're pinching me!--Oh, he'll do well enough.",m
3698,He'll be fit to hobble about in a week or ten days.,m
3699,The bullet went clean through his leg and out again without cutting an artery.,m
3700,It was a sort of miracle.,m
3701,"And a damned lucky miracle for all hands, too!",m
3702,If we'd had a splintered bone or a severed artery to deal with I should have had to call in a doctor.,m
3703,"Then the fellow would have talked, and there'd have been the devil to pay.",m
3704,As it is I shall be able to manage well enough with my own small skill.,m
3705,I've dressed worse wounds than that in my time.,m
3706,"By Jove, it was a miracle though!""",m
3707,A sudden little gust of rage swept him.,m
3708,"He cried out:  ""That confounded fool of a gardener, that one-eyed Michel, ought to be beaten to death.",m
3709,"Why couldn't he have slipped up behind this fellow and knocked him on the head, instead of shooting him from ten paces away?",m
3710,The benighted idiot!,m
3711,"He came near upsetting the whole boat!""",m
3712,"""Yes,"" said Captain Stewart with a sharp hard breath, ""he should have shot straighter or not at all.""",m
3713,"The Irishman stared at him with his bright blue eyes, and after a moment he gave a short laugh.",m
3714,"""Jove, you're a bloodthirsty beggar, Stewart!"" said he.",m
3715,"""That would have been a rum go, if you like!",m
3716,Killing the fellow!,m
3717,"All his friends down on us like hawks, and the police and all that!",m
3718,"You can't go about killing people in the outskirts of Paris, you know--at least not people with friends.",m
3719,"And this chap looks like a gentleman, more or less, so I take it he has friends.",m
3720,As a matter of fact his face is rather familiar.,m
3721,I think I've seen him before somewhere.,m
3722,You looked at him just now through the crack of the door; do you know who he is?,m
3723,"Coira tells me he called out to Arthur by name, but Arthur says he never saw him before, and doesn't know him at all.""",m
3724,Captain Stewart shivered.,m
3725,"It had not been a pleasant moment for him, that moment when he had looked through the crack of the door and recognised Ste.",m
3726,Marie.,m
3727,"""Yes,"" he said half under his breath.",m
3728,"""Yes, I know who he is.",m
3729,"A friend of the family.""",m
3730,The Irishman's lips puckered to a low whistle.,m
3731,"He said--  ""Spying then, as I thought.",m
3732,"He has run us to earth.""",m
3733,And the other nodded.,m
3734,O'Hara took a turn across the room and back.,m
3735,"""In that case,"" he said presently, ""in that case then we must keep him prisoner here so long as we remain.",m
3736,"That's certain.""",m
3737,"He spun round sharply, with an exclamation.",m
3738,"""Look here!"" he cried in a lower tone, ""how about this fellow's friends?",m
3739,It isn't likely he's doing his dirty work alone.,m
3740,How about his friends when he doesn't turn up to-night?,m
3741,"If they know he was coming here to spy on us, if they know where the place is, if they know--in short, what he seems to have known, we're done for.",m
3742,"We'll have to run, get out, disappear.",m
3743,"Hang it, man, d'you understand?",m
3744,"We're not safe here for an hour.""",m
3745,"Captain Stewart's hands shook a little as he gripped them together behind him, and a dew of perspiration stood out suddenly upon his forehead and cheek bones, but his voice when he spoke was well under control.",m
3746,"""It's an odd thing,"" said he, ""another miracle, if you like; but I believe we are safe--reasonably safe.",m
3747,"I--have reason to think that this fellow learnt about La Lierre only last evening, from some one who left Paris to-day to be gone a long time.",m
3748,And I also have reason to believe that the fellow has not seen the one friend who is in his confidence since he obtained his information.,m
3749,"By chance I met the friend, the other man, in the street this afternoon.",m
3750,"I asked after this fellow whom we have here, and the friend said he hadn't seen him for twenty-four hours, was going to see him to-night.""",m
3751,"""By the Lord!"" cried the Irishman with a great laugh of relief.",m
3752,"""What luck!",m
3753,What monumental luck!,m
3754,"If all that's true, we're safe.",m
3755,"Why, man, we're as safe as a fox in his hole.",m
3756,The lad's friends won't have the ghost of an idea of where he's gone to....,m
3757,"""Wait though!",m
3758,Stop a bit!,m
3759,"He won't have left written word behind him, eh?",m
3760,"He won't have done that--for safety?""",m
3761,"""I think not,"" said Captain Stewart; but he breathed hard, for he knew well enough that there lay the gravest danger.",m
3762,"""I think not,"" he said again.",m
3763,He made a rather surprisingly accurate guess at the truth--that Ste.,m
3764,"Marie had started out upon impulse, without intending more than a general reconnaissance, and therefore without leaving any word behind him.",m
3765,"Still, the shadow of danger uplifted itself before the man and he was afraid.",m
3766,A sudden gust of weak anger shook him like a wind.,m
3767,"""In Heaven's name,"" he cried shrilly, ""why didn't that one-eyed fool kill the fellow while he was about it?",m
3768,There's danger for us every moment while he is alive here.,m
3769,"Why didn't that shambling idiot kill him?""",m
3770,"Captain Stewart's outflung hand jumped and trembled, and his face was twisted into a sort of grinning snarl.",m
3771,"He looked like an angry and wicked cat, the other man thought.",m
3772,"""If I weren't an over-civilised fool,"" he said viciously, ""I'd go upstairs and kill him now with my hands--while he can't help himself.",m
3773,"We're all too scrupulous by half.""",m
3774,The Irishman stared at him and presently broke into amazed laughter.,m
3775,"""Scrupulous!"" said he.",m
3776,"""Well, yes, I'm too scrupulous to murder a man in his bed, if you like.",m
3777,"I'm not squeamish, but----Good Lord!""",m
3778,"""Do you realise,"" demanded Captain Stewart, ""what risks we run while that fellow is alive--knowing what he knows?""",m
3779,"""Oh yes, I realise that,"" said O'Hara.",m
3780,"""But I don't see why you should have heart failure over it.""",m
3781,Captain Stewart's pale lips drew back again in their cat-like fashion.,m
3782,"""Never mind about me,"" he said.",m
3783,"""But I can't help thinking you're peculiarly indifferent in the face of danger.""",m
3784,"""No, I'm not!"" said the Irishman quickly.",m
3785,"""No, I'm not.",m
3786,"Don't you run away with that idea!""",m
3787,For the first time his hard face began to show feeling.,m
3788,"He turned away with a quick nervous movement, and stood staring out of the window into the late sunlight.",m
3789,"""I merely said,"" he went on, ""I merely said that I'd stop short of murder.",m
3790,I don't set any foolish value on life--my own or any other.,m
3791,"I've had to take life more than once, but it was in fair fight or in self-defence, and I don't regret it.",m
3792,It was your cold-blooded joke about going upstairs and killing this chap in his bed that put me on edge.,m
3793,"Naturally, I know you didn't mean it.""",m
3794,He swung back towards the other man.,m
3795,"""So don't you worry about me!"" said he after a little pause.",m
3796,"""Don't you go thinking that I'm lukewarm or that I'm indifferent to danger.",m
3797,"I know there's danger from this lad upstairs, and I mean to be on guard against it.",m
3798,He stays here under strict guard until--what we're after is accomplished--until young Arthur comes of age.,m
3799,"""If there's danger,"" said he, ""why we know where it lies and we can guard against it.",m
3800,That kind of danger is not very formidable.,m
3801,"The dangerous dangers are the ones that you don't know about--the hidden ones.""",m
3802,"He came forward a little, and his lean face was as hard and as impassive as ever, and the bright blue eyes shone from it steady and unwinking.",m
3803,Stewart looked up to him with a sort of peevish resentment at the man's confidence and cool poise.,m
3804,It was an odd reversal of their ordinary relations.,m
3805,"For the hour the duller villain, the man who was wont to take orders and to refrain from overmuch thought or question, seemed to have become master.",m
3806,Sheer physical exhaustion and the constant maddening pain had had their will of Captain Stewart.,m
3807,A sudden shiver wrung him so that his dry fingers rattled against the wood of the chair arms.,m
3808,"""All the same,"" he cried, ""I'm afraid.",m
3809,I've been confident enough until now.,m
3810,Now I'm afraid.,m
3811,"I wish the fellow had been killed.""",m
3812,"""Kill him then!"" laughed the Irishman.",m
3813,"""I won't give you up to the police.""",m
3814,"He crossed the room to the door, but halted short of it and turned about again, and he looked back very curiously at the man who sat crouched in his chair by the window.",m
3815,It had occurred to him several times that Stewart was very unlike himself.,m
3816,"The man was quite evidently tired and ill, and that might account for some of the nervousness; but this fierce malignity was something a little beyond O'Hara's comprehension.",m
3817,It seemed to him that the elder man had the air of one frightened beyond the point the circumstances warranted.,m
3818,"""Are you going back to town?"" he asked, ""or do you mean to stay the night?""",m
3819,"""I shall stay the night,"" Stewart said.",m
3820,"""I'm too tired to bear the ride.""",m
3821,He glanced up and caught the other's eyes fixed upon him.,m
3822,"""Well,"" he cried angrily.",m
3823,"""What is it?",m
3824,What are you looking at me like that for?,m
3825,"What do you want?""",m
3826,"""I want nothing,"" said the Irishman a little sharply.",m
3827,"""And I wasn't aware that I'd been looking at you in any unusual way.",m
3828,"You're precious jumpy, to-day, if you want to know...",m
3829,"Look here!""",m
3830,"He came back a step, frowning.",m
3831,"""Look here,"" he repeated.",m
3832,"""I don't quite make you out.",m
3833,Are you keeping back anything?,m
3834,Because if you are for Heaven's sake have it out here and now!,m
3835,"We're all in this game together, and we can't afford to be anything but frank with each other.",m
3836,We can't afford to make reservations.,m
3837,It's altogether too dangerous for everybody.,m
3838,You're too much frightened.,m
3839,"There's no apparent reason for being so frightened as that.""",m
3840,"Captain Stewart drew a long breath between closed teeth, and afterwards he looked up at the younger man coldly.",m
3841,"""We need not discuss my personal feelings, I think,"" said he.",m
3842,"""They have no--no bearing on the point at issue.",m
3843,"As you say, we are all in this thing together and you need not fear that I shall fail to do my part, as I have done it in the past...",m
3844,"That's all, I believe.""",m
3845,"""Oh, as you like!",m
3846,"As you like!"" said the Irishman in the tone of one rebuffed.",m
3847,"He turned again and left the room, closing the door behind him.",m
3848,Outside on the stairs it occurred to him that he had forgotten to ask the other man what this fellow's name was--the fellow who lay wounded upstairs.,m
3849,"No, he had asked once, but, in the interest of the conversation, the question had been lost.",m
3850,He determined to inquire again that evening at dinner.,m
3851,"But Captain Stewart, left thus alone, sank deeper in the uncomfortable chair, and his head once more stirred and sought vainly for ease against the chair's high back.",m
3852,The pain swept him in regular throbbing waves that were like the waves of the sea--waves which surge and crash and tear upon a beach.,m
3853,But between the throbs of physical pain there was something else that was always present while the waves came and went.,m
3854,"Pain and exhaustion, if they are sufficiently extreme, can wellnigh paralyse mind as well as body, and for some time Captain Stewart wondered what this thing might be which lurked at the bottom of him, still under the surges of agony.",m
3855,"Then at last he had the strength to look at it, and it was fear, cold and still and silent.",m
3856,He was afraid to the very depths of his soul.,m
3857,"True, as O'Hara had said, there did not seem to be any very desperate peril to face; but Stewart was afraid with the gambler's unreasoning, half-superstitious fear, and that is the worst fear of all.",m
3858,He realised that he had been afraid of Ste.,m
3859,"Marie from the beginning, and that, of course, was why he had tried to draw him into partnership with himself in his own official and wholly mythical search for Arthur Benham.",m
3860,He could have had the other man under his eye then.,m
3861,He could have kept him busy for months running down false scents.,m
3862,"As it was, Ste.",m
3863,Marie's uncanny instinct about the Irishman O'Hara had led him true--that and what he doubtless learned from Olga Nilssen.,m
3864,"If Stewart had been in a condition and mood to philosophise, he would doubtless have reflected that seven-tenths of the desperate causes, both good and bad, which fail in this world, fail because they are wrecked by some woman's love or jealousy (or both).",m
3865,"But it is unlikely that he was able just at this time to make such a reflection, though certainly he wondered how much Olga Nilssen had known, and how much Ste.",m
3866,Marie had had to put together out of her knowledge and any previous suspicions which he may have had.,m
3867,The man would have been amazed if he could have known what a mountain of information and evidence had piled itself up over his head all in twelve hours.,m
3868,"He would have been amazed and, if possible, even more frightened than he was; but he was without question sufficiently frightened, for here was Ste.",m
3869,"Marie in the very house, he had seen Arthur Benham, and quite obviously he knew all there was to know, or at least enough to ruin Arthur Benham's uncle beyond all recovery or hope of recovery--irretrievably.",m
3870,"Captain Stewart tried to think what it would mean to him--failure in this desperate scheme, but he had not the strength or the courage.",m
3871,He shrank from the picture as one shrinks from something horrible in a bad dream.,m
3872,There could be no question of failure.,m
3873,"He had to succeed at any cost, however desperate or fantastic.",m
3874,Once more the spasm of childish futile rage swept over him and shook him like a wind.,m
3875,"""Why couldn't the fellow have been killed by that one-eyed fool!"" he cried, sobbing.",m
3876,"""Why couldn't he have been killed?",m
3877,He's the only one who knows--the only thing in the way.,m
3878,"Why couldn't he have been killed?""",m
3879,"Quite suddenly Captain Stewart ceased to sob and shiver, and sat still in his chair, gripping the arms with white and tense fingers.",m
3880,His eyes began to widen and they became fixed in a long strange stare.,m
3881,He drew a deep breath.,m
3882,"""I wonder!"" he said aloud.",m
3883,"""I wonder, now.""                                                                   That providential stone or tree-root, or whatever it may have been, proved a genuine blessing in disguise to Ste.",m
3884,Marie.,m
3885,"It gave him a splitting headache for a few hours, but it saved him a good deal of discomfort the while his bullet wound was being more or less probed, and very skilfully cleansed and dressed by O'Hara.",m
3886,"For he did not regain consciousness until this surgical work was almost at its end, and then he wanted to fight the Irishman for tying the bandages too tight.",m
3887,"But when O'Hara had gone away and left him alone he lay still--or as still as the smarting burning pain in his leg and the ache in his head would let him--and stared at the wall beyond his bed, and, bit by bit, the events of the past hour came back to him and he knew where he was.",m
3888,"He cursed himself very bitterly, as he well might do, for a bungling idiot.",m
3889,"The whole thing had been in his hands, he said with perfect truth--Arthur Benham's whereabouts proved, Stewart's responsibility, or at the very least complicity, and the sordid motive therefor.",m
3890,"Remained, had Ste.",m
3891,"Marie been a sane being instead of an impulsive fool, remained but to face Stewart down in the presence of witnesses, threaten him with exposure, and so, with perfect ease, bring back the lost boy in triumph to his family.",m
3892,"It should all have been so simple, so easy, so effortless!",m
3893,"Yet now it was ruined by a moment's rash folly, and Heaven alone knew what would come of it.",m
3894,He remembered that he had left behind him no indication whatever of where he meant to spend the afternoon.,m
3895,Hartley would come hurrying across town that evening to the Rue d'Assas and would find no one there to receive him.,m
3896,He would wait and wait and at last go home.,m
3897,"He would come again on the next morning, and then he would begin to be alarmed and would start a second search--but with what to reckon by?",m
3898,Nobody knew about the house on the road to Clamart but Mlle.,m
3899,"Olga Nilssen, and she was far away.",m
3900,"He thought of Captain Stewart, and he wondered if that gentleman was by any chance here in the house, or if he was still in bed in the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
3901,"Honore, recovering from his epileptic fit.",m
3902,"After that he fell once more to cursing himself and his incredible stupidity, and he could have wept for sheer bitterness of chagrin.",m
3903,"He was still engaged in this unpleasant occupation when the door of the room opened and the Irishman O'Hara entered, having finished his interview with Captain Stewart below.",m
3904,"He came up beside the bed and looked down not unkindly upon the man who lay there, but Ste.",m
3905,"Marie scowled back at him, for he was in a good deal of pain and a vile humour.",m
3906,"""How's the leg--and the head?"" asked the amateur surgeon--to do him justice he was very skilful indeed through much experience.",m
3907,"""They hurt,"" said Ste.",m
3908,Marie shortly.,m
3909,"""My head aches like the devil, and my leg burns.""",m
3910,"O'Hara made a sound which was rather like a gruff laugh, and nodded.",m
3911,"""Yes, and they'll go on doing it too,"" said he.",m
3912,"""At least the leg will.",m
3913,Your head will be all right again in a day or so.,m
3914,Do you want anything to eat?,m
3915,It's near dinner-time.,m
3916,"I suppose we can't let you starve--though you deserve it.""",m
3917,"""Thanks, I want nothing!"" said Ste.",m
3918,Marie.,m
3919,"""Pray don't trouble about me!""",m
3920,"The other man nodded again indifferently, and turned to go out of the room, but in the doorway he halted and looked back.",m
3921,"""As we're to have the pleasure of your company for some time to come,"" said he, ""you might suggest a name to call you by.",m
3922,"Of course I don't expect you to tell your own name, though I can learn that easily enough.""",m
3923,"""Easily enough, to be sure,"" said the man on the bed.",m
3924,"""Ask Stewart.",m
3925,"He knows only too well.""",m
3926,The Irishman scowled.,m
3927,"And after a moment he said--  ""I don't know any Stewart.""",m
3928,But at that Ste.,m
3929,"Marie gave a laugh, and a tinge of red came over the Irishman's cheeks.",m
3930,"""And so to save Captain Stewart the trouble,"" continued the wounded man, ""I'll tell you my name with pleasure.",m
3931,I don't know why I shouldn't.,m
3932,It's Ste.,m
3933,"Marie.""",m
3934,"""What?"" cried O'Hara hoarsely.",m
3935,"""What?",m
3936,"Say that again!""",m
3937,"He came forward a swift step or two into the room, and he stared at the man on the bed as if he were staring at a ghost.",m
3938,"""Ste.",m
3939,"Marie?"" he cried in a whisper.",m
3940,"""It's impossible!",m
3941,"""What are you,"" he demanded, ""to Gilles, Comte de Ste.",m
3942,Marie de Mont-Perdu?,m
3943,"What are you to him?""",m
3944,"""He was my father,"" said the younger man, ""but he is dead.",m
3945,"He has been dead for ten years.""",m
3946,"He turned his head with a little grimace of pain to look curiously after the Irishman, who had all at once turned away across the room, and stood still beside a window, with bent head.",m
3947,"""Why?"" he questioned.",m
3948,"""What about my father?",m
3949,"Why did you ask that?""",m
3950,"O'Hara did not answer at once, and he did not stir from his place by the window, but after awhile he said--  ""I knew him ...",m
3951,"That's all.""",m
3952,"And after another space he came back beside the bed, and once more looked down upon the young man who lay there.",m
3953,"His face was veiled, inscrutable.",m
3954,It betrayed nothing.,m
3955,"""You have a look of your father,"" said he.",m
3956,"""That was what puzzled me a little.",m
3957,I was just saying to----I was just thinking that there was something familiar about you....,m
3958,Ah well! we've all come down in the world since then.,m
3959,The Ste.,m
3960,Marie blood though!,m
3961,"Who'd have thought it!""",m
3962,"The man shook his head a little sorrowfully, but Ste.",m
3963,Marie stared up at him in frowning incomprehension.,m
3964,The pain had dulled him somewhat.,m
3965,And presently O'Hara again moved towards the door.,m
3966,"On the way he said--  ""I'll bring or send you something to eat--not too much.",m
3967,And later on I'll give you a sleeping powder.,m
3968,With that head of yours you may have trouble in getting to sleep.,m
3969,"Understand, I'm doing this for your father's son, and not because you've any right yourself to consideration.""",m
3970,Ste.,m
3971,"Marie raised himself with difficulty, on one elbow.",m
3972,"""Wait!"" said he.",m
3973,"""Wait a moment!"" and the other halted just inside the door.",m
3974,"""You seem to have known my father,"" said Ste.",m
3975,"Marie, ""and to have respected him.",m
3976,"For my father's sake will you listen to me for five minutes?""",m
3977,"""No, I won't!"" said the Irishman sharply, ""so you may as well hold your tongue.",m
3978,Nothing you can say to me or to any one in this house will have the slightest effect.,m
3979,We know what you came spying here for.,m
3980,"We know all about it.""",m
3981,"""Yes,"" said Ste.",m
3982,"Marie with a little sigh, and he fell back upon the pillows.",m
3983,"""Yes, I suppose you do.",m
3984,I was rather a fool to speak.,m
3985,You wouldn't all be doing what you're doing if words could affect you.,m
3986,"I was a fool to speak.""",m
3987,"The Irishman stared at him for another moment and went out of the room, closing the door behind him.",m
3988,"So he was left once more alone to his pain and his bitter self-reproaches, and his wild and futile plans for escape.",m
3989,But O'Hara returned in an hour or thereabouts with food for him--a cup of broth and a slice of bread; and when Ste.,m
3990,"Marie had eaten these, the Irishman looked once more to his wounded leg, and gave him a sleeping powder dissolved in water.",m
3991,"He lay restless and wide-eyed for an hour, and then drifted away through intermediate mists into a sleep full of horrible dreams, but it was at least relief from bodily suffering; and when he awoke in the morning his headache was almost gone.",m
3992,"He awoke to sunshine and fresh sweet odours, and the twittering of birds.",m
3993,"By good chance O'Hara had been the last to enter the room on the evening before, and so no one had come to close the shutters or draw the blinds.",m
3994,"The windows were open wide, and the morning breeze, very soft and aromatic, blew in and out and filled the place with sweetness.",m
3995,"The room was a corner room with windows that looked south and east, and the early sun slanted in and lay in golden squares across the floor.",m
3996,Ste.,m
3997,Marie opened his eyes with none of the dazed bewilderment that he might have expected.,m
3998,The events of the preceding day came back to him instantly and without shock.,m
3999,"He put up an experimental hand and found that his head was still very sore where he had struck it in falling, but the ache was almost gone.",m
4000,"He tried to stir his leg, and a protesting pain shot through it.",m
4001,"It burned dully even when it was quiet, but the pain was not at all severe.",m
4002,"He realised that he was to get off rather well, considering what might have happened, and he was so grateful for this that he almost forgot to be angry with himself over his monumental folly.",m
4003,A small bird chased by another wheeled in through the southern window and back again into free air.,m
4004,"Finally the two settled down upon the parapet of the little shallow balcony, which was there, to have their disagreement out, and they talked it over with a great deal of noise and many threatening gestures and a complete loss of temper on both sides.",m
4005,Ste.,m
4006,"Marie, from his bed, cheered them on, but there came a commotion in the ivy which draped the wall below, and the two birds fled in ignominious haste, and just in the nick of time, for when the cause of the commotion shot into view, it was a large black cat of great bodily activity and an ardent single-heartedness of aim.",m
4007,"The black cat gazed for a moment resentfully after its vanished prey, and then composed its sleek body upon the iron rail, tail and paws tucked neatly under.",m
4008,Ste.,m
4009,"Marie chirruped, and the cat turned yellow eyes upon him in mild astonishment as one who should say--  ""Who the deuce are you, and what the deuce are you doing here?""",m
4010,"He chirruped again, and the cat, after an ostentatious yawn and stretch, came to him--beating up to windward, as it were, and making the bed in three tacks.",m
4011,"When O'Hara entered the room some time later he found his patient in a very cheerful frame of mind, and the black cat sitting on his chest, purring like a dynamo and kneading like an industrious baker.",m
4012,"""Ho!"" said the Irishman, ""you seem to have found a friend.""",m
4013,"""Well, I need one friend here,"" argued Ste.",m
4014,Marie.,m
4015,"""I'm in the enemy's stronghold.",m
4016,"You needn't be alarmed: the cat can't tell me anything, and it can't help me to escape.",m
4017,It can only sit on me and purr.,m
4018,"That's harmless enough.""",m
4019,"O'Hara began one of his gruff laughs, but he seemed to remember himself in the middle of it, and assumed an intimidating scowl instead.",m
4020,"""How's the leg?"" he demanded shortly.",m
4021,"""Let me see it!""",m
4022,He took off the bandages and cleansed and sprayed the wound with some antiseptic liquid that he had brought in a bottle.,m
4023,"""There's a little fever,"" said he, ""but that can't be avoided.",m
4024,"You're going on very well--a good deal better than you'd any right to expect.""",m
4025,He had to inflict not a little pain in his examination and redressing of the wound.,m
4026,"He knew that, and once or twice he glanced up at Ste.",m
4027,Marie's face with a sort of reluctant admiration for the man who could bear so much without any sign whatever.,m
4028,In the end he put together his things and nodded with professional satisfaction.,m
4029,"""You'll do well enough now for the rest of the day,"" he said.",m
4030,"""I'll send up old Michel to valet you.",m
4031,"He's the gardener who shot you yesterday, and he may take it into his head to finish the job this morning.",m
4032,"If he does I shan't try to stop him.""",m
4033,"""Nor I,"" said Ste.",m
4034,Marie.,m
4035,"""Thanks very much for your trouble.",m
4036,"An excellent surgeon was lost in you.""",m
4037,"O'Hara left the room, and presently the old caretaker, one-eyed, gnome-like, shambling like a bear, sidled into the room and proceeded to set things to rights.",m
4038,"He looked, Ste.",m
4039,"Marie said to himself, like something in an old German drawing, or in those imitations of old drawings that one sometimes sees nowadays in Fliegende Blatter.",m
4040,"He tried to make the strange creature talk, but Michel went about his task with an air half frightened, half stolid, and refused to speak more than an occasional ""oui"" or a ""bien, monsieur,"" in answer to orders.",m
4041,Ste.,m
4042,"Marie asked if he might have some coffee and bread, and the old Michel nodded and slipped from the room as silently as he had entered it.",m
4043,Thereafter Ste.,m
4044,"Marie trifled with the cat and got one hand well scratched for his trouble, but in five minutes there came a knocking at the door.",m
4045,He laughed a little.,m
4046,"""Michel grows ceremonious when it's a question of food,"" he said.",m
4047,"""Entrez, mon vieux!""",m
4048,"The door opened, and Ste.",m
4049,Marie caught his breath.,m
4050,"""Michel is busy,"" said Coira O'Hara, ""so I have brought your coffee.""",m
4051,"[Illustration: ""'Michel is busy,' said Coira O'Hara, 'so I have brought your coffee.'""]  She came into the sunlit room, holding the steaming bowl of cafe au lait before her in her two hands.",m
4052,"Over it her eyes went out to the man who lay in his bed, a long and steady and very grave look.",m
4053,"""A goddess that lady, a queen among goddesses,""--thus the little Jew of the Boulevard de la Madeleine.",m
4054,Ste.,m
4055,"Marie gazed back at her, and his heart was sick within him to think of the contemptible role Fate had laid upon this girl to play: the candle to the moth, the bait to the eager unskilled fish, the lure to charm a foolish boy.",m
4056,"The girl's splendid beauty seemed to fill all that bright room with, as it were, a richer subtler light.",m
4057,There could be no doubt of her potency.,m
4058,Older and wiser heads than young Arthur Benham's might well forget the world for her.,m
4059,Ste.,m
4060,"Marie watched, and the heartsickness within him was like a physical pain keen and bitter.",m
4061,"He thought of that first and only previous meeting--the single minute in the Champs Elysees when her eyes had held him, had seemed to beseech him out of some deep agony.",m
4062,"He thought of how they had haunted him afterwards both by day and by night--calling eyes--and he gave a little groan of sheer bitterness, for he realised that all this while she was laying her snares about the feet of an inexperienced boy, decoying him to his ruin.",m
4063,"There was a name for such women, an ugly name.",m
4064,They were called adventuresses.,m
4065,The girl set the bowl which she carried down upon a table not far from the bed.,m
4066,"""You will need a tray or something,"" said she.",m
4067,"""I suppose you can sit up against your pillows?",m
4068,"I'll bring a tray, and you can hold it on your knees and eat from it.""",m
4069,She spoke in a tone of very deliberate indifference and detachment.,m
4070,"There seemed even to be an edge of scorn in it, but nothing could make that deep and golden voice harsh or unlovely.",m
4071,"As the girl's extraordinary beauty had filled all the room with its light, so the sound of her voice seemed to fill it with a sumptuous and hushed resonance like a temple bell muffled in velvet.",m
4072,"""I must bring something to eat too,"" she said.",m
4073,"""Would you prefer croissants or brioches or plain bread and butter?",m
4074,"You might as well have what you like.""",m
4075,"""Thank you!"" said Ste.",m
4076,Marie.,m
4077,"""It doesn't matter.",m
4078,Anything.,m
4079,You are most kind.,m
4080,"You are Hebe, mademoiselle, server of feasts.""",m
4081,"The girl turned her head for a moment, and looked at him with some surprise.",m
4082,"""If I am not mistaken,"" she said, ""Hebe served to gods.""",m
4083,"Then she went out of the room, and Ste.",m
4084,Marie broke into a sudden delighted laugh behind her.,m
4085,She would seem to be a young woman with a tongue in her head.,m
4086,She had seized the rash opening without an instant's hesitation.,m
4087,"The black cat, which had been cruising, after the inquisitive fashion of its kind, in far corners of the room, strolled back and looked up to the table where the bowl of coffee steamed and waited.",m
4088,"""Get out!"" cried Ste.",m
4089,Marie.,m
4090,"""Va t'en, sale petit animal!",m
4091,Go and eat birds! that's my coffee.,m
4092,Va!,m
4093,Sauve toi!,m
4094,"He voleur que tu es!""",m
4095,"He sought for something by way of missile, but there was nothing within reach.",m
4096,"The black cat turned its calm and yellow eyes towards him, looked back to the aromatic feast, and leapt expertly to the top of the table.",m
4097,Ste.,m
4098,Marie shouted and made horrible threats.,m
4099,"He waved an impotent pillow, not daring to hurl it for fear of smashing the table's entire contents, but the black cat did not even glance towards him.",m
4100,"It smelt the coffee, sneezed over it because it was hot, and finally proceeded to lap very daintily, pausing often to take breath or to shake its head, for cats disapprove of hot dishes, though they will partake of them at a pinch.",m
4101,"There came a step outside the door, and the thief leapt down with some haste, yet not quite in time to escape observation.",m
4102,Mlle.,m
4103,O'Hara came in breathing terrible threats.,m
4104,"""Has that wretched animal touched your coffee?"" she cried.",m
4105,"""I hope not.""",m
4106,"But Ste Marie laughed weakly from his bed, and the guilty beast stood in mid-floor, brown drops beading its black chin and hanging upon its whiskers.",m
4107,"""I did what I could, mademoiselle,"" said Ste.",m
4108,Marie;,m
4109,"""but there was nothing to throw.",m
4110,"I am sorry to be the cause of so much trouble.""",m
4111,"""It is nothing,"" said she.",m
4112,"""I will bring some more coffee, only it will take ten minutes, because I shall have to make some fresh.""",m
4113,"She made as if she would smile a little in answer to him, but her face turned grave once more, and she went out of the room with averted eyes.",m
4114,Thereafter Ste.,m
4115,"Marie occupied himself with watching idly the movements of the black cat, and as he watched something icy cold began to grow within him, a sensation more terrible than he had ever known before.",m
4116,"He found himself shivering as if that summer day had all at once turned to January, and he found that his face was wet with a chill perspiration.",m
4117,"When the girl at length returned she found him lying still, his face to the wall.",m
4118,"The black cat was in her path as she crossed the room, so that she had to thrust it out of the way with her foot, and she called it names for moving with such lethargy.",m
4119,"""Here is the coffee at last,"" she said.",m
4120,"""I made it fresh.",m
4121,And I have brought some brioches.,m
4122,"Will you sit up and have the tray on your knees?""",m
4123,"""Thank you!"" said Ste.",m
4124,Marie.,m
4125,"""I do not wish anything.""",m
4126,"""You do not----"" she repeated after him.",m
4127,"""But I have made the coffee especially for you!"" she protested.",m
4128,"""I thought you wanted it.",m
4129,"I don't understand.""",m
4130,With a sudden movement the man turned towards her a white and drawn face.,m
4131,"""Mademoiselle!"" he cried, ""it would have been more merciful to let your gardener shoot again yesterday.",m
4132,"Much more merciful, mademoiselle.""",m
4133,She stared at him under her straight black brows.,m
4134,"""What do you mean?"" she demanded.",m
4135,"""More merciful?",m
4136,"What do you mean by that?""",m
4137,Ste.,m
4138,Marie stretched out a pointing finger and the girl followed it.,m
4139,"She gave, after a tense instant, a single sharp scream.",m
4140,"And upon that--  ""No! no!",m
4141,It's not true.,m
4142,"It's not possible.""",m
4143,"Moving stiffly she set down the bowl she carried, and the hot liquid splashed up round her wrists.",m
4144,"For a moment she hung there, drooping, holding herself up by the strength of her hands upon the table.",m
4145,It was as if she had been seized with faintness.,m
4146,Then she sprang to where the cat crouched beside a chair.,m
4147,"She dropped upon her knees and tried to raise it in her arms, but the beast bit and scratched at her feebly, and crept away to a little distance, where it lay struggling and very unpleasant to see.",m
4148,"""Poison!"" she said in a choked gasping whisper.",m
4149,"""Poison!""",m
4150,"She looked once towards the man upon the bed, and she was white and shivering.",m
4151,"""It's not true!"" she cried again.",m
4152,"""I--won't believe it.",m
4153,It's because the cat--was not used to coffee.,m
4154,Because it was hot.,m
4155,I won't believe it.,m
4156,"I won't believe it.""",m
4157,"She began to sob, holding her hands over her white face.",m
4158,Ste.,m
4159,Marie watched her with puzzled eyes.,m
4160,"If this was acting, it was very very good acting.",m
4161,"A little glimmer of hope began to burn in him--hope that in this last shameful thing, at least, the girl had had no part.",m
4162,"""It's impossible!"" she insisted piteously.",m
4163,"""I tell you it's impossible.",m
4164,I brought the coffee myself from the kitchen.,m
4165,I took it from the pot there--the same pot we had all had ours from.,m
4166,"It was never out of my sight--or, that is--I mean----""  She halted there and Ste.",m
4167,"Marie saw her eyes turn slowly towards the door, and he saw a crimson flush come up over her cheeks and die away, leaving her white again.",m
4168,"He drew a little breath of relief and gladness, for he was sure of her now.",m
4169,She had had no part in it.,m
4170,"""It is nothing, mademoiselle,"" said he cheerfully.",m
4171,"""Think no more of it.",m
4172,"It is nothing.""",m
4173,"""Nothing?"" she cried in a loud voice.",m
4174,"""Do you call poison nothing?""",m
4175,She began to shiver again very violently.,m
4176,"""You would have drunk it!"" she said, staring at him in a white agony.",m
4177,"""But for a miracle you would have drunk it--and died!""",m
4178,Abruptly she came beside the bed and threw herself upon her knees there.,m
4179,In her excitement and horror she seemed to have forgotten what they two were to each other.,m
4180,She caught him by the shoulders with her two hands and the girl's violent trembling shook them both.,m
4181,"""Will you believe,"" she cried, ""that I had nothing to do with this?",m
4182,Will you believe me?,m
4183,"You must believe me!""",m
4184,There was no acting in that moment.,m
4185,"She was wrung with a frank anguish and utter horror, and between her words there were hard and terrible sobs.",m
4186,"""I believe you, mademoiselle,"" said the man gently.",m
4187,"""I believe you.",m
4188,"Pray think no more about it!""",m
4189,"He smiled up into the girl's beautiful face, though within him he was still cold and ashiver, as even the bravest men might well be at such an escape, and after a moment she turned away again.",m
4190,"With unsteady hands she put the new-made bowl of coffee and the brioches and other things together upon the tray, and started to carry it across the room to the bed, but halfway she turned back again and set the tray down.",m
4191,"She looked about and found an empty glass, and she poured a little of the coffee into it.",m
4192,Ste.,m
4193,"Marie, who was watching her, gave a sudden cry--  ""No! no! mademoiselle, I beg you.",m
4194,"You must not!""",m
4195,But the girl shook her head at him gravely over the glass.,m
4196,"""There is no danger,"" she said, ""but I must be sure.""",m
4197,"She drank what was in the glass, and afterwards went across to one of the windows and stood there with her back to the room for a little time.",m
4198,In the end she returned and once more brought the breakfast tray to the bed.,m
4199,Ste.,m
4200,"Marie raised himself to a sitting posture, and took the thing upon his knees, but his hands were shaking.",m
4201,"""If I were not as helpless as a dead man, mademoiselle,"" said he, ""you should not have done that.",m
4202,"If I could have stopped you, you should not have done it, mademoiselle.""",m
4203,"A wave of colour spread up under the brown skin of the girl's face, but she did not speak.",m
4204,"She stood by for a moment to see if he was supplied with everything he needed, and when Ste.",m
4205,Marie expressed his gratitude for her pains she only bowed her head.,m
4206,Then presently she turned away and left the room.,m
4207,Outside the door she met some one who was approaching.,m
4208,Ste.,m
4209,"Marie heard her break into rapid and excited speech, and he heard O'Hara's voice in answer.",m
4210,"The voice expressed astonishment and indignation and a sort of gruff horror, but the man who listened could hear only the tones not the words that were spoken.",m
4211,The Irishman came quickly into the room.,m
4212,He glanced once towards the bed where Ste.,m
4213,"Marie sat eating his breakfast with apparent unconcern (there may have been a little bravado in this), and then bent over the thing which lay moving feebly beside a chair.",m
4214,"When he rose again his face was hard and tense, and his blue eyes glittered in a fashion that boded trouble for somebody.",m
4215,"""This looks very bad for us,"" he said gruffly.",m
4216,"""I should--I should like to have you believe that neither my daughter nor I had any part in it.",m
4217,"When I fight I fight openly, I don't use poison.",m
4218,"Not even with spies.""",m
4219,"""Oh, that's all right!"" said Ste.",m
4220,"Marie, taking an ostentatious sip of coffee.",m
4221,"""That's understood.",m
4222,I know well enough who tried to poison me.,m
4223,"If you'll just keep your friend Stewart out of the kitchen, I shan't worry about my food.""",m
4224,"The Irishman's cheeks reddened with a quick flush, and he dropped his eyes.",m
4225,"But in an instant he raised them again, and looked full into the eyes of the man who sat in bed.",m
4226,"""You seem,"" said he, ""to be labouring under a curious misapprehension.",m
4227,"There is no Stewart here, and I don't know any man of that name.""",m
4228,Ste.,m

4230,"""Oh, don't you?"" he said.",m
4231,"""That's my mistake then.",m

4233,"You have interests in common.""",m
4234,O'Hara favoured his patient with a long and frowning stare.,m
4235,"But at the end he turned without a word and went out of the room.                                                             That meeting with Richard Hartley of which Captain Stewart, in the small drawing-room at La Lierre, spoke to the Irishman O'Hara, took place at Stewart's own door in the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
4236,"Honore, and it must have been at just about the time when Ste.",m

4239,"Hartley had lunched at Durand's with his friends, whose name--though it does not at all matter here--was Reeves-Davis, and after lunch the four of them, Major and Lady Reeves-Davis, Reeves-Davis' sister Mrs. Carsten, and Hartley, spent an hour at a certain picture dealer's near the Madeleine.",m
4240,"After that Lady Reeves-Davis wanted to go in search of an antiquary's shop which was somewhere in the Rue du Faubourg, and she did not know just where.",m
4241,"They went in from the Rue Royale, and amused themselves by looking at the attractive windows on the way.",m
4242,"During one of their frequent halts, while the two ladies were passionately absorbed in a display of hats and Reeves-Davis was making derisive comments from the rear, Hartley, who was too much bored to pay attention, saw a figure which seemed to him familiar emerge from an adjacent doorway, and start to cross the pavement to a large touring car with the top up, which stood at the kerb.",m
4243,"The man wore a dust-coat and a cap, and he moved as if he were in a hurry, but as he went he cast a quick look about him, and his eye fell upon Richard Hartley.",m
4244,"Hartley nodded, and he thought the elder man gave a violent start--but then he looked very white and ill and might have started at anything.",m
4245,"For an instant Captain Stewart made as if he would go on his way without taking notice, but the seemed to change his mind and turned back.",m
4246,"He held out his hand with a rather wan and nervous smile, saying--  ""Ah, Hartley!",m

4255,"You've seen him since I have, as a matter of fact.",m
4256,"He came to your party last night, didn't he?",m
4257,Sorry I couldn't come.,m
4258,"They must have tired you out, I should think.",m
4259,"You look ill.""",m
4260,"""Yes,"" said the other man absently.",m
4261,"""Yes.",m
4262,"I had an attack of--an old malady, last night.",m
4263,I am rather stale to-day.,m
4264,You say you haven't seen Ste.,m
4265,Marie?,m
4266,"No, to be sure.",m
4267,If you see him later on you might say that I mean to drop in on him to-morrow to make my apologies.,m
4268,He'll understand.,m
4269,"Good day!""",m
4270,"So he turned away to the motor, which was waiting for him, and Hartley went back to his friends, wondering a little what it was that Stewart had to apologise for.",m
4271,As for Captain Stewart he must have gone at once out to La Lierre.,m
4272,What he found there has already been set forth.,m
4273,"It was about ten that evening when Hartley, who had left his people, after dinner was over, at the Marigny, reached the Rue d'Assas.",m
4274,"The street door was already closed for the night, and so he had to ring for the cordon.",m
4275,"When the door clicked open and he had closed it behind him, he called out his name before crossing the court to Ste.",m
4276,"Marie's stair, but as he went on his way the voice of the concierge reached him from the little loge.",m
4277,"""M. Ste.",m
4278,"Marie n'est pas la.""",m
4279,"Now the Parisian concierge, as every one knows who has lived under his iron sway, is a being set apart from the rest of mankind.",m
4280,"He has, in general no human attributes, and certainly no human sympathy.",m
4281,His hand is against all the world and the hand of all the world is against him.,m
4282,"Still, here and there amongst this peculiar race are to be found a very few beings who are of softer substance--men and women instead of spies and harpies.",m
4283,The concierge who had charge of the house wherein Ste.,m
4284,"Marie dwelt was an old woman, undeniably severe upon occasion, but for the most part a kindly and even jovial soul.",m
4285,She must have become a concierge through some unfortunate mistake.,m
4286,"She snapped open her little square window, and stuck out into the moonlit court a dishevelled grey head.",m
4287,"""Il n'est pas la,"" she said again, beaming upon Richard Hartley, whom she liked, and when he protested that he had a definite and important appointment with her lodger, went on to explain that Ste.",m
4288,"Marie had gone out, doubtless to lunch, before one o'clock and had never returned.",m
4289,"""He may have left word for me upstairs,"" Hartley said.",m
4290,"""I'll go up and wait, if I may.""",m
4291,"So the woman got him her extra key, and he went up, let himself into the flat and made lights there.",m
4292,"Naturally he found no word, but his own note of that morning lay spread out upon a table where Ste.",m
4293,"Marie had left it, and so he knew that his friend was in possession of the two facts he had learnt about Stewart.",m
4294,"He made himself comfortable with a book and some cigarettes, and settled down to wait.",m
4295,Ste.,m
4296,"Marie out at La Lierre, with a bullet hole in his leg, was deep in a drugged sleep just then, but Hartley waited for him, looking up now and then from his book with a scowl of impatience, until the little clock on the mantle said that it was one o'clock.",m
4297,"Then he went home in a very bad temper, after writing another note, and leaving it on the table, to say that he would return early in the morning.",m
4298,But in the morning he began to be alarmed.,m
4299,He questioned the concierge very closely as to Ste.,m
4300,"Marie's movements on the day previous, but she could tell him little (save to mention the brief visit of a man with an accent of Toulouse or Marseille), and there seemed to be no one else to whom he could go.",m
4301,He spent the entire morning in the flat and returned there after a hasty lunch.,m
4302,But at mid-afternoon he took a fiacre at the corner of the Gardens and drove to the Rue du Faubourg St.,m
4303,Honore.,m
4304,Captain Stewart was at home.,m
4305,He was in a dressing-gown and still looked fagged and unwell.,m
4306,"He certainly betrayed some surprise at sight of his visitor, but he made Hartley welcome at once, and insisted upon having cigars and things to drink brought out for him.",m
4307,"On the whole he presented an astonishingly normal exterior, for within him he must have been cold with fear, and in his ears a question must have rung and shouted and rung again unceasingly.--  ""What does this fellow know?",m
4308,"What does he know?""",m
4309,Hartley's very presence there had a perilous look.,m
4310,The younger man shook his head at the servant who asked him what he wished to drink.,m
4311,"""Thanks, you're very good,"" he said to Captain Stewart, and that gentleman eyed him silently.",m
4312,"""I can't stay but a moment.",m
4313,I just dropped in to ask if you'd any idea what can have become of Ste.,m
4314,"Marie.""",m
4315,"""Ste.",m
4316,"Marie?"" said Captain Stewart.",m
4317,"""What do you mean--'become of him'?""",m
4318,"He moistened his lips to speak, but he said the words without a tremor.",m
4319,"""Well, what I meant, was,"" said Hartley, ""that you'd seen him last.",m
4320,He was here Thursday evening.,m
4321,Did he say anything to you about going anywhere in particular the next day--yesterday?,m
4322,"He left his rooms about noon and hasn't turned up since.""",m
4323,"Captain Stewart drew a short breath and sat down abruptly in a near-by chair, for all at once his knees had begun to tremble under him.",m
4324,"He was conscious of a great and blissful wave of relief and well-being, and he wanted to laugh.",m
4325,He wanted so much to laugh that it became a torture to keep his face in repose.,m
4326,"So Ste Marie had left no word behind him, and the danger was past!",m
4327,"With a great effort he looked up from where he sat to Richard Hartley, who stood anxious and frowning before him.",m
4328,"""Forgive me for sitting down!"" he said, ""and sit down yourself, I beg!",m
4329,I'm still very shaky from my attack of illness.,m
4330,Ste.,m
4331,Marie?,m
4332,Ste.,m
4333,Marie has disappeared?,m
4334,How very extraordinary!,m
4335,It's like poor Arthur.,m
4336,Still--a single day!,m
4337,"He might be anywhere for a single day, might he not?",m
4338,"For all that, though, it's very odd.",m
4339,Why no!,m
4340,"No, I don't think he said anything about going away!",m
4341,"At least I remember nothing about it.""",m
4342,The relief and triumph within him burst out in a sudden little chuckle of malicious fun.,m
4343,"""I can think of only one thing,"" said he, ""that might be of use to you.",m
4344,Ste.,m
4345,Marie seemed to take a very great fancy to one of the ladies here the other evening.,m
4346,"And, I must confess, the lady seemed to return it.",m
4347,It had all the look of a desperate flirtation--a most desperate flirtation.,m
4348,They spent the evening in a corner together.,m
4349,"""You don't suppose,"" he said, still chuckling gently, ""that Ste.",m
4350,"Marie is taking a little holiday, do you?",m
4351,"You don't suppose that lady could account for him?""",m
4352,"""No,"" said Richard Hartley, ""I don't.",m
4353,And if you knew Ste.,m
4354,"Marie a little better you wouldn't suppose it either.""",m
4355,"But after a pause he said--  ""Could you give me the--lady's name, by any chance?",m
4356,"Of course I don't want to leave any stone unturned.""",m
4357,And once more the other man emitted his pleased little chuckle that was so like a cat's mew.,m
4358,"""I can give you her name,"" said he.",m
4359,"""The name is Mademoiselle----Bertrand.",m
4360,Elise Bertrand.,m
4361,But I regret to say I haven't the address by me.,m
4362,She came with some friends.,m
4363,I will try to get it and send it you.,m
4364,"Will that be all right?""",m
4365,"""Yes, thanks!"" said Richard Hartley.",m
4366,"""You're very good.",m
4367,And now I must be going on.,m
4368,"I'm rather in a hurry.""",m
4369,"Captain Stewart protested against this great haste, and pressed the younger man to sit down and tell him more about his friend's disappearance, but Hartley excused himself, repeating that he was in a great hurry, and went off.",m
4370,"When he had gone Captain Stewart lay back in his chair and laughed until he was weak and ached from it, the furious helpless laughter which comes after the sudden release from a terrible strain.",m
4371,"He was not, as a rule, a demonstrative man, but he became aware that he would like to dance and sing, and probably he would have done both if it had not been for the servant in the next room.",m
4372,"So there was no danger to be feared, and his terrors of the night past--he shivered a little to think of them--had been after all useless terrors!",m
4373,As for the prisoner out at La Lierre nothing was to be feared from him so long as a careful watch was kept.,m
4374,"Later on he might have to be disposed of, since both bullet and poison had failed (he scowled over that, remembering a bad quarter of an hour with O'Hara early this morning), but that matter could wait.",m
4375,Some way would present itself.,m
4376,"He thought of the wholly gratuitous lie he had told Hartley, a thing born of a moment's malice, and he laughed again.",m
4377,It struck him that it would be very humorous if Hartley should come to suspect his friend of turning aside from his great endeavours to enter upon an affair with a lady.,m
4378,He dimly remembered that Ste.,m
4379,"Marie's name had, from time to time, been a good deal involved in romantic histories, and he said to himself that his lie had been very well chosen indeed, and might be expected to cause Richard Hartley much anguish of spirit.",m
4380,"After that he lighted a very large cigarette, half as big as a cigar, and he lay back in his low comfortable chair, and began to think of the outcome of all this plotting and planning.",m
4381,"As is very apt to be the case when a great danger has been escaped, he was in a mood of extreme hopefulness and confidence.",m
4382,"Vaguely he felt as if the recent happenings had set him ahead a pace towards his goal, though, of course, they had done nothing of the kind.",m
4383,The danger that would exist so long as Ste.,m
4384,"Marie, who knew everything, was alive, seemed in some miraculous fashion to have dwindled to insignificance; in this rebound from fear and despair, difficulties were swept away and the path was clear.",m
4385,"The man's mind leapt to his goal, and a little shiver of prospective joy ran over him.",m
4386,Once that goal gained he could defy the world.,m
4387,"Let eyes look askance, let tongues wag, he would be safe then--safe for all the rest of his life, and rich, rich, rich!",m
4388,For he was playing against a feeble old man's life.,m
4389,"Day by day he watched the low flame sink lower, as the flame of an exhausted lamp sinks and flickers.",m
4390,"It was slow, for the old man had still a little strength left, but the will to live--which was the oil in the lamp--was almost gone and the waiting could not be long now.",m
4391,"One day, quite suddenly, the flame would sink down to almost nothing, as at last it does in the spent lamp.",m
4392,"It would flicker up and down rapidly for a few moments, and all at once there would be no flame there.",m
4393,"Old David would be dead, and a servant would be sent across the river in haste to the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
4394,Honore.,m
4395,"Stewart lay back in his chair and tried to imagine that it was true, that it had already happened, as happen it must before long, and once more the little shiver which was like a shiver of voluptuous delight ran up and down his limbs, and his breath began to come fast and hard.",m
4396,But Richard Hartley drove at once back to the Rue d'Assas.,m
4397,"He was not very much disappointed in having learnt nothing from Stewart, though he was thoroughly angry at that gentleman's hint about Ste.",m
4398,Marie and the unknown lady.,m
4399,"He had gone to the Rue du Faubourg because, as he had said, he wished to leave no stone unturned, and, after all, he had thought it quite possible that Stewart could give him some information which would be of value.",m
4400,"Hartley firmly believed the elder man to be a rascal, but, of course, he knew nothing definite save the two facts which he had accidentally learnt from Helen Benham, and it had occurred to him that Captain Stewart might have sent Ste.",m
4401,Marie off upon another wild-goose chase such as the expedition to Dinard had been.,m
4402,He would have been sure that the elder man had had something do to with Ste.,m
4403,"Marie's disappearance if the latter had not been seen since Stewart's party, but instead of that Ste.",m
4404,"Marie had come home, slept, gone out the next morning, returned again, received a visitor, and gone out to lunch.",m
4405,It was all very puzzling and mysterious.,m
4406,His mind went back to the brief interview with Stewart and dwelt upon it.,m
4407,Little things which had at the time made no impression upon him began to recur and to take on significance.,m
4408,"He remembered the elder man's odd and strained manner at the beginning, his sudden and causeless change to ease and a something that was almost like a triumphant excitement, and then his absurd story about Ste.",m
4409,Marie's flirtation with a lady.,m
4410,"Hartley thought of these things, he thought also of the fact that Ste.",m
4411,Marie had disappeared immediately after hearing grave accusations against Stewart.,m
4412,"Could he have lost his head, rushed across the city at once to confront the middle-aged villain, and then--disappeared from human ken?",m
4413,It would have been very like him to do something rashly impulsive upon reading that note.,m
4414,Hartley broke into a sudden laugh of sheer amusement when he realised to what a wild and improbable flight his fancy was soaring.,m
4415,"He could not quite rid himself of a feeling that Stewart was, in some mysterious fashion, responsible for his friend's vanishing.",m
4416,But he was unlike Ste.,m
4417,"Marie; he did not trust his feelings, either good or bad, unless they were backed by excellent evidence, and he had to admit that there was not a single scrap of evidence, in this instance, against Miss Benham's uncle.",m
4418,The girl's name recalled him to another duty.,m
4419,He must tell her about Ste.,m
4420,Marie.,m
4421,He was by this time halfway up the Boulevard St.,m
4422,"Germain, but he gave a new order and the fiacre turned back to the Rue de l'Universite.",m
4423,"The footman at the door said that mademoiselle was not in the drawing-room, as it was only four o'clock, but that he thought she was in the house.",m
4424,So Hartley sent up his name and went in to wait.,m
4425,Miss Benham came down looking a little pale and anxious.,m
4426,"""I've been with grandfather,"" she explained.",m
4427,"""He had some sort of sinking spell last night, and we were very much frightened.",m
4428,"He's much better, but--well he couldn't have many such spells and live.",m
4429,"I'm afraid he grows a good deal weaker, day by day, now.",m
4430,"He sees hardly any one outside the family, except Baron de Vries.""",m
4431,She sat down with a little sigh of fatigue and smiled up at her visitor.,m
4432,"""I'm glad you've come,"" said she.",m
4433,"""You'll cheer me up and I rather need it.",m
4434,"What are you looking so solemn about, though?",m
4435,"You won't cheer me up if you look like that.""",m
4436,"""Well, you see,"" said Hartley, ""I came at this impossible hour to bring you some bad news.",m
4437,I'm sorry.,m
4438,"""Perhaps,"" he conditioned, ""bad news is putting it with too much seriousness.",m
4439,Strange news is better.,m
4440,"To be brief, Ste.",m
4441,Marie has disappeared--vanished into thin air.,m
4442,"I thought you ought to know.""",m
4443,"""Ste.",m
4444,"Marie!"" cried the girl.",m
4445,"""How?",m
4446,What do you mean--vanished?,m
4447,"When did he vanish?""",m
4448,She gave a sudden exclamation of relief.,m
4449,"""Oh, he has come upon some clue or other and has rushed off to follow it.",m
4450,"That's all--How dare you frighten me so?""",m
4451,"""He went without luggage,"" said the man, shaking his head, ""and he left no word of any kind behind him.",m
4452,"He went out to lunch yesterday about noon, and, as I said, simply vanished, leaving no trace whatever behind him.",m
4453,"I've just been to see your uncle, thinking that he might know something, but he doesn't.""",m
4454,The girl looked up quickly.,m
4455,"""My uncle?"" she said.",m
4456,"""Why my uncle?""",m
4457,"""Well,"" said Hartley, ""you see Ste.",m
4458,"Marie went to a little party at your uncle's flat on the night before he disappeared, and I thought your uncle might have heard him say something that would throw light on his movements the next day.""",m
4459,"Hartley remembered the unfortunate incident of the galloping pigs, and hurried on--  ""He went to the party more for the purpose of having a talk with your uncle than for any other reason, I think.",m
4460,"I was to have gone myself, but gave it up at the eleventh hour for the Cain's dinner at Armenonville.",m
4461,"""Well, the next morning after Captain Stewart's party he went out early.",m
4462,I called at his rooms to see him about something important that I thought he ought to know.,m
4463,"I missed him, and so left a note for him, which he got on his return and read.",m
4464,I found it open on his table later on.,m
4465,"At noon he went out again, and that's all.",m
4466,"Frankly, I'm worried about him.""",m
4467,"Miss Benham watched the man with thoughtful eyes and, when he had finished, she asked--  ""Could you tell me what was in this note that you left for Ste.",m
4468,"Marie?""",m
4469,"Hartley was by nature a very open and frank young man, and in consequence an unusually bad liar.",m
4470,He hesitated and looked away and he began to turn red.,m
4471,"""Well--no,"" he said after a moment, ""no, I'm afraid I can't.",m
4472,"It was something you wouldn't understand--wouldn't know about.""",m
4473,"And the girl said, ""Oh!"" and remained for a little while silent.",m
4474,"But at the end she looked up and met his eyes, and the man saw that she was very grave.",m
4475,"She said--  ""Richard, there is something that you and I have been avoiding and pretending not to see.",m
4476,"It has gone too far now, and we're got to face it with perfect frankness.",m
4477,I know what was in your note to Ste.,m
4478,Marie.,m
4479,"It was what you found out the other evening about--my uncle, the matter of the will and the other matter.",m
4480,"He knew about the will, but he told you and Ste.",m
4481,Marie that he didn't.,m
4482,He said to you also that I had told him about my engagement and Ste.,m
4483,"Marie's determination to search for Arthur, and that was--a lie.",m
4484,"I didn't tell him, and grandfather didn't tell him.",m
4485,He listened in the door yonder and heard it himself.,m
4486,I have a good reason for knowing that.,m
4487,"""And then,"" she said, ""he tried very hard to persuade you and Ste.",m
4488,"Marie to take up your search under his direction, and he partly succeeded.",m
4489,He sent Ste.,m
4490,"Marie upon a foolish expedition to Dinard, and he gave him and gave you other clues just as foolish as that one.",m
4491,"""Richard, do you believe that my uncle has hidden poor Arthur away somewhere, or--worse than that?",m
4492,Do you?,m
4493,"Tell me the truth!""",m
4494,"""There is not,"" said Hartley, ""one particle of real evidence against him that I'm aware of.",m
4495,"There's plenty of motive, if you like, but motive is not evidence.""",m
4496,"""I asked you a question,"" the girl said.",m
4497,"""Do you believe my uncle has been responsible for Arthur's disappearance?""",m
4498,"""Yes,"" said Richard Hartley, ""I'm afraid I do.""",m
4499,"""Then,"" she said, ""he has been responsible for Ste.",m
4500,Marie's disappearance also.,m
4501,Ste.,m
4502,Marie became dangerous to him and so vanished.,m
4503,"What can we do, Richard?",m
4504,"What can we do?""                                                               In the upper chamber at La Lierre the days dragged very slowly by, and the man who lay in bed there counted interminable hours, and prayed for the coming of night with its merciful oblivion of sleep.",m
4505,"His inaction was made bitterer by the fact that the days were days of green and gold, of breeze-stirred tree-tops without his windows, of vagrant sweet airs that stole in upon his solitude, bringing him all the warm fragrance of summer and of green things growing.",m
4506,He suffered little pain.,m
4507,"There was, for the first three or four days, a dull and feverish ache in his wounded leg, but presently even that passed and the leg hurt him only when he moved it.",m
4508,He thought sometimes that he would be grateful for a bit of physical anguish to make the hours pass more quickly.,m
4509,The other inmates of the house held aloof from him.,m
4510,"Once a day O'Hara came in to see to the wound, but he maintained a well-nigh complete silence over his work and answered questions only with a brief yes or no.  Sometimes he did not answer them at all.",m
4511,"The old Michel came twice daily, but this strange being had quite plainly been frightened into dumbness, and there was nothing to be got out of him.",m
4512,"He shambled hastily about the place, his one scared eye upon the man in bed, and as soon as possible fled away, closing the door behind him.",m
4513,"Sometimes Michel brought in the meals, sometimes his wife, a creature so like him that the two might well have passed for twin survivors of some unknown race; sometimes--thrice altogether in that first week--Coira O'Hara brought the tray, and she was as silent as the others.",m
4514,So Ste.,m
4515,"Marie was left alone to get through the interminable days as best he might, and ever afterwards the week remained in his memory as a sort of nightmare.",m
4516,"Lying idle in his bed he evolved many surprising and fantastic schemes for escape--for getting word to the outside world of his presence here, and one by one he gave them up in disgust as their impossibility forced itself upon him.",m
4517,"Plans and schemes were useless while he lay bed-ridden, unfamiliar even with the house wherein he dwelt, with the garden and park that surrounded it.",m
4518,"As for aid from any of the inmates of the place, that was to be laughed at.",m
4519,They were engaged together in a scheme so desperate that failure must mean utter ruin to them all.,m
4520,He sometimes wondered if the two servants could be bribed.,m
4521,"Avarice unmistakable gleamed from their little glittering rat-like eyes, but he was sure that they would sell out for no small sum and, in so far as he could remember, there had been in his pockets when he came here not more than five or six louis.",m
4522,"Doubtless the old Michel had managed to abstract those in his daily offices about the room, for Ste.",m
4523,Marie knew that the clothes hung in a closet across from his bed.,m
4524,He had seen them there once when the closet door was open.,m
4525,Any help that might come to him must come from outside--and what help was to be expected there?,m
4526,Over and over again he reminded himself of how little Richard Hartley knew.,m
4527,"He might suspect Stewart of complicity in this new disappearance, but how was he to find out anything definite?",m
4528,How was any one to do so?,m
4529,"It was at such times as this, when brain and nerves were strained and worn almost to breaking point that Ste.",m
4530,"Marie had occasion to be grateful for the southern blood that was in him, the strong tinge of fatalism which is common alike to Latin and to Oriental.",m
4531,"It rescued him more than once from something like nervous breakdown, calmed him suddenly, lifted his burdens from outwearied shoulders, and left him in peace to wait until some action should be possible.",m
4532,"Then, in such hours, he would fall to thinking of the girl for whose sake, in whose cause, he lay bedridden, beset with dangers.",m
4533,"As long before, she came to him in a sort of waking vision--a being but half earthly, enthroned high above him, calm-browed, very pure, with passionless eyes that gazed into far distance and were unaware of the base things below.",m
4534,"What would she think of him, who had sworn to be true knight to her, if she could know how he had bungled and failed?",m
4535,"He was glad that she did not know, that if he had blundered into peril the knowledge of it could not reach her to hurt her pride.",m
4536,"And sometimes also, with a great sadness and pity, he thought of poor Coira O'Hara and of the pathetic wreck her life had fallen into.",m
4537,The girl was so patently fit for better things!,m
4538,Her splendid beauty was not a cheap beauty.,m
4539,"She was no coarse-blown gorgeous flower, imperfect at telltale points.",m
4540,"It was good blood that had modelled her dark perfection, good blood that had shaped her long and slim and tapering hands.",m
4541,"""A queen among goddesses!""",m
4542,The words remained with him and he knew that they were true.,m
4543,"She might have held up her head among the greatest, this adventurer's girl; but what chance had she had?",m
4544,What merest ghost of a chance?,m
4545,He watched her on the rare occasions when she came into the room.,m
4546,"He watched the poise of her head, her walk, the movements she made, and he said to himself that there was no woman of his acquaintance whose grace was more perfect--certainly none whose grace was so native.",m
4547,"Once he complained to her of the desperate idleness of his days and asked her to lend him a book of some kind, a review, even a daily newspaper, though it be a week old.",m
4548,"""I should read the very advertisements with joy,"" he said.",m
4549,"She went out of the room and returned presently with an armful of books, which she laid upon the bed without comment.",m
4550,"""In my prayers, mademoiselle,"" cried Ste.",m
4551,"Marie, ""you shall be foremost forever!""",m
4552,He glanced at the row of titles and looked up in sheer astonishment.,m
4553,"""May I ask whose books these are?"" he said.",m
4554,"""They are mine,"" said the girl.",m
4555,"""I caught up the ones that lay first at hand.",m
4556,"If you don't care for any of them I will choose others.""",m
4557,"The books were: Diana of the Crossways, Richard Feverel, Henri Lavedan's Le Duel, Maeterlinck's Pelleas et Melisande, Don Quixote de la Mancha, in Spanish, a volume of Virgil's Eclogues, and the Life of the Chevalier Bayard by the ""Loyal Servitor.""",m
4558,Ste.,m
4559,Marie stared at her.,m
4560,"""Do you read Spanish?"" he demanded, ""and Latin, as well as French and English?""",m
4561,"""My mother was Spanish,"" said she.",m
4562,"""And as for Latin, I began to read it with my father when I was a child.",m
4563,"Shall I leave the books here?""",m
4564,Ste.,m
4565,Marie took up the Bayard and held it between his hands.,m
4566,"""It is worn from much reading, mademoiselle,"" he said.",m
4567,"""It is the best of all,"" said she.",m
4568,"""The very best of all.",m
4569,"I didn't know I had brought you that.""",m
4570,"She made a step towards him as if she would take the book away, and over it the eyes of them met and were held.",m
4571,"In that moment it may have come to them both who she was, who so loved the knight without fear and without reproach--the daughter of an Irish adventurer of ill repute; for their faces began suddenly to flush with red and after an instant the girl turned away.",m
4572,"""It is of no consequence,"" said she.",m
4573,"""You may keep the book if you care to.""",m
4574,And Ste.,m
4575,"Marie said very gently--  ""Thank you, mademoiselle!",m
4576,"I will keep it for a little while.""",m
4577,So she went out of the room and left him alone.,m
4578,"This was at noon on the sixth day, and after he had swallowed hastily the lunch which had been set before him Ste.",m
4579,Marie fell upon the books like a child upon a new box of sweets.,m
4580,Like the child again it was difficult for him to choose among them.,m
4581,"He opened one and then another, gloating over them all, but in the end he chose the Bayard and for hours lost himself among the high deeds of the Preux Chevalier and his faithful friends (among whom, by the way, there was a Ste.",m
4582,Marie who died nobly for France).,m
4583,It was late afternoon when at last he laid the book down with a sigh and settled himself more comfortably among the pillows.,m
4584,"The sun was not in the room at that hour but, from where he lay, he could see it on the tree-tops, gold upon green.",m
4585,Outside his south window the leaves of a chestnut which stood there quivered and rustled gently under a soft breeze.,m
4586,Delectable odours floated in to Ste.,m
4587,"Marie's nostrils, and he thought how very pleasant it would be if he were lying on the turf under the trees, instead of bed-ridden in this upper chamber, which he had come to hate with a bitter hatred.",m
4588,"He began to wonder if it would be possible to drag himself across the floor to that south window, and so to lie down for a while with his head in the tiny balcony beyond--his eyes turned to the blue sky.",m
4589,Astir with the new thought he sat up in bed and carefully swung his feet out till they hung to the floor.,m
4590,"The wound in the left leg smarted and burnt, but not too severely, and with slow pains Ste.",m
4591,Marie stood up.,m
4592,He almost cried out when he discovered that it could be done quite easily.,m
4593,"He essayed to walk and he was a little weak, but by no means helpless.",m
4594,"He found that it gave him pain to raise his left leg in the ordinary action of walking, or to bend that knee, but he could get about well enough by dragging the injured member beside him, for when it was straight it supported him without protest.",m
4595,"He took his pillows across to the window and disposed them there, for it was a French window opening to the floor, and the level of the little balcony outside was but a few inches above the level of the room.",m
4596,Then the desire seized him to make a tour of his prison walls.,m
4597,"He went first to the closet where he had seen his clothes hanging, and they were still there.",m
4598,He felt in the pockets and withdrew his little English pig-skin sovereign purse.,m
4599,"It had not been tampered with, and he gave an exclamation of relief over that, for he might later on have use for money.",m
4600,"There were eight louis in it, each in its little separate compartment, and in another pocket he found a fifty-franc note and some silver.",m
4601,He went to the two east windows and looked out.,m
4602,"The trees stood thick together on that side of the house, but between two of them he could see the park wall fifty yards away.",m
4603,"He glanced down, and the side of the house was covered thick with the ivy which had given the place its name, but there was no water pipe near nor any other thing which seemed to offer foot or hand hold--unless perhaps the ivy might prove strong enough to bear a man's weight.",m
4604,Ste.,m
4605,"Marie made a mental note to look into that when he was a little stronger, and turned back to the south window, where he had disposed his pillows.",m
4606,"The unaccustomed activity was making his wound smart and prickle, and he lay down at once, with head and shoulders in the open air; and, out of the warm and golden sunshine and the emerald shade, the breath of summer came to him and wrapped him round with sweetness and pillowed him upon its fragrant breast.",m
4607,"He became aware, after a long time, of voices below, and turned upon his elbows to look.",m
4608,The ivy had clambered upon and partly covered the iron grille of the little balcony and he could observe without being seen.,m
4609,"Young Arthur Benham and Coira O'Hara had come out of the door of the house, and they stood upon the raised and paved terrace which ran the width of the facade, and seemed to hesitate as to the direction they should take.",m
4610,Ste.,m
4611,"Marie heard the girl say--  ""It's cooler here in the shade of the house,"" and, after a moment, the two came along the shady terrace, whose outer margin was set at intervals with stained and discoloured marble nymphs upon pedestals, and, between the nymphs, with moss-grown stone benches.",m
4612,"They halted before a bench upon which, earlier in the day, a rug had been spread out to dry in the sun and had been forgotten, and, after a moment's further hesitation, they sat down upon it.",m
4613,Their faces were turned towards the house and every word that they spoke mounted in that still air clear and distinct to the ears of the man above.,m
4614,Ste.,m
4615,Marie wriggled back into the room and sat up to consider.,m
4616,The thought of deliberately listening to a conversation not meant for him sent a hot flush to his cheeks.,m
4617,"He told himself that it could not be done, and that there was an end to the matter.",m
4618,Whatever might hang upon it it could not be asked of him that he should stoop to dishonour.,m
4619,But at that the heavy and grave responsibility which really did hang upon him and upon his actions came before his mind's eyes and loomed there mountainous.,m
4620,"The fate of this foolish boy, who was set round with thieves and adventurers--even though his eyes were open and he knew where he stood--that came to Ste.",m
4621,Marie and confronted him: and the picture of a bitter old man who was dying of grief came to him: and a mother's face: and hers.,m
4622,"There could be no dishonour in the face of all this, only a duty very clear and plain.",m
4623,"He crept back to his place, his arms folded beneath him as he lay, his eyes at the thin screen of ivy which cloaked the balcony grille.",m
4624,Young Arthur Benham appeared to be giving tongue to a rather sharp attack of homesickness.,m
4625,It may be that long confinement within the walls of La Lierre was beginning to try him somewhat.,m
4626,"""Mind you,"" he declared, as Ste.",m
4627,"Marie's ears came once more within range, ""mind you, I'm not saying that Paris hasn't got its points.",m
4628,It has.,m
4629,Oh yes!,m
4630,"And so has London, and so has Ostend, and so has Monte Carlo--Verree much so!--I like Paris.",m
4631,"I like the theatres and the vaudeville shows in the Champs Elysees, and I like Longchamps.",m
4632,I like the boys who hang around Henry's bar.,m
4633,"They're good sports, all right, all right!",m
4634,"But, by Golly, I want to go home!",m
4635,Put me off at the corner of Forty-second Street and Broadway and I'll ask no more.,m
4636,"Set me down at seven p.m. right there on the corner outside the Knickerbocker, for that's where I would live and die.""",m
4637,There came into the lad's somewhat strident voice a softness that was almost pathetic.,m
4638,"""You don't know Broadway, Coira, do you?",m
4639,Nix! of course not.,m
4640,"Little girl, it's the one, one street of all this large world.",m
4641,It's the equator that runs north and south instead of east and west.,m
4642,"It's a long bright gay live wire, that's what Broadway is.",m
4643,And I give you my word of honour like a little man that it--is--not--slow.,m
4644,No indeed!,m
4645,When I was there last it was being called the Gay White Way.,m
4646,It is not called the Gay White Way now.,m
4647,"It has had forty other new good names since then, and I don't know what they are, but I do know that it is forever gay, and that the electric signs are still blazing all along the street, and the street cars are still killing people in the good old fashion, and the newsboys are still dodging under the automobiles to sell you a Woild or a Choinal or, if it's after twelve at night, a Morning Telegraph.",m
4648,"Coira, my girl, standing on that corner after dark you can see the electric signs of fifteen theatres, no one of them more than five minutes' walk away, and just round the corner there are more.",m
4649,"""I want to go home!",m
4650,I want to take one large unparalleled leap from here and come down at the corner I told you about.,m
4651,D'you know what I'd do?,m
4652,We'll say it's seven p.m. and beginning to get dark.,m
4653,"I'd dive into the Knickerbocker (that's the hotel that the bright and happy people go to for dinner or supper), and I'd engage a table up on the terrace.",m
4654,"Then I'd telephone to a little friend of mine, whose name is Doe--John Doe--and in about ten minutes he'd have left the crowd he was standing in line with and he'd come galloping up that glad to see me you'd cry to watch him.",m
4655,"We'd go up on the terrace, where the potted palms grow, for our dinner, and the tables all around us would be full of people that would know Johnnie Doe and me, and they'd all make us drink drinks and tell us how glad they were to see us aboard again.",m
4656,"""And after dinner,"" said young Arthur Benham, with wide and smiling eyes, ""after dinner we'd go to see one of the Roof Garden shows.",m
4657,"Let me tell you they've got the Marigny, or the Ambassadeurs, or the Jardin de Paris beaten to a pulp--to--a--pulp!",m
4658,"And after the show we'd slip round to the stage door--you bet we would!--and capture the two most beautiful ladies in the world and take 'em off to supper.""",m
4659,He wrinkled his young brow in great perplexity.,m
4660,"""Now I wonder,"" said he anxiously.",m
4661,"""I wonder where we'd go for supper.",m
4662,"""You see,"" he apologised, ""it's two years since I left the Real Street, and Gee, what a lot can happen on Broadway in two years!",m
4663,"There's probably half a dozen new supper places that I don't know anything about, and one of them's the place where the crowd goes.",m
4664,"Well, anyhow, we'd go to that place, and there'd be a band playing, and the electric fans would go round, and round, and Johnnie Doe and I and the two most beautiful ladies would put it all over the other pikers there.""",m
4665,Young Benham gave a little sigh of pleasure and excitement.,m
4666,"""That's what I'd like to do to-night,"" said he, ""and that's what I'll do, you can bet your sh--boots, when all this silly mess is over and I'm a free man.",m
4667,"I'll hike back to good old Broadway, and if ever you see any one trying to pry me loose from it again, you can laugh yourself to death, because he'll never, never succeed.",m
4668,"""Nine more weeks shut in here by stonewalls!"" said the boy, staring about him with a sort of bitterness.",m
4669,"""Nine weeks more!""",m
4670,"""Is it so hard as that?"" asked the girl.",m
4671,There was no foolish coquetry in her tone.,m
4672,"She spoke as if the words involved no personal question at all, but there was a little smile at her lips, and Arthur Benham turned towards her quickly and caught at her hands.",m
4673,"""No, no!"" he cried.",m
4674,"""I didn't mean that.",m
4675,You know I didn't mean that.,m
4676,You're worth nine years' waiting.,m
4677,"You're the best, d'you hear? the best there is.",m
4678,There's nobody anywhere that can touch you.,m
4679,"Only--well, this place is getting on my nerves.",m
4680,It's got me worn to a frazzle.,m
4681,"I feel like a criminal doing time.""",m
4682,"""You came very near having to do time somewhere else,"" said the girl.",m
4683,"""If this M. Ste.",m
4684,"Marie hadn't blundered we should have had them all round our ears, and you'd have had to run for it.""",m
4685,"""Yes,"" the boy said, nodding gravely.",m
4686,"""Yes, that was great luck.""",m
4687,He raised his head and looked up along the windows above him.,m
4688,"""Which is his room?"" he asked, and Mlle.",m
4689,"O'Hara said--  ""The one just overhead, but he's in bed far back from the window.",m
4690,"He couldn't possibly hear us talking.""",m
4691,"She paused for a moment in frowning hesitation, and, in the end, said--  ""Tell me about him, this Ste.",m
4692,Marie!,m
4693,"Do you know anything about him?""",m
4694,"[Illustration: ""'Tell me about him, this Ste.",m
4695,Marie!,m
4696,"Do you know anything about him?'""]  ""No,"" said Arthur Benham, ""I don't--not personally, that is.",m
4697,Of course I've heard of him.,m
4698,Lots of people have spoken of him to me.,m
4699,And the odd part of it is that they all had a good word to say.,m
4700,Everybody seemed to like him.,m
4701,I got the idea that he was the best ever.,m
4702,I wanted to know him.,m
4703,"I never thought he'd take on a piece of dirty work like this.""",m
4704,"""Nor I!"" said the girl, in a low voice.",m
4705,"""Nor I!""",m
4706,The boy looked up.,m
4707,"""Oh, you've heard of him too, then?"" said he.",m
4708,"And she said, still in her low voice--  ""I--saw him once.""",m
4709,"""Well,"" declared young Benham, ""it's beyond me.",m
4710,I give it up.,m
4711,"You never can tell about people, can you?",m
4712,I guess they'll all go wrong when there's enough in it to make it worth while.,m
4713,That's what old Charlie always says.,m
4714,"He says most people are straight enough when there's nothing in it, but make the pot big enough and they'll all go crooked.""",m
4715,The young man's face turned suddenly hard and old and bitter.,m
4716,"""Gee!",m
4717,"I ought to know that well enough, oughtn't I?"" he said.",m
4718,"""I guess nobody knows that better than I do after what happened to me...",m
4719,"Come along and take a walk in the garden, Maud!",m
4720,"I'm sick of sitting still.""",m
4721,Mlle.,m
4722,"Coira O'Hara looked up with a start, as if she had not been listening, but she rose, when the boy held out his hand to her, and the two went down from the terrace and moved off towards the west.",m
4723,Ste.,m
4724,"Marie watched them until they had disappeared among the trees, and then turned on his back, staring up into the softly stirring canopy of green above him, and the little rifts of bright blue sky.",m
4725,He did not understand at all.,m
4726,Something mysterious had crept in where all had seemed so plain to the eye.,m
4727,Certain words that young Arthur Benham had spoken repeated themselves in his mind and he could not at once make them out.,m
4728,Assuredly there was something mysterious here.,m
4729,"In the first place what did the boy mean by ""dirty work""?",m
4730,"To be sure spying in its usual sense is not held to be one of the noblest of occupations, but--in such a cause as this!",m
4731,"It was absurd, ridiculous, to call it ""dirty work.""",m
4732,And what did he mean by the words which he had used afterwards?,m
4733,Ste.,m
4734,"Marie did not quite follow the idiom about the ""big enough pot,"" but he assumed that it referred to money.",m
4735,Did the young fool think he was being paid for his efforts?,m
4736,That was ridiculous too.,m
4737,The boy's face came before him as it had looked with that sudden hard and bitter expression.,m
4738,What did he mean by saying that no one knew the crookedness of humanity under money temptation better than he knew it after something that had happened to him?,m
4739,In a sense his words were doubtless very true.,m
4740,"Captain Stewart (and he must have been ""old Charlie""--Ste.",m
4741,"Marie remembered that the name was Charles), O'Hara and O'Hara's daughter stood excellent samples of that bit of cynicism, but obviously the boy had not spoken in that sense--certainly not before Mlle.",m
4742,O'Hara!,m
4743,"He meant something else, then.",m
4744,But what?,m
4745,What?,m
4746,Ste.,m
4747,"Marie rose with some difficulty to his feet, and carried the pillows back to the bed whence he had taken them.",m
4748,"He sat down upon the edge of the bed, staring in great perplexity across the room at the open window, but all at once he uttered an exclamation, and he smote his hands together.",m
4749,"""That boy doesn't know!"" he cried.",m
4750,"""They're tricking him, these others!""",m
4751,"The lad's face came once more before him, and it was a foolish and stubborn face perhaps, but it was neither vicious nor mean.",m
4752,"It was the face of an honest headstrong boy, who would be incapable of the cold cruelty to which all circumstances seemed to point.",m
4753,"""They're tricking him somehow!"" cried Ste.",m
4754,Marie again.,m
4755,"""They're lying to him and making him think----""  What was it they were making him think, these three conspirators?",m
4756,What possible thing could they make him think other than the plain truth?,m
4757,Ste.,m
4758,Marie shook a weary head and lay down among his pillows.,m
4759,"He wished that he had ""old Charlie"" in a corner of that room with his fingers round ""old Charlie's"" wicked throat.",m
4760,"He would soon get at the truth then: or O'Hara either, that grim and saturnine chevalier d'industrie, though O'Hara would be a bad handful to manage: or--Ste.",m
4761,"Marie's head dropped back with a little groan when the face of young Arthur's enchantress came between him and the opposite wall of the room, and her great and tragic eyes looked into his.",m
4762,"It seemed incredible that that queen among goddesses should be what she was!                                                             When O'Hara, the next morning, went through the formality of looking in upon his patient, and after a taciturn nod was about to go away again, Ste.",m
4763,Marie called him back.,m
4764,"He said--  ""Would you mind waiting a moment?"" and the Irishman halted inside the door.",m
4765,"""I made an experiment yesterday,"" said Ste.",m
4766,"Marie, ""and I find that, after a poor fashion, I can walk--that is to say, I can drag myself about a little, without any great pain, if I don't bend the left leg.""",m
4767,"O'Hara returned to the bed and made a silent examination of the bullet wound which, it was plain to see, was doing very well indeed.",m
4768,"""You'll be all right in a few days,"" said he, ""but you'll be lame for a week yet--maybe two.",m
4769,"As a matter of fact, I've known men to march half a day with a hole in the leg worse than yours, though it probably was not quite pleasant.""",m
4770,"""I'm afraid I couldn't march very far,"" said Ste.",m
4771,"Marie, ""but I can hobble a bit.",m
4772,"The point is, I'm going mad from confinement in this room.",m
4773,"Do you think I might be allowed to stagger about the garden for an hour, or sit there under one of the trees?",m
4774,"I don't like to ask favours, but--so far as I can see it could do no harm.",m
4775,"I couldn't possibly escape, you see.",m
4776,"I couldn't climb a fifteen foot wall even if I had two good legs: as it is, with a leg and a half, I couldn't climb anything.""",m
4777,"The Irishman looked at him sharply, and was silent for a time as if considering.",m
4778,"But at last he said--  ""Of course there is no reason whatever for granting you any favours here.",m
4779,"You're on the footing of a spy--a captured spy, and you're very lucky not to have got what you deserved instead of a trumpery flesh wound.""",m
4780,The man's face twisted into a heavy scowl.,m
4781,"""Unfortunately,"" said he, ""an--accident has put me--put us in as unpleasant a position towards you as you had put yourself towards us.",m
4782,"We seem to stand in the position of having tried to poison you, and--well, we owe you something for that.",m
4783,"Still, I'd meant to keep you locked up in this room so long as it was necessary to have you at La Lierre.""",m
4784,He scowled once more in an intimidating fashion at Ste.,m
4785,"Marie, and it was evident that he found himself embarrassed.",m
4786,"""And,"" he said awkwardly, ""I suppose I owe something to your father's son....",m
4787,Look here! if you're to be allowed in the garden you must understand that it's at fixed hours and not alone.,m
4788,"Somebody will always be with you, and old Michel will be on hand to shoot you down if you try to run for it, or if you try to communicate with Arthur Benham.",m
4789,"Is that understood?""",m
4790,"""Quite!"" said Ste.",m
4791,Marie gaily.,m
4792,"""Quite understood and agreed to.",m
4793,And many thanks for your courtesy.,m
4794,I shan't forget it.,m
4795,"We differ rather widely on some rather important subjects, you and I, but I must confess that you're very generous, and I thank you.",m
4796,"The old Michel has my full permission to shoot at me if he sees me trying to fly over a fifteen foot wall.""",m
4797,"""He'll shoot without asking your permission,"" said the Irishman grimly, ""if you try that on, but I don't think you'll be apt to try it for the present--not with a crippled leg.""",m
4798,He pulled out his watch and looked at it.,m
4799,"""Nine o'clock,"" said he.",m
4800,"""If you care to begin to-day you can go out at eleven for an hour.",m
4801,"I'll see that old Michel is ready at that time.""",m
4802,"""Eleven will suit me perfectly,"" said Ste.",m
4803,Marie.,m
4804,"""You're very good.",m
4805,"Thanks once more!""",m
4806,The Irishman did not seem to hear.,m
4807,He replaced the watch in his pocket and turned away in silence.,m
4808,"But before he left the room he stood a moment beside one of the windows, staring out into the morning sunshine, and the other man could see that his face had once more settled into the still and melancholic gloom which was characteristic of it.",m
4809,Ste.,m
4810,"Marie watched and, for the first time, the man began to interest him as a human being.",m
4811,"He had thought of O'Hara before merely as a rather shady adventurer of a not very rare type, but he looked at the adventurer's face now, and he saw that it was the face of a man of unspeakable sorrows.",m
4812,"When O'Hara looked at one, one saw only a pair of singularly keen and hard blue eyes set under a bony brow.",m
4813,"When those eyes were turned away, the man's attention relaxed, the face became a battleground furrowed and scarred with wrecked pride and with bitterness and with shame and with agony.",m
4814,"Most soldiers of fortune have faces like that, for the world has used them very ill, and they have lost one precious thing after another until all are gone; and they have tasted everything that there is in life, and the flavour which remains is a very bitter flavour--dry like ashes.",m
4815,It came to Ste.,m
4816,"Marie, as he lay watching this man, that the story of the man's life, if he could be made to tell it would doubtless be one of the most interesting stories in the world, as must be the tale of the adventurous career of any one who has slipped down the ladder of respectability rung by rung into that shadowy no-man's-land, where the furtive birds of prey foregather and hatch their plots.",m
4817,"It was plain enough that O'Hara had, as the phrase goes, seen better days.",m
4818,"Without question he was a villain, but after all a generous villain.",m
4819,He had been very decent about making amends for that poisoning affair.,m
4820,A cheaper rascal would have behaved otherwise.,m
4821,Ste.,m
4822,Marie suddenly remembered what a friend of his had once said of this mysterious Irishman.,m
4823,"The two had been sitting on the terrace of a cafe, and, as O'Hara passed by, Ste.",m
4824,"Marie's friend pointed after him and said: ""There goes some of the best blood that ever came out of Ireland.",m
4825,"See what it has fallen to!""",m
4826,Seemingly it had fallen pretty low.,m
4827,"He would have liked very much to know about the downward stages, but he knew that he would never hear anything of them from the man himself, for O'Hara was clad, as it were, in an armour of taciturnity.",m
4828,He was incredibly silent.,m
4829,He wore mail that nothing could pierce.,m
4830,"The Irishman turned abruptly away and left the room, and Ste.",m
4831,"Marie, with all the gay excitement of a little girl preparing for her first nursery party, began to get himself ready to go out.",m
4832,"The old Michel had already been there to help him bathe and shave, so that he had only to dress himself and attend to his one conspicuous vanity--the painstaking arrangement of his hair, which he wore, according to the fashion of the day, parted a little at one side and brushed almost straight back, so that it looked rather like a close-fitting and incredibly glossy skull-cap.",m
4833,"Richard Hartley, who was inclined to joke at his friend's grave interest in the matter, said that it reminded him of patent leather.",m
4834,When he was dressed--and he found that putting on his left boot was no mean feat--Ste.,m
4835,Marie sat down in a chair by the window and lighted a cigarette.,m
4836,"He had half an hour to wait, and so he picked up the volume of Bayard, which Coira O'Hara had not yet taken away from him, and began to read in it at random.",m
4837,"He became so absorbed that the old Michel, come to summon him, took him by surprise.",m
4838,But it was a pleasant surprise and very welcome.,m
4839,He followed the old man out of the room with a heart that beat fast with eagerness.,m
4840,"The descent of the stairs offered difficulties, for the wounded leg protested sharply against being bent more than a very little at the knee.",m
4841,"But, by aid of Michel's shoulder, he made the passage in safety, and so came to the lower story.",m
4842,"At the foot of the stairs some one opened a door almost in their faces, but closed it again with great haste, and Ste.",m
4843,"Marie gave a chuckle of laughter, for, though it was almost dark there, he thought he had recognised Captain Stewart.",m
4844,"""So old Charlie's with us to-day, is he?"" he said aloud, and Michel queried: ""Comment, monsieur?"" because Ste.",m
4845,Marie had spoken in English.,m
4846,"They came out upon the terrace before the house, and the fresh sweet air bore against their faces, and little flecks of live gold danced and shivered about their feet upon the moss-stained tiles.",m
4847,"The gardener stepped back for an instant into the doorway and reappeared, bearing across his arms the short carbine with which Ste.",m
4848,Marie had already made acquaintance.,m
4849,"The victim looked at this weapon with a laugh, and the old Michel's gnome-like countenance distorted itself suddenly and a weird cackle came from it.",m
4850,"""It is my old friend?"" demanded Ste.",m
4851,"Marie, and the gardener cackled once more, stroking the barrel of the weapon as if it were a faithful dog.",m
4852,"""The same, monsieur,"" said he.",m
4853,"""But she apologises for not doing better.""",m
4854,"""Beg her for me,"" said the young man, ""to cheer up.",m
4855,"She may get another chance.""",m
4856,"Old Michel's face froze into an expression of anxious and rather frightened solicitude, but he waved his arm for the prisoner to precede him, and Ste.",m
4857,Marie began to limp down across the littered and unkempt sweep of turf.,m
4858,"Behind him at the distance of a dozen paces he heard the shambling footfalls of his guard, but he had expected that, and it could not rob him of his swelling and exultant joy at treading once more upon green grass and looking up into blue sky.",m
4859,"He was like a man newly released from a dungeon, rather than from a sunny and by no means uncomfortable upper chamber.",m
4860,"He would have liked to dance and sing, to run at full speed like a child until he was breathless and red in the face.",m
4861,"Instead of that he had to drag himself with slow pains and some discomfort, but his spirit ran ahead, dancing and singing, and he thought that it even halted now and then to roll on the grass.",m
4862,"As he had observed, a week before from the top of his wall, a double row of larches led straight down away from the front of the house, making a wide and long vista interrupted, halfway to its end, by a rond point, in the centre of which was a pool and a fountain.",m
4863,"The double row of trees was sadly broken now, and the trees were untrimmed and uncared for.",m
4864,"One of them had fallen, probably in a wind storm, and lay dead across the way.",m
4865,Ste.,m
4866,"Marie turned aside towards the west and found himself presently among chestnuts, planted in close rows, whose tops grew in so thick a canopy above that but little sunshine came through, and there was no turf under foot, only black earth hard trodden, mossy here and there.",m
4867,"From beyond, in the direction he had chanced to take and a little towards the west, a soft morning breeze bore to him the scent of roses, so constant and so sweet despite its delicacy that to breathe it was like an intoxication.",m
4868,"He felt it begin to take hold upon and to sway his senses like an exquisite, an insidious wine.",m
4869,"""The flower gardens, Michel?"" he asked over his shoulder.",m
4870,"""They are before us?""",m
4871,"""Ahead and to the left, monsieur,"" said the old man, and he took up once more his slow and difficult progress.",m
4872,"But again, before he had gone many steps, he was halted.",m
4873,"There began to reach his ears a rich but slender strain of sound, a golden thread of melody.",m
4874,"At first he thought that it was a cello or the lower notes of a violin, but presently he became aware that it was a woman singing in a half-voice without thought of what she sang--as women croon to a child, or over their work, or when they are idle and their thoughts are far wandering.",m
4875,"The mistake was not as absurd as it may seem, for it is a fact that the voice which is called a contralto, if it is a good and clear and fairly resonant voice, sounds at a distance very much indeed like a cello or the lower register of a violin.",m
4876,And that is especially true when the voice is hushed to a half-articulate murmur.,m
4877,"Indeed, this is but one of the many strange peculiarities of that most beautiful of all human organs.",m
4878,"The contralto can rarely express the lighter things, and it is quite impossible for it to express merriment or gaiety, but it can thrill the heart as can no other sound emitted by a human throat, and it can shake the soul to its very innermost hidden deeps.",m
4879,It is the soft yellow gold of singing--the wine of sound: it is mystery: it is shadowy unknown beautiful places: it is enchantment.,m
4880,Ste.,m
4881,Marie stood still and listened.,m
4882,The sound of low singing came from the right.,m
4883,"Without realising that he had moved he began to make his way in that direction, and the old Michel, carbine upon arm, followed behind him.",m
4884,He had no doubt of the singer.,m
4885,"He knew well who it was, for the girl's speaking voice had thrilled him long before this.",m
4886,"He came to the eastern margin of the grove of chestnuts, and found that he was beside the open rond point where the pool lay within its stone circumference, unclean and choked with lily pads, and the fountain, a naked lady holding aloft a shell, stood above.",m
4887,"The rond point was not in reality round, it was an oval with its greater axis at right angles to the long straight avenue of larches.",m
4888,"At the two ends of the oval there were stone benches with backs, and behind these tall shrubs grew close and overhung so that even at noonday the spots were shaded.                                                          Mlle.",m
4889,Coira O'Hara sat alone upon the stone bench at the hither end of the rond point.,m
4890,"With a leisurely hand she put fine stitches into a mysterious garment of white, with lace on it, and, over her not too arduous toil, she sang a demi voix, a little German song all about the tender passions.",m
4891,Ste.,m
4892,"Marie halted his dragging steps a little way off, but the girl heard him and turned to look.",m
4893,"After that she rose hurriedly and stood as if poised for flight, but Ste.",m
4894,Marie took his hat in his hands and came forward.,m
4895,"""If you go away, mademoiselle,"" said he;",m
4896,"""if you let me drive you from your place, I shall limp across to that pool and fall in and drown myself, or I shall try to climb the wall yonder and Michel will have to shoot me.""",m
4897,He came forward another step.,m
4898,"""If it is impossible,"" he said, ""that you and I should stay here together for a few little moments, and talk about what a beautiful day it is--if that is impossible, why then I must apologise for intruding upon you and go on my way, inexorably pursued by the would-be murderer who now stands six paces to the rear.",m
4899,"""Is it impossible, mademoiselle?"" said Ste.",m
4900,Marie.,m
4901,The girl's face was flushed with that deep and splendid understain.,m
4902,"She looked down upon the white garment in her hand and away across the broad rond point, and, in the end, she looked up very gravely into the face of the man who stood leaning upon his stick before her.",m
4903,"""I don't know,"" she said in her deep voice, ""what my father would wish.",m
4904,"I did not know that you were coming into the garden this morning or----""  ""Or else,"" said Ste.",m
4905,"Marie with a little touch of bitterness in his tone, ""or else you would not have been here.",m
4906,"You would have remained in the house.""",m
4907,He made a bow.,m
4908,"""To-morrow, mademoiselle,"" said he, ""and for the remainder of the days that I may be at La Lierre, I shall stay in my room.",m
4909,"You need have no fear of me.""",m
4910,All the man's life he had been spoilt.,m
4911,"The girl's bearing hurt him absurdly, and a little of the hurt may have betrayed itself in his face as he turned away, for she came towards him with a swift movement, saying--  ""No! no!",m
4912,Wait!,m
4913,"""I have hurt you,"" she said with a sort of wondering distress.",m
4914,"""You have let me hurt you....",m
4915,And yet surely you must see ... you must realise on what terms ...,m
4916,Do you forget that you are not among your friends ... outside? ...,m
4917,"This is so very different!""",m
4918,"""I had forgotten,"" said he.",m
4919,"""Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten.",m
4920,Will you grant me your pardon for that?,m
4921,"""And yet,"" he persisted after a moment's pause, ""yet, mademoiselle, consider a little!",m
4922,"It is likely that--circumstances have so fallen that it seems I shall be here within your walls for a time, perhaps a long time.",m
4923,I am able to walk a little now.,m
4924,"Day by day I shall be stronger, better able to get about.",m
4925,Is there not some way--are there not some terms under which we could meet without embarrassment?,m
4926,"Must we for ever glare at each other and pass by warily, just because we--well, hold different views about--something?""",m
4927,It was not a premeditated speech at all.,m
4928,It had never until this moment occurred to him to suggest any such arrangement with any member of the household at La Lierre.,m
4929,At another time he would doubtless have considered it undignified if not downright unwise to hold intercourse of any friendly sort with this band of contemptible adventurers.,m
4930,"The sudden impulse may have been born of his long week of almost intolerable loneliness, or it may have come of the warm exhilaration of this first breath of sweet outdoor air, or perhaps it needed neither of these things, for the girl was very beautiful--enchantment breathed from her, and though he knew what she was, in what despicable plot she was engaged, he was too much Ste.",m
4931,Marie to be quite indifferent to her.,m
4932,"Though he looked upon her sorrowfully and with pain and vicarious shame, he could not have denied the spell she wielded.",m
4933,After all he was Ste.,m
4934,Marie.,m
4935,Once more the girl looked up very gravely under her brows and her eyes met the man's eyes.,m
4936,"""I don't know,"" she said.",m
4937,"""Truly I don't know.",m
4938,I think I should have to ask my father about it.,m
4939,"""I wish,"" she said, ""that we might do that.",m
4940,I should like it.,m
4941,I should like to be able to talk to some one--about the things I like--and care for.,m
4942,I used to talk with my father about things.,m
4943,But not lately.,m
4944,"There is no one now.""",m
4945,Her eyes searched him.,m
4946,"""Would it be possible, I wonder,"" said she.",m
4947,"""Could we two put everything else aside--forget altogether who we are and why we are here.",m
4948,"Is that possible?""",m
4949,"""We could only try, mademoiselle,"" said Ste.",m
4950,Marie.,m
4951,"""If we found it a failure we could give it up.""",m
4952,He broke into a little laugh.,m
4953,"""And besides,"" he said, ""I can't help thinking that two people ought to be with me all the time I am in the garden here--for safety's sake.",m
4954,"I might catch the old Michel napping one day, you know, throttle him, take his rifle away and escape.",m
4955,"If there were two I couldn't do that.""",m
4956,"For an instant she met his laugh with an answering smile, and the smile came upon her sombre beauty like a moment of golden light upon darkness.",m
4957,But afterwards she was grave again and thoughtful.,m
4958,"""Is it not rather foolish,"" she asked, ""to warn us--to warn me of possibilities like that?",m
4959,You might quite easily do what you have said.,m
4960,"You are putting us on our guard against you.""",m
4961,"""I meant to, mademoiselle,"" said Ste.",m
4962,Marie.,m
4963,"""I meant to.",m
4964,Consider my reasons.,m
4965,"Consider what I was pleading for!""",m
4966,And he gave a little laugh when the colour began again to rise in the girl's cheeks.,m
4967,"She turned away from him, shaking her head, and he thought that he had said too much and that she was offended, but after a moment the girl looked up and, when she met his eyes, she laughed outright.",m
4968,"""I cannot for ever be scowling and snarling at you,"" said she.",m
4969,"""It is quite too absurd.",m
4970,Will you sit down for a little while?,m
4971,"I don't know whether or not my father would approve, but we have met here by accident, and there can be no harm surely in our exchanging a few civil words.",m
4972,If you try to bring up forbidden topics I can simply go away--and besides Michel stands ready to murder you if it should become necessary.,m
4973,"I think his failure of a week ago is very heavy on his conscience.""",m
4974,Ste.,m
4975,"Marie sat down in one corner of the long stone bench, and he was very glad to do it, for his leg was beginning to cause him some discomfort.",m
4976,"It felt hot, and as if there were a very tight band round it above the knee.",m
4977,"The relief must have been apparent in his face, for Mlle.",m
4978,"O'Hara looked at him in silence for a moment, and she gave a little troubled anxious frown.",m
4979,"Men can be quite indifferent to suffering in each other if the suffering is not extreme, and women can be too; but men are quite miserable in the presence of a woman who is in pain, and women, before a suffering man, while they are not miserable are always full of a desire to do something that will help.",m
4980,And that might be a small additional proof (if any more proof were necessary) that they are much the more practical of the two sexes.,m
4981,The girl's sharp glance seemed to assure her that Ste.,m
4982,"Marie was comfortable, now that he was sitting down, for the frown went from her brows, and she began to arrange the mysterious white garment in her lap in preparation to go on with her work.",m
4983,Ste.,m
4984,Marie watched her for awhile in a contented silence.,m
4985,"The leaves overhead stirred under a puff of air, and a single yellow beam of sunlight came down and shivered upon the girl's dark head and played about the bundle of white over which her hands were busy.",m
4986,"She moved aside to avoid it, but it followed her, and when she moved back it followed again and danced in her lap, as if it were a live thing with a malicious sense of humour.",m
4987,"It might have been Tinker Bell out of Peter Pan, only it did not jingle.",m
4988,Mlle.,m
4989,"O'Hara uttered an exclamation of annoyance, and Ste.",m
4990,"Marie laughed at her, but in a moment the leaves overhead were still again, and the sunbeam with a sense of humour was gone to torment some one else.",m
4991,"Still, neither of the two spoke, and Ste.",m
4992,Marie continued to watch the girl bent above her sewing.,m
4993,He was thinking of what she had said to him when he asked her if she read Spanish--that her mother had been Spanish.,m
4994,That would account then for her dark eyes.,m
4995,"It would account for the darkness of her skin too, but not for its extraordinary clearness and delicacy, for Spanish women are apt to have dull skins of an opaque texture.",m
4996,"This was, he said to himself, an Irish skin with a darker stain, and he was quite sure that he had never before seen anything at all like it.",m
4997,"Apart from colouring she was all Irish, of the type which has become famous the world over, and which in the opinion of men who have seen women in all countries, and have studied them, is the most beautiful type that exists in our time.",m
4998,Ste.,m
4999,"Marie was dark himself and, in the ordinary nature of things, he should have preferred a fair type in women.",m
5000,"In theory, for that matter, he did prefer it; but it was impossible for him to sit near Coira O'Hara, and watch her bent head and busy hovering hands and remain unstirred by her splendid beauty.",m
5001,"He found himself wondering why one kind of loveliness more than another should exert a potent and mysterious spell by virtue of mere proximity, and when the woman who bore it was entirely passive.",m
5002,"If this girl had been looking at him the matter would have been easy to understand, for an eye-glance is often downright hypnotic, but she was looking at the work in her hands and, so far as could be judged, she had altogether forgotten his presence; yet the mysterious spell, the potent enchantment, breathed from her like a vapour, and he could not be insensible to it.",m
5003,It was like sorcery.,m
5004,The girl looked up so suddenly that Ste.,m
5005,Marie jumped.,m
5006,"She said--  ""You are not a very talkative person.",m
5007,"Are you always as silent as this?""",m
5008,"""No,"" said he, ""I am not.",m
5009,I offer my humblest apologies.,m
5010,"It seems as if I were not being properly grateful for being allowed to sit here with you, but to tell the truth I was buried in thought.""",m
5011,"They had begun to talk in French, but, midway of Ste.",m
5012,"Marie's speech, the girl glanced towards the old Michel, who stood a short distance away, and so he changed to English.",m
5013,"""In that case,"" she said, regarding her work with her head on one side like a bird--""in that case you might at least tell me what your thoughts were.",m
5014,"They might be interesting.""",m
5015,Ste.,m
5016,Marie gave a little embarrassed laugh.,m
5017,"""I'm sorry,"" said he, ""but I'm afraid they were too personal.",m
5018,"I'm afraid if I told you, you'd get up and go away, and be frigidly polite to me when next we passed each other in the garden here.",m
5019,"""But there's no harm,"" he said, ""in telling you one thing that occurred to me.",m
5020,"It occurred to me that, as far as a young girl can be said to resemble an elderly woman, you bear a most remarkable resemblance to a very dear old friend of mine who lives near Dublin--Lady Margaret Craith.",m
5021,"She's a widow and almost all of her family are dead, I believe (I didn't know any of them), and she lives there in a huge old house with a park, quite alone, with her army of servants.",m
5022,"I go to see her whenever I'm in Ireland, because she is one of the sweetest souls I have ever known.""",m
5023,He became aware suddenly that Mlle.,m
5024,"O'Hara's head was bent very low over her sewing, and that her face, or as much of it as he could see, was crimson.",m
5025,"""Oh I--I beg your pardon!"" cried Ste.",m
5026,Marie.,m
5027,"""I've done something dreadful.",m
5028,"I don't know what it is, but I'm very, very sorry.",m
5029,"Please forgive me if you can!""",m
5030,"""It is nothing,"" she said in a low voice, and after a moment she looked up for the swiftest possible glance and down again.",m
5031,"""That is my--aunt,"" she said.",m
5032,"""Only--please, let us talk about something else!",m
5033,"Of course you couldn't possibly have known.""",m
5034,"""No,"" said Ste.",m
5035,Marie gravely.,m
5036,"""No, of course.",m
5037,"You are very good to forgive me.""",m
5038,"He was silent a little while, for what the girl had told him surprised him very much indeed, and touched him too.",m
5039,"He remembered again the remark of his friend when O'Hara had passed them on the boulevard--  ""There goes some of the best blood that ever came out of Ireland.",m
5040,"See what it has fallen to!""",m
5041,"""It is a curious fact,"" said he, ""that you and I are very close compatriots in the matter of blood--if 'compatriots' is the word.",m
5042,You are Irish and Spanish.,m
5043,"My mother was Irish and my people were Bearnais, which is about as much Spanish as French--and indeed there was a great deal of blood from across the mountains in them, for they often married Spanish wives.""",m
5044,He pulled the Bayard out of his pocket.,m
5045,"""The Ste.",m
5046,"Marie in here married a Spanish lady, didn't he?""",m
5047,The girl looked up to him once more.,m
5048,"""Yes,"" she said.",m
5049,"""Yes, I remember.",m
5050,"He was a brave man, monsieur.",m
5051,He had a great soul.,m
5052,"And he died nobly.""",m
5053,"""Well, as for that,"" he said, flushing a little, ""the Ste.",m
5054,"Maries have all died rather well.""",m
5055,He gave a short laugh.,m
5056,"""Though I must admit,"" said he, ""that the last of them came precious near falling below the family standard a week ago.",m
5057,I should think that probably none of my respected forefathers was killed in climbing over a garden wall.,m
5058,"Autres temps autres moeurs.""",m
5059,"He burst out laughing again at what seemed to him rather comic, but Mlle.",m
5060,O'Hara did not smile.,m
5061,She looked very gravely into his eyes and there seemed to be something like sorrow in her look.,m
5062,Ste.,m
5063,"Marie wondered at it, but after a moment it occurred to him that he was very near forbidden ground, and that doubtless the girl was trying to give him a silent warning of it.",m
5064,He began to turn over the leaves of the book in his hand.,m
5065,"""You have marked a great many pages here,"" said he, and she said--  ""It is my best of all books.",m
5066,I read in it very often.,m
5067,I am so thankful for it that there are no words to say how thankful I am--how glad I am that I have such a world as that to--take refuge in sometimes when this world is a little too unbearable.,m
5068,It does for me now what the fairy stories did when I was little.,m
5069,"And to think that it's true, true!",m
5070,To think that once there truly were men like that--sans peur et sans reproche!,m
5071,"It makes life worth while to think that those men lived even if it was long ago.""",m
5072,Ste.,m
5073,"Marie bent his head over the little book, for he could not look at Mlle.",m
5074,O'Hara just then.,m
5075,It seemed to him wellnigh the most pathetic speech that he had ever heard.,m
5076,His heart bled for her.,m
5077,Out of what mean shadows had the girl to turn her weary eyes upward to this sunlight of ancient heroism!,m
5078,"""And yet, mademoiselle,"" said he gently, ""I think there are such men alive to-day if only one will look for them.",m
5079,Remember! they were not common even in Bayard's time.,m
5080,"Oh yes, I think there are preux chevaliers nowadays--only perhaps they don't go about things in quite the same fashion.",m
5081,"""Other times, other manners!"" he said again.",m
5082,"""Do you know any such men?"" she demanded, facing him with shadowy eyes.",m
5083,"And he said--  ""Yes.",m
5084,I know men who are in all ways as honourable and as high-hearted as Bayard was.,m
5085,"In his place they would have acted as he did, but nowadays one has to practise heroism much less conspicuously--in the little things that few people see and that no one applauds or writes books about.",m
5086,"It is much harder to do brave little acts than brave big ones.""",m
5087,"""Yes,"" she agreed slowly.",m
5088,"""Oh yes, of course.""",m
5089,"But there was no spirit in her tone, rather a sort of apathy.",m
5090,"Once more the leaves overhead swayed in the breeze, opened a tiny rift, and the little trembling rays of sunshine shot down to her where she sat.",m
5091,"She stretched out one hand cupwise, and the sunbeam, after a circling gyration, darted into it and lay there like a small golden bird panting, as it were, from flight.",m
5092,"""If I were a painter,"" said Ste.",m
5093,"Marie, ""I should be in torture and anguish of soul until I had painted you sitting there on a stone bench and holding a sunbeam in your hand.",m
5094,"I don't know what I should call the picture, but I think it would be something figurative--symbolic.",m
5095,"Can you think of a name?""",m
5096,"Coira O'Hara looked up at him with a slight smile, but her eyes were gloomy and full of dark shadows.",m
5097,"""It might be called any one of a great number of things, I should think,"" said she.",m
5098,"""Happiness--belief--illusion.",m
5099,"""See!",m
5100,"The sunbeam is gone.""                                                            Ste.",m
5101,"Marie remained in his room all the rest of that day, and he did not see Mlle.",m
5102,"O'Hara again, for Michel brought him his lunch and the old Justine his dinner.",m
5103,"For the greater part of the time he sat in bed reading, but rose now and then and moved about the room.",m
5104,His wound seemed to have suffered no great inconvenience from the morning's outing.,m
5105,"If he stood or walked too long it burned somewhat, and he had the sensation of a tight band round the leg, but this passed after he had lain down for a little while, or even sat in a chair with the leg straight out before him, so he knew that he was not to be crippled very much longer, and his thoughts began to turn more and more keenly upon the matter of escape.",m
5106,"He realised of course that now, since he was once more able to walk, he would be guarded with unremitting care every moment of the day, and quite possibly every moment of the night as well, though the simple bolting of his door on the outside would seem to answer the purpose save when he was out of doors.",m
5107,"Once he went to the two east windows and hung out of them testing, as well as he could with his hands, the strength and tenacity of the ivy which covered that side of the house.",m
5108,"He thought it seemed strong enough to give hand and foothold without being torn loose, but he was afraid it would make an atrocious amount of noise if he should try to climb down it, and besides he would need two very active legs for that.",m
5109,"At another time a fresh idea struck him, and he put it at once into action.",m
5110,"There might be just a chance, when out one day with Michel, of getting near enough to the wall which ran along the Clamart road to throw something over it when the old man was not looking.",m
5111,"In one of his pockets he had a cardcase with a little pencil fitted into a loop at one edge, and, in the case, it was his custom to carry postage stamps.",m
5112,"He investigated, found pencil and stamps.",m
5113,"Of course he had nothing but cards to write upon, and they were useless.",m
5114,"He looked about the room and went through an empty chest of drawers in vain, but at last, on some shelves in the closet where his clothes had hung, he found several large sheets of coarse white paper: the shelves were covered with it loosely for the sake of cleanliness.",m
5115,"He abstracted one of these sheets and cut it into squares of the ordinary note paper size, and he sat down and wrote a brief letter to Richard Hartley, stating where he was, that Arthur Benham was there, the O'Haras and, he thought, Captain Stewart.",m
5116,"He did not write the names out, but put instead the initial letters of each name, knowing that Hartley would understand.",m
5117,"He gave careful directions as to how the place was to be reached, and he asked Hartley to come as soon as possible by night to that wall where he himself had made his entrance, to climb up by the cedar-tree, and to drop his answer into the thick leaves of the lilac bushes immediately beneath--an answer naming a day and hour, preferably by night, when he could return with three or four to help him, surprise the household at La Lierre, and carry off young Benham.",m
5118,Ste.,m
5119,"Marie wrote this letter four times, and each of the four copies he enclosed in an awkwardly fashioned envelope, made with infinite pains so that its flaps folded in together, for he had no gum.",m
5120,"He addressed and stamped the four envelopes, and put them all in his pocket to await the first opportunity.",m
5121,"Afterwards he lay down for awhile and, as, one after another, the books he had in the room failed to interest him, his thoughts began to turn back to Mlle.",m
5122,Coira O'Hara and his hour with her upon the old stone bench in the garden.,m
5123,"He realized all at once that he had been putting off this reflection as one puts off a reckoning that one a little dreads to face, and rather vaguely he realised why.",m
5124,The spell that the girl wielded--quite without being conscious of it: he granted her that grace--was too potent.,m
5125,"It was dangerous, and he knew it.",m
5126,"Even imaginative and very unpractical people can be in some things surprisingly matter-of-fact, and Ste.",m
5127,Marie was matter-of-fact about this.,m
5128,"The girl had made a mysterious and unprecedented appeal to him at his very first sight of her, long before, and ever since that time she had continued, intermittently at least, to haunt his dreams.",m
5129,Now he was in the very house with her.,m
5130,"It was quite possible that he might see her and speak with her every day, and he knew there was peril in that.",m
5131,"He closed his eyes and she came to him, dark and beautiful, magnetically vital, spreading enchantment about her like a fragrance.",m
5132,"She sat beside him on the moss-stained bench in the garden, holding out her hand cupwise, and a sunbeam lay in the hand like a little golden fluttering bird.",m
5133,His thoughts ran back to that first morning when he had narrowly escaped death by poison.,m
5134,He remembered the girl's agony of fear and horror.,m
5135,"He felt her hands once more upon his shoulders, and he was aware that his breath was coming faster and that his heart beat quickly.",m
5136,"He got to his feet and went across to one of the windows, and he stood there for a long time frowning out into the summer day.",m
5137,"If ever in his life, he said to himself with some deliberation, he was to need a cool and clear head, faculties unclouded and unimpaired by emotion, it was now in these next few days.",m
5138,Much more than his own well-being depended upon him now.,m
5139,The fates of a whole family and quite possibly the lives of some of them were in his hands.,m
5140,"He must not fail and he must not, in any least way, falter.",m
5141,"For enemies he had a band of desperate adventurers, and the very boy himself, the centre and reason for the whole plot, had been, in some incomprehensible way, so played upon that he too was against him.",m
5142,The man standing by the window forced himself quite deliberately to look the plain facts in the face.,m
5143,"He compelled himself to envisage this beautiful girl with her tragic eyes for just what his reason knew her to be--an adventuress, a decoy, a lure to a callow impressionable foolish lad, the tool of that arch-villain Stewart and of the lesser villain her father.",m
5144,It was like standing by and watching something lovely and pitiful vilely befouled.,m
5145,"It turned his heart sick within him, but he held himself to the task.",m
5146,He brought to aid him the vision of his lady in whose cause he was pursuing this adventure.,m
5147,"For strength and determination he reached eye and hand to her where she sat enthroned, calm-browed, serene.",m
5148,"For the first time since the beginning of all things his lady failed him, and Ste.",m
5149,Marie turned cold with fear.,m
5150,Where was that splendid frenzy that had been wont to sweep him all in an instant into upper air--set his feet upon the stars?,m
5151,Where was it?,m
5152,The man gave a sudden voiceless cry of horror.,m
5153,The wings that had such countless times upborne him fluttered weakly near the earth and could not mount.,m
5154,"His lady was there: through infinite space he was aware of her, but she was cold and aloof and her eyes gazed very serenely beyond, at something he could not see.",m
5155,He knew well enough that the fault lay somewhere within himself.,m
5156,"She was as she had ever been, but he lacked the strength to rise to her.",m
5157,Why?,m
5158,Why?,m
5159,"He searched himself with a desperate earnestness, but he could find no answer to his questioning.",m
5160,"In himself, as in her, there had come no change.",m
5161,"She was still to him all that she ever had been--the star of his destiny, the pillar of fire by night, of cloud by day, to guide him on his path.",m
5162,"Where then the fine pure fervour that should, at thought of her, whirl him on high and make a god of him?",m
5163,"He stood wrapped in bewilderment and despair, for he could find no answer.",m
5164,"In plain words, in commonplace black and white, the man's anguish has an over-fanciful, a wellnigh absurd look, but to Ste.",m
5165,"Marie the thing was very real and terrible: as real and as terrible as, to a half-starved monk in his lonely cell, the sudden failure of the customary exaltation of spirit after a night's long prayer.",m
5166,"He went after a time back to the bed and lay down there, with one upflung arm across his eyes to shut out the light.",m
5167,He was filled with a profound dejection and a sense of hopelessness.,m
5168,"Through all the long week of his imprisonment he had been cheerful, at times even gay.",m
5169,"However evil his case might have looked, his elastic spirits had mounted above all difficulties and cares, confident in the face of apparent defeat.",m
5170,"Now at last he lay still, bruised, as it were, and battered and weary.",m
5171,The flame of courage burnt very low in him.,m
5172,"From sheer exhaustion he fell after a time into a troubled sleep, but even there the enemy followed him and would not let him rest.",m
5173,He seemed to himself to be in a place of shadows and fear.,m
5174,"He strained his eyes to make out above him the bright clear star of guidance, for so long as that shone he was safe, but something had come between--cloud or mist--and his star shone dimly in fitful glimpses.",m
5175,"On the next morning he went out once more, with old Michel, into the garden.",m
5176,"He went with a stronger heart, for the morning had renewed his courage, as bright fresh mornings do.",m
5177,From the anguish of the day before he held himself carefully aloof.,m
5178,"He kept his mind away from all thought of it, and gave his attention to the things about him.",m
5179,"It would return doubtless in the slow idle hours; he would have to face it again, and yet again; he would have to contend with it: but for the present he put it out of his thoughts, for there were things to do.",m
5180,It was no more than human of him--and certainly it was very characteristic of Ste.,m
5181,Marie--that he should be half glad and half disappointed at not finding Coira O'Hara in her place at the rond point.,m
5182,"It left him free to do what he wished to do--make a careful reconnaissance of the whole garden enclosure--but it left him empty of something he had, without conscious thought, looked forward to.",m
5183,"His wounded leg was stronger and more flexible than on the day before: it burnt and prickled less, and could be bent a little at the knee with small distress, so he led the old Michel at a good pace down the length of the enclosure, past the rose gardens--a tangle of unkempt sweetness--and so to the opposite wall.",m
5184,"He found the gates there, very formidable-looking, made of vertical iron bars connected by cross pieces and an ornamental scroll.",m
5185,They were fastened together by a heavy chain and a padlock.,m
5186,"The lock was covered with rust, as were the gates themselves, and Ste.",m
5187,"Marie observed that the lane outside upon which they gave was overgrown with turf and moss and even with seedling shrubs, so he felt sure that this entrance was never used.",m
5188,"The lane, he noted, swept away to the right, towards Fort d'Issy and not towards the Clamart road.",m
5189,"He heard, as he stood there, the whirr of a tram from far away at the left--a tram bound to or from Clamart--and the sound brought to his mind what he wished to do.",m
5190,"He turned about and began to make his way round the rose gardens, which were partly enclosed by a low brick wall some two or three feet high.",m
5191,"Beyond them the trees and shrubbery were not set out in orderly rows as they were near the house, but grew at will without hindrance or care.",m
5192,It was like a bit of the Meudon wood.,m
5193,"He found the going more difficult here for his bad leg, but he pressed on and in a little while saw before him that wall which skirted the Clamart road.",m
5194,"He felt in his pocket for the four sealed and stamped letters, but just then the old Michel spoke behind him.",m
5195,"""Pardon, monsieur!",m
5196,"Il n'est pas permis.""",m
5197,"""What is not permitted?"" demanded Ste.",m
5198,"Marie, wheeling about.",m
5199,"""To approach that wall, monsieur,"" said the old man with an incredibly gnome-like and apologetic grin.",m
5200,Ste.,m
5201,Marie gave an exclamation of disgust.,m
5202,"""Is it believed that I could leap over it?"" he asked.",m
5203,"""A matter of five metres?",m
5204,Merci non!,m
5205,I am not so agile.,m
5206,"You flatter me.""",m
5207,The old Michel spread out his two gnarled hands.,m
5208,"""Pas de ma faute.",m
5209,"I have orders, monsieur.",m
5210,"It will be my painful duty to shoot if monsieur approaches that wall.""",m
5211,He turned his strange head on one side and regarded Ste.,m
5212,Marie with his sharp and bead-like eye.,m
5213,"The smile of apology still distorted his face, and he looked exactly like the Punchinello in a street show.",m
5214,Ste.,m
5215,"Marie slowly withdrew from his pocket two louis d'or, and held them before him in the palm of his hand.",m
5216,"He looked down upon them and Michel looked too, with a gaze so intense that his solitary eye seemed to project a very little from his withered face.",m
5217,He was like a hypnotised old bird.,m
5218,"""Mon vieux,"" said Ste.",m
5219,Marie.,m
5220,"""I am a man of honour.""",m
5221,"""Surement!",m
5222,"Surement, monsieur!"" said the old Michel politely, but his hypnotised gaze did not stir so much as a hair's-breadth.",m
5223,"""Ca va sans le dire.""",m
5224,"""A man of honour,"" repeated Ste.",m
5225,Marie.,m
5226,"""When I give my word I keep it.",m
5227,Voila!,m
5228,"I keep it.""",m
5229,"""And,"" said he, ""I have here forty francs.",m
5230,Two louis.,m
5231,A large sum.,m
5232,"It is yours, my brave Michel, for the mere trouble of turning your back just thirty seconds.""",m
5233,"""Monsieur,"" whispered the old man, ""it is impossible.",m
5234,"He would kill me--by torture.""",m
5235,"""He will never know,"" said Ste.",m
5236,"Marie, ""for I do not mean to try to escape.",m
5237,I give you my word of honour that I shall not try to escape.,m
5238,"Besides, I could not climb over that wall, as you see.",m
5239,"""Two louis, Michel!",m
5240,"Forty francs!""",m
5241,"The old man's hands twisted and trembled round the barrel of the carbine, and he swallowed once with some difficulty.",m
5242,He seemed to hesitate but in the end he shook his head.,m
5243,It was as if he shook it in grief over the grave of his firstborn.,m
5244,"""It is impossible,"" he said again.",m
5245,"""Impossible.""",m
5246,"He tore the bead-like eye away from those two beautiful glowing golden things, and Ste.",m
5247,Marie saw that there was nothing to be done with him just now.,m
5248,"He slipped the money back into his pocket with a little sigh, and turned away towards the rose gardens.",m
5249,"""Ah well,"" said he.",m
5250,"""Another time perhaps.",m
5251,Another time.,m
5252,"And there are more louis still, mon vieux.",m
5253,Perhaps three or four.,m
5254,"Who knows?""",m
5255,"Michel emitted a groan of extreme anguish, and they moved on.",m
5256,But a few moments later Ste.,m
5257,"Marie gave a sudden low exclamation and then a soundless laugh, for he caught sight of a very familiar figure seated in apparent dejection upon a fallen tree trunk and staring across the tangled splendour of the roses.                                                                Captain Stewart had good reason to look depressed on that fresh and beautiful morning when Ste.",m
5258,Marie happened upon him beside the rose gardens.,m
5259,Matters had not gone well with him of late.,m
5260,"He was ill and he was frightened, and he was much nearer than is agreeable to a complete nervous breakdown.",m
5261,It seemed to him that perils beset him upon every side: perils both seen and unseen.,m
5262,"He felt like a man who is hunted in the dark, hard pressed until his strength is gone and he can go no farther.",m
5263,"He imagined himself to be that man shivering in the gloom in a strange place, hiding eyes and ears lest he see or hear something from which he cannot escape.",m
5264,"He imagined the morning light to come very slow and cold and grey, and in it he saw round about him a silent ring of enemies, the men who had pursued him and run him down.",m
5265,"He saw them standing there in the pale dawn, motionless, waiting for the day, and he knew that at last the chase was over and he was done for.",m
5266,"Crouching alone in the garden with the scent of roses in his nostrils, he wondered with a great and bitter amazement at that madman--himself of only a few months ago--who had sat down deliberately, in his proper senses, to play at cards with Fate, the great winner of all games.",m
5267,"He wondered if, after all, he had been in his proper senses, for the deed now loomed before him gigantic and hideous in its criminal folly.",m
5268,"His mind went drearily back to the beginning of it all, to the tremendous debts which had hounded him day and night; to his fear to speak of them with his father, who had never had the least mercy upon gamblers.",m
5269,"He remembered, as if it were yesterday, the afternoon upon which he learnt of young Arthur's quarrel with his grandfather, old David's senile anger, and the boy's tempestuous exit from the house, vowing never to return.",m
5270,"He remembered his talk with old David later on about the will, in which he learnt that he was now to have Arthur's share under certain conditions.",m
5271,"He remembered how that very evening, three days after his disappearance, the lad had come secretly to the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
5272,"Honore, begging his uncle to take him in for a few days, and how, in a single instant that was like a lightning flash, the Great Idea had come to him.",m
5273,What gigantic and appalling madness it had all been!,m
5274,"And yet, for a time, how easy of execution.",m
5275,For a time.,m
5276,Now ...,m
5277,"He gave another quick shiver, for his mind came back to what beset him and compassed him round about.",m
5278,Perils seen and hidden.,m
5279,The peril seen was ever before his eyes.,m
5280,"Against the light of day it loomed a gigantic and portentous shadow, and it threatened him--the figure of Ste.",m
5281,Marie who knew.,m
5282,"His reason told him that, if due care were used, this danger need not be too formidable, and indeed in his heart he rather despised Ste.",m
5283,"Marie as an individual; but the man's nerve was broken and, in these days, fear swept wave-like over reason and had its way with him.",m
5284,"Fear looked up to this looming portentous shadow, and saw there youth and health and strength, courage and hopefulness, and (best of all armours) a righteous cause.",m
5285,How was an ill and tired and wicked old man to fight against these?,m
5286,"It became an obsession, the figure of this youth: it darkened the sun at noonday, and at night it stood beside Captain Stewart's bed in the darkness and watched him and waited, and the very air he breathed came chill and dark from its silent presence there.",m
5287,But there were perils unseen as well as seen.,m
5288,"He felt invisible threads drawing round him, weaving closer and closer, and he dared not even try how strong they were lest they prove to be cables of steel.",m
5289,He was almost certain that his niece knew something or at the least suspected.,m
5290,"As has already been pointed out, the two saw very little of each other, but on the occasions of their last few meetings it had seemed to him that the girl watched him with a strange stare, and tried always to be in her grandfather's chamber when he called to make his inquiries.",m
5291,"Once, stirred by a moment's bravado, he asked her if M. Ste.",m
5292,"Marie had returned from his mysterious absence, and the girl said--  ""No.  He has not come back yet, but I expect him soon now--with news of Arthur.",m
5293,"We shall all be very glad to see him, grandfather and Richard Hartley and I.""",m
5294,"It was not a very consequential speech, and to tell the truth it was what, in the girl's own country, would be termed pure ""bluff,"" but to Captain Stewart it rang harsh and loud with evil significance, and he went out of that room cold at heart.",m
5295,What plans were they perfecting among them?,m
5296,What invisible nets for his feet?,m
5297,And there was another thing still.,m
5298,Within the past two or three days he had become convinced that his movements were being watched.,m
5299,"(And that would be Richard Hartley at work, he said to himself.)",m
5300,"Faces vaguely familiar began to confront him in the street, in restaurants and cafes.",m
5301,"Once he thought his rooms had been ransacked during his absence at La Lierre, though his servant stoutly maintained that they had never been left unoccupied save for a half-hour's marketing.",m
5302,"Finally, on the day before this morning by the rose gardens, he was sure that as he came out from the city in his car he was followed at a long distance by another motor.",m
5303,"He saw it behind him after he had left the city gate, the Porte de Versailles, and he saw it again after he had left the main route at Issy, and entered the little Rue Barbes which led to La Lierre.",m
5304,Of course he promptly did the only possible thing under the circumstances.,m
5305,"He dashed on past the long stretch of wall, swung into the main avenue beyond and continued, through Clamart, to the Meudon wood, as if he were going to St.",m
5306,Cloud.,m
5307,"In the labyrinth of roads and lanes there he came to a halt, and after a half-hour's wait ran slowly back to La Lierre.",m
5308,"There was no further sign of the other car, the pursuer, if so it had been; but he passed two or three men on bicycles and others walking, and what one of these might not be a spy paid to track him down?",m
5309,"It had frightened him badly, that hour of suspense and flight, and he determined to remain at La Lierre for at least a few days, and wrote to his servant in the Rue du Faubourg to forward his letters there under the false name by which he had hired the place.",m
5310,He was thinking very wearily of all these things as he sat on the fallen tree trunk in the garden and stared unseeing across tangled ranks of roses.,m
5311,"And after awhile his thoughts, as they were wont to do, returned to Ste.",m
5312,"Marie--that looming shadow which darkened the sunlight, that incubus of fear which clung to him night and day.",m
5313,He was so absorbed that he did not hear sounds which might otherwise have roused him.,m
5314,"He heard nothing, saw nothing, save that which his fevered mind projected, until a voice spoke his name.",m
5315,He looked over his shoulder thinking that O'Hara had sought him out.,m
5316,"He turned a little on the tree trunk to see more easily, and the image of his dread stood there a living and very literal shadow against the daylight.",m
5317,Captain Stewart's overstrained nerves were in no state to bear a sudden shock.,m
5318,"He gave a voiceless, whispering cry, and he began to tremble very violently so that his teeth chattered.",m
5319,"All at once he got to his feet and began to stumble away backwards, but a projecting limb of the fallen tree caught him and held him fast.",m
5320,It must be that the man was in a sort of frenzy.,m
5321,"He must have seen through a red mist just then, for when he found that he could not escape his hand went swiftly to his coat pocket, and in his white and contorted face there was murder, plain and unmistakable.",m
5322,Ste.,m
5323,Marie was too lame to spring aside or to dash upon the man across intervening obstacles and defend himself.,m
5324,He stood still in his place and waited.,m
5325,"And it was characteristic of him that at that moment he felt no fear, only a fine sense of exhilaration.",m
5326,Open danger had no terrors for him.,m
5327,"It was secret peril that unnerved him, as in the matter of the poison a week before.",m
5328,Captain Stewart's hand fell away empty and Ste.,m
5329,Marie laughed.,m
5330,"""Left it at the house?"" said he.",m
5331,"""You seem to have no luck, Stewart.",m
5332,First the cat drinks the poison and then you leave your pistol at home.,m
5333,Dear!  dear!,m
5334,"I'm afraid you're careless.""",m
5335,Captain Stewart stared at the younger man under his brows.,m
5336,"His face was grey and he was still shivering, but the sudden agony of fear, which had been after all only a jangle of nerves, was gone away.",m
5337,He looked upon Ste.,m
5338,"Marie's gay and untroubled face with a dull wonder, and he began to feel a grudging admiration for the man who could face death without even turning pale.",m
5339,He pulled out his watch and looked at it.,m
5340,"""I did not know,"" he said, ""that this was your hour out of doors.""",m
5341,As a matter of fact he had quite forgotten that the arrangement existed.,m
5342,"When he had first heard of it he had protested vigorously, but had been overborne by O'Hara with the plea that they owed their prisoner something for having come near to poisoning him, and Stewart did not care to have any further attention called to that matter: it had already put a severe strain upon the relations at La Lierre.",m
5343,"""Well,"" observed Ste.",m
5344,"Marie, ""I told you you were careless.",m
5345,That proves it.,m
5346,Come!,m
5347,Can't we sit down for a little chat?,m
5348,I haven't seen you since I was your guest at the other address--the town address.,m
5349,"It seems to have become a habit of mine, doesn't it?  being your guest.""",m
5350,"He laughed cheerfully, but Captain Stewart continued to regard him without smiling.",m
5351,"""If you imagine,"" said the elder man, ""that this place belongs to me you are mistaken.",m
5352,"I came here to-day to make a visit.""",m
5353,But Ste.,m
5354,Marie sat down at one end of the tree trunk and shook his head.,m
5355,"""Oh, come, come!"" said he.",m
5356,"""Why keep up the pretence?",m
5357,"You must know that I know all about the whole affair Why, bless you, I know it all--even to the provisions of the will.",m
5358,Did you think I stumbled in here by accident?,m
5359,"Well, I didn't, though I don't mind admitting to you that I remained by accident.""",m
5360,"He glanced over his shoulder towards the one-eyed Michel, who stood near by regarding the two with some alarm.",m
5361,"Captain Stewart looked up sharply at the mention of the will, and he wetted his dry lips with his tongue.",m
5362,"But after a moment's hesitation he sat down upon the tree trunk, and he seemed to shrink a little together, when his limbs and shoulders had relaxed, so that he looked small and feeble, like a very tired old man.",m
5363,"He remained silent for a few moments, but at last he spoke without raising his eyes.",m
5364,"He said--  ""And now that you--imagine yourself to know so very much, what do you expect to do about it?""",m
5365,Ste.,m
5366,Marie laughed again.,m
5367,"""Ah, that would be telling!"" he cried.",m
5368,"""You see, in one way I have the advantage (though outwardly all the advantage seems to be with your side): I know all about your game.",m
5369,I may call it a game?,m
5370,Yes?,m
5371,But you don't know mine.,m
5372,You don't know what I--what we may do at any moment.,m
5373,"That's where we have the better of you.""",m
5374,"""It would seem to me,"" said Captain Stewart wearily, ""that since you are a prisoner here and very unlikely to escape, we know with great accuracy what you will do--and what you will not.""",m
5375,"""Yes,"" admitted Ste.",m
5376,Marie.,m
5377,"""It would seem so.",m
5378,It certainly would seem so.,m
5379,"But you never can tell, can you?""",m
5380,And at that the elder man frowned and looked away.,m
5381,"Thereafter another brief silence fell between the two, but at its end Ste.",m
5382,"Marie spoke in a new tone, a very serious tone.",m
5383,"He said--  ""Stewart, listen a moment!"" and the other turned a sharp gaze upon him.",m
5384,"""You mustn't forget,"" said Ste.",m
5385,"Marie, speaking slowly as if to choose his words with care--""you mustn't forget that I am not alone in this matter.",m
5386,You mustn't forget that there's Richard Hartley--and that there are others too.,m
5387,"I'm a prisoner, yes, I'm helpless here for the present--perhaps--perhaps, but they are not, and they know, Stewart.",m
5388,"They know.""",m
5389,"Captain Stewart's face remained grey and still, but his hands twisted and shook upon his knees until he hid them.",m
5390,"""I know well enough what you're waiting for,"" continued Ste.",m
5391,Marie.,m
5392,"""You're waiting--you've got to wait, for Arthur Benham to come of age, or, better yet, for your father to die.""",m
5393,He paused and shook his head.,m
5394,"""It's no good.",m
5395,You can't hold out as long as that--not by half.,m
5396,We shall have won the game long before.,m
5397,Listen to me!,m
5398,Do you know what would occur if your father should take a serious turn for the worse to-night--or at any time?,m
5399,Do you?,m
5400,"Well, I'll tell you.",m
5401,A piece of information would be given him that would make another change in that will just as quickly as a pen could write the words.,m
5402,"That's what would happen.""",m
5403,"""That is a lie!"" said Captain Stewart in a dry whisper.",m
5404,"""A lie.""",m
5405,And Ste.,m
5406,Marie contented himself with a slight smile by way of answer.,m
5407,"He was by no means sure that what he said was true, but he argued that since Hartley suspected or, perhaps by this time, knew so much, he would certainly not allow old David to die without doing what he could do in an effort to save young Arthur's fortune from a rascal.",m
5408,"In any event, true or false, the words had had the desired effect.",m
5409,Captain Stewart was plainly frightened by them.,m
5410,"""May I make a suggestion?"" asked the younger man.",m
5411,The other did not answer him and he made it.,m
5412,"""Give it up!"" said he.",m
5413,"""You're riding for a tremendous fall, you know.",m
5414,We shall smash you completely in the end.,m
5415,It'll mean worse than ruin--much worse.,m
5416,"Give it up, now, before you're too late.",m
5417,"Help me to send for Hartley, and we'll take the boy back to his home.",m
5418,"Some story can be managed that will leave you out of the thing altogether, and those who know will hold their tongues.",m
5419,"It's your last chance, Stewart.",m
5420,"I advise you to take it.""",m
5421,Captain Stewart turned his grey face slowly and looked at the other man with a sort of dull and apathetic wonder.,m
5422,"""Are you mad?"" he asked in a voice which was altogether without feeling of any kind.",m
5423,"""Are you quite mad?""",m
5424,"""On the contrary,"" said Ste.",m
5425,"Marie, ""I am quite sane, and I'm offering you a chance to save yourself before it's too late.",m
5426,"""Don't misunderstand me!"" he said.",m
5427,"""I am not urging this out of any sympathy for you.",m
5428,"I urge it because it will bring about what I wish a little more quickly, also because it will save your family from the disgrace of your smash-up.",m
5429,"That's why I'm making my suggestion.""",m
5430,"Captain Stewart was silent for a little while, but after that he got heavily to his feet.",m
5431,"""I think you must be quite mad,"" said he, as before, in a voice altogether devoid of expression.",m
5432,"""I cannot talk with madmen.""",m
5433,"He beckoned to the old Michel, who stood near-by leaning upon his carbine, and when the gardener had approached, he said--  ""Take this--prisoner back to his room!""",m
5434,Ste.,m
5435,Marie rose with a little sigh.,m
5436,"He said--  ""I'm sorry, but you'll admit I have done my best for you.",m
5437,I've warned you.,m
5438,I shan't do it again.,m
5439,"We shall smash you now, without mercy.""",m
5440,"""Take him away!"" cried Captain Stewart in a sudden loud voice, and the old Michel touched his charge upon the shoulder.",m
5441,So Ste.,m
5442,Marie went without further words.,m
5443,"From a little distance he looked back, and the other man still stood by the fallen tree trunk, bent a little, his arms hanging lax beside him, and his face, Ste.",m
5444,"Marie thought fancifully, was like the face of a man damned.                                                          The one bird-like eye of the old Michel regarded Ste.",m
5445,Marie with a glance of mingled cunning and humour.,m
5446,It might have been said to twinkle.,m
5447,"""To the east, monsieur?"" inquired the old Michel.",m
5448,"""Precisely!"" said Ste.",m
5449,Marie.,m
5450,"""To the east, mon vieux.""",m
5451,It was the morning of the fourth day after that talk with Captain Stewart beside the rose gardens.,m
5452,"The two bore to the eastward, down among the trees, and presently came to the spot where a certain trespasser had once leapt down from the top of the high wall and had been shot for his pains.",m
5453,The old Michel halted and leant upon the barrel of his carbine.,m
5454,"With an air of complete detachment, an air vague and aloof as of one in a reverie, he gazed away over the tree-tops of the ragged park; but Ste.",m
5455,"Marie went in under the row of lilac shrubs which stood close against the wall, and a passer-by might have thought the man looking for figs on thistles--for lilacs in late July.",m
5456,"He had gone there with eagerness, with flushed cheeks and bright eyes; he emerged, after some moments, moving slowly, with downcast head.",m
5457,"""There are no lilac blooms now, monsieur,"" observed the old Michel, and his prisoner said in a low voice--  ""No, mon vieux.",m
5458,"No.  There are none.""",m
5459,He sighed and drew a long breath.,m
5460,"So the two stood for some time silent, Ste.",m
5461,"Marie a little pale, his eyes fixed upon the ground, his hands chafing together behind him: the gardener with his one bright eye upon his charge.",m
5462,But in the end Ste.,m
5463,"Marie sighed again and began to move away, followed by the gardener.",m
5464,"They went across the broad park, past the double row of larches, through that space where the chestnut trees stood in straight close rows, and so came to the west wall which skirted the road to Clamart.",m
5465,Ste.,m
5466,"Marie felt in his pocket and withdrew the last of the four letters--the last there could be, for he had no more stamps.",m
5467,"The others he had thrown over the wall, one each morning, beginning with the day after he had made the first attempt to bribe old Michel.",m
5468,"As he had expected, twenty-four hours of avaricious reflection had proved too much for that gnome-like being.",m
5469,"One each day he had thrown over the wall, weighted with a pebble tucked loosely under the flap of the improvised envelope in such a manner that it would drop out when the letter struck the ground beyond.",m
5470,"And each following day he had gone with high hopes to the appointed place under the cedar-tree to pick figs of thistles, lilac blooms in late July.",m
5471,But there had been nothing there.,m
5472,"""Turn your back, Michel!"" said Ste.",m
5473,Marie.,m
5474,"And the old man said from a little distance--  ""It is turned, monsieur.",m
5475,I see nothing.,m
5476,Monsieur throws little stones at the birds to amuse himself.,m
5477,"It does not concern me.""",m
5478,Ste.,m
5479,Marie slipped a pebble under the flap of the envelope and threw his letter over the wall.,m
5480,"It went like a soaring bird, whirling horizontally, and it must have fallen far out in the middle of the road near the tramway.",m
5481,For the third time that morning the prisoner drew a sigh.,m
5482,"He said--  ""You may turn round now, my friend,"" and the old Michel faced him.",m
5483,"""We have shot our last arrow,"" said he.",m
5484,"""If this also fails, I think--well, I think the bon Dieu will have to help us then.",m
5485,"""Michel,"" he inquired, ""do you know how to pray?""",m
5486,"""Sacred thousand swine, no!"" cried the ancient gnome in something between astonishment and horror.",m
5487,"""No, monsieur.",m
5488,"Pas mon metier, ca!""",m
5489,He shook his head rapidly from side to side like one of those toys in a shop window whose heads oscillate upon a pivot.,m
5490,But all at once a gleam of inspiration sparkled in his lone eye.,m
5491,"""There is the old Justine!"" he suggested.",m
5492,"""Toujours sur les genoux, cette imbecile la.""",m
5493,"""In that case,"" said Ste.",m
5494,"Marie, ""you might ask the lady to say one little extra prayer for--the pebble I threw at the birds just now.",m
5495,"Hein?""",m
5496,"He withdrew from his pocket the last two louis d'or, and Michel took them in a trembling hand.",m
5497,There remained but the note of fifty francs and some silver.,m
5498,"""The prayer shall be said, monsieur,"" declared the gardener.",m
5499,"""It shall be said.",m
5500,"She shall pray all night or I will kill her.""",m
5501,"""Thank you!"" said Ste.",m
5502,Marie.,m
5503,"""You are kindness itself.",m
5504,"A gentle soul.""",m
5505,"They turned away to retrace their steps, and Michel rubbed the side of his head with a reflective air.",m
5506,"""The old one is a madman,"" said he.",m
5507,"The ""old one"" meant Captain Stewart.",m
5508,"""A madman.",m
5509,"Each day he is madder, and this morning he struck me--here on the head, because I was too slow.",m
5510,"Eh! a little more of that, and--who knows?",m
5511,"Just a little more, a small little!",m
5512,"Am I a dog, to be beaten?",m
5513,Hein?,m
5514,Je ne le crois pas.,m
5515,"He!""",m
5516,"He called Captain Stewart two unprintable names, and, after a moment's thought, he called him an animal, which is not so much of an anti-climax as it may seem, because to call anybody an animal in French is a serious matter.",m
5517,"The gardener was working himself up into something of a quiet passion, and Ste.",m
5518,"Marie said--  ""Softly, my friend!",m
5519,"Softly!""",m
5520,"It occurred to him that the man's resentment might be of use, later on, and he said--  ""You speak the truth.",m
5521,"The old one is an animal, and he is also a great rascal.""",m
5522,But Michel betrayed the makings of a philosopher.,m
5523,"He said with profound conviction--  ""Monsieur, all men are great rascals.",m
5524,"It is I who say it.""",m
5525,And at that Ste.,m
5526,Marie had to laugh.,m
5527,"He had not consciously directed his feet, but without direction they led him round the corner of the rose gardens and towards the rond point.",m
5528,He knew well whom he would find there.,m
5529,She had not failed him during the past three days.,m
5530,"Each morning he had found her in her place, and, for his allotted hour--which more than once stretched itself out to nearly two hours, if he had but known--they had sat together on the stone bench or, tiring of that, had walked under the trees beyond.",m
5531,Long afterwards Ste.,m
5532,"Marie looked back upon these hours with, among other emotions, a great wonder, at himself and at her.",m
5533,"It seemed to him then one of the strangest relationships--intimacies, for it might well be so called--that ever existed between a man and a woman, and he was amazed at the ease, the unconsciousness with which it had come about.",m
5534,But during this time he did not allow himself to wonder or to examine--scarcely even to think.,m
5535,"The hours were golden hours, unrelated, he told himself, to anything else in his life or in his interest.",m
5536,"They were like pleasant dreams, very sweet while they endured, but to be put away and forgotten upon the waking.",m
5537,"Only, in that long afterwards, he knew that they had not been put away, that they had been with him always, that the morning hour had remained in his thoughts all the rest of the long day, and that he had waked upon the morrow with a keen and exquisite sense of something sweet to come.",m
5538,"It was a strange fool's paradise that the man dwelt in, and in some small vague measure he must, even at the time, have known it, for it is certain that he deliberately held himself away from thought--realisation; that he deliberately shut his eyes, held his ears, lest he should hear or see.",m
5539,That he was not faithless to his duty has been shown.,m
5540,"He did his utmost there, but he was for the time helpless save for efforts to communicate with Richard Hartley, and those efforts could consume no more than ten minutes out of the weary day.",m
5541,"So he drifted, wilfully blind to bearings, wilfully deaf to sound of warning or peril, and he found a companionship sweeter and fuller and more perfect than he had ever before known in all his life, though that is not to say very much, because sympathetic companionships between men and women are very rare indeed, and Ste.",m
5542,Marie had never experienced anything which could fairly be called by that name.,m
5543,"He had had, as has been related, many flirtations and not a few so-called love affairs; but neither of these two sorts of intimacies are of necessity true intimacies at all: men often feel varying degrees of love for women without the least true understanding or sympathy or real companionship.",m
5544,"He was wondering as he bore round the corner of the rose gardens, on this day, in just what mood he would find her.",m
5545,"It seemed to him that in their brief acquaintance he had seen her in almost all the moods there are, from bitter gloom to the irrepressible gaiety of a little child.",m
5546,"He had told her once that she was like an organ, and she had laughed at him for being pretentious and high-flown, though she could upon occasion be quite high-flown enough herself for all ordinary purposes.",m
5547,"He reached the cleared margin of the rond point, and a little cold fear stirred in him when he did not hear her singing under her breath, as she was wont to do when alone, but he went forward, and she was there in her place upon the stone bench.",m
5548,"She had been reading, but the book lay forgotten beside her and she sat idle, her head laid back against the thick stems of shrubbery which grew behind, her hands in her lap.",m
5549,"It was a warm still morning with the promise of a hot afternoon, and the girl was dressed in something very thin and transparent and cool-looking, open in a little square at the throat and with sleeves which came only to her elbows.",m
5550,"The material was pale and dull yellow with very vaguely defined green leaves in it, and against it the girl's dark and clear skin glowed rich and warm and living, as pearls glow and seem to throb against the dead tints of the fabric upon which they are laid.",m
5551,"She did not move when he came before her, but looked up to him gravely without stirring her head.",m
5552,"""I didn't hear you come,"" said she.",m
5553,"""You don't drag your left leg any more.",m
5554,"You walk almost as well as if you had never been wounded.""",m
5555,"""I'm almost all right again,"" he answered.",m
5556,"""I suppose I couldn't run or jump, but I certainly can walk very much like a human being.",m
5557,"May I sit down?""",m
5558,Mlle.,m
5559,"O'Hara put out one hand and drew the book closer to make a place for him on the stone bench, and he settled himself comfortably there, turned a little so that he was facing towards her.",m
5560,"It was indicative of the state of intimacy into which the two had grown that they did not make polite conversation with each other, but indeed were silent for some little time after Ste.",m
5561,Marie had seated himself.,m
5562,It was he who spoke first.,m
5563,"He said--  ""You look vaguely classical to-day.",m
5564,I have been trying to guess why and I cannot.,m
5565,"Perhaps it's because your--what does one say: frock, dress, gown? because it is cut out square at the throat.""",m
5566,"""If you mean by classical, Greek,"" said she, ""it wouldn't be square at the neck at all.",m
5567,It would be pointed--V-shaped.,m
5568,And it would be very different in other ways too.,m
5569,"You are not an observing person after all.""",m
5570,"""For all that,"" insisted Ste.",m
5571,"Marie, ""you look classical.",m
5572,"You look like some lady one reads about in Greek poems--Helen or Iphigenia or Medea or somebody.""",m
5573,"""Helen had yellow hair, hadn't she?"" objected Mlle.",m
5574,O'Hara.,m
5575,"""I should think I probably look more like Medea: Medea in Colchis before Jason----""  She seemed suddenly to realise that she had hit upon an unfortunate example, for she stopped short in the middle of her sentence, and a wave of colour swept up over her throat and face.",m
5576,For a moment Ste.,m
5577,"Marie did not understand, then he gave a low exclamation, for Medea certainly had been an unhappy name.",m
5578,He remembered something that Richard Hartley had said about that lady a long time before.,m
5579,"He made another mistake, for to lessen the moment's embarrassment he gave speech to the first thought which entered his mind.",m
5580,"He said--  ""Some one once remarked that you looked like the young Juno--before marriage.",m
5581,"I expect it's true too.""",m
5582,She turned upon him swiftly.,m
5583,"""Who said that?"" she demanded.",m
5584,"""Who has ever talked to you about me?""",m
5585,"""I beg your pardon!"" he said.",m
5586,"""I seem to be singularly stupid this morning.",m
5587,A mild lunacy.,m
5588,"You must forgive me, if you can.",m
5589,"To tell you what you ask would be to enter upon forbidden ground, and I mustn't do that.""",m
5590,"""Still, I should like to know,"" said the girl watching him with sombre eyes.",m
5591,"""Well then,"" said he, ""it was a little Jewish photographer in the Boulevard de la Madeleine.""",m
5592,"And she said--  ""Oh!"" in a rather disappointed tone and looked away.",m
5593,"""We seem to be making conversation chiefly about my personal appearance,"" she said presently.",m
5594,"""There must be other topics, if one should try hard to find them.",m
5595,Tell me stories!,m
5596,You told me stories yesterday; tell me more!,m
5597,You seem to be in a classical mood.,m
5598,"You shall be Odysseus, and I will be Nausicaa, the interesting laundress.",m
5599,Tell me about wanderings and things!,m
5600,"Have you any more islands for me?""",m
5601,"""Yes!"" said Ste.",m
5602,"Marie, nodding at her slowly.",m
5603,"""Yes, Nausicaa, I have more islands for you.",m
5604,The seas are full of islands.,m
5605,"What kind do you want?""",m
5606,"""A warm one,"" said the girl.",m
5607,"""Even on a hot day like this I choose a warm one, because I hate the cold.""",m
5608,"She settled herself more comfortably, with a little sigh of content that was exactly like a child's happy sigh when stories are going to be told before the fire.",m
5609,"""I know an island,"" said Ste.",m
5610,"Marie, ""that I think you would like because it is warm and beautiful and very far away from troubles of all kinds.",m
5611,As well as I could make out when I went there nobody on the island had ever even heard of trouble.,m
5612,"Oh yes, you'd like it.",m
5613,"The people there are brown, and they're as beautiful as their own island.",m
5614,"They wear hibiscus flowers stuck in their hair and they very seldom do any work.""",m
5615,"""I want to go there!"" cried Mlle.",m
5616,Coira O'Hara.,m
5617,"""I want to go there now, this afternoon, at once!",m
5618,"Where is it?""",m
5619,"""It's in the South Pacific,"" said he, ""not so very far from Samoa and Fiji and other groups that you will have heard about, and its name is Vavau.",m
5620,It's one of the Tongans.,m
5621,"It's a high, volcanic island, not a flat, coral one like the southern Tongans.",m
5622,"I came to it one evening, sailing north from Nukualofa and Haapai, and it looked to me like a single big mountain jutting up out of the sea, black-green against the sunset.",m
5623,It was very impressive.,m
5624,"But it isn't a single mountain, it's a lot of high broken hills covered with a tangle of vegetation and set round a narrow bay, a sort of fjord, three or four miles long, and at the inner end of this are the village and the stores of the few white traders.",m
5625,"""I'm afraid,"" said Ste.",m
5626,"Marie, shaking his head--""I'm afraid I can't tell you about it, after all.",m
5627,I can't seem to find the words.,m
5628,"You can't put into language--at least I can't--those slow hot island days that are never too hot because the trades blow fresh and strong, or the island nights that are more like black velvet with pearls sewed on it than anything else.",m
5629,You can't describe the smell of orange-groves and the look of palm-trees against the sky.,m
5630,You can't tell about the sweet simple natural hospitality of the natives.,m
5631,They're like little unsuspicious children.,m
5632,"""In short,"" said he, ""I shall have to give it up, after all, just because it's too big for me.",m
5633,"I can only say that it's beautiful and unspeakably remote from the world, and that I think I should like to go back to Vavau and stay a long time, and let the rest of the world go hang.""",m
5634,Mlle.,m
5635,"O'Hara stared across the park of La Lierre with wide and shadowy eyes, and her lips trembled a little.",m
5636,"""Oh, I want to go there!"" she cried again.",m
5637,"""I want to go there--and rest--and forget everything!""",m
5638,She turned upon him with a sudden bitter resentment.,m
5639,"""Why do you tell me things like that?"" she cried.",m
5640,"""Oh yes, I know.",m
5641,"I asked you, but----  Can't you see?",m
5642,"""To hide oneself away in a place like that!"" she said.",m
5643,"""To let the sun warm you and the trade winds blow away--all that had ever tortured you!",m
5644,"Just to rest and be at peace!""",m
5645,She turned her eyes to him once more.,m
5646,"""You needn't be afraid that you have failed to make me see your island!",m
5647,I see it.,m
5648,I feel it.,m
5649,It doesn't need many words.,m
5650,"I can shut my eyes, and I am there.",m
5651,But it was a little cruel.,m
5652,"Oh, I know, I asked for it.",m
5653,"""It's like the garden of the Hesperides, isn't it?""",m
5654,"""Very like it,"" said Ste.",m
5655,"Marie, ""because there are oranges--groves of them.",m
5656,"(And they were the golden apples, I take it.)",m
5657,"Also it is very far away from the world, and the people live in complete and careless ignorance of how the world goes on.",m
5658,"Emperors and kings die, wars come and go; but they hear only a little faint echo of it all, long afterwards, and even that doesn't interest them.""",m
5659,"""I know,"" she said.",m
5660,"""I understand.",m
5661,"Didn't you know I'd understand?""",m
5662,"""Yes,"" said he, nodding.",m
5663,"""I suppose I did.",m
5664,"We--feel things rather alike, I suppose.",m
5665,"We don't have to say them all out.""",m
5666,"""I wonder,"" she said in a low voice, ""if I'm glad or sorry.""",m
5667,She stared under her brows at the man beside her.,m
5668,"""For it is very probable that when we have left La Lierre you and I shall never meet again.",m
5669,"I wonder if I'm----""  For some obscure reason she broke off there and turned her eyes away, and she remained without speaking for a long time.",m
5670,"Her mind, as she sat there, seemed to go back to that southern island and to its peace and loveliness, for Ste.",m
5671,"Marie, who watched her, saw a little smile come to her lips, and he saw her eyes half close and grow soft and tender, as if what they saw were very sweet to her.",m
5672,"He watched many different expressions come upon the girl's face and go again, but at last he seemed to see the old bitterness return there and struggle with something wistful and eager.",m
5673,"""I envy you your wide wanderings,"" she said presently.",m
5674,"""Oh, I envy you more than I can find any words for.",m
5675,Your will is the wind's will.,m
5676,"You go where your fancy leads you, and you're free--free.",m
5677,"""We have wandered, you know,"" said she, ""my father and I.  I can't remember when we ever had a home to live in.",m
5678,"But that is--that is different--a different kind of wandering.""",m
5679,"""Yes,"" said Ste.",m
5680,Marie.,m
5681,"""Yes, perhaps.""",m
5682,"And within himself he said, with sorrow and pity: ""Different indeed!""",m
5683,As if at some sudden thought the girl looked up at him quickly.,m
5684,"""Did that sound regretful?"" she asked.",m
5685,"""Did what I say sound--disloyal to my father?",m
5686,I didn't mean it to.,m
5687,I don't want you to think that I regret it.,m
5688,I don't.,m
5689,It has meant being with my father.,m
5690,"Wherever he has gone I have gone with him, and if anything ever has been--unpleasant, I was willing, oh, I was glad, glad to put up with it for his sake and because I could be with him.",m
5691,"If I have made his life a little happier by sharing it, I am glad of everything.",m
5692,"I don't regret.""",m
5693,"""And yet,"" said Ste.",m
5694,"Marie gently, ""it must have been hard sometimes.""",m
5695,"He pictured to himself that roving existence lived among such people as O'Hara must have known, and it sent a hot wave of anger and distress over him from head to foot.",m
5696,"But the girl said--  ""I had my father.",m
5697,"The rest of it didn't matter in the face of that.""",m
5698,"After a little silence she said--  ""M. Ste.",m
5699,"Marie!""",m
5700,"And the man said--  ""What is it, mademoiselle?""",m
5701,"""You spoke the other day,"" she said, hesitating over her words, ""about my aunt, Lady Margaret Craith.",m
5702,"I suppose I ought not to ask you more about her, for my father quarrelled with his people very long ago, and he broke with them altogether.",m
5703,But--surely it can do no harm--just for a moment--just a very little!,m
5704,"Could you tell me a little about her, M. Ste.",m
5705,Marie?,m
5706,"What she is like and--and how she lives--and things like that?""",m
5707,So Ste.,m
5708,"Marie told her all that he could of the old Irishwoman who lived alone in her great house and ruled with a slack Irish hand, a sweet Irish heart, over tenants and dependants.",m
5709,"And when he had come to an end the girl drew a little sigh and said--  ""Thank you!",m
5710,I am so glad to hear of her.,m
5711,"I--wish everything were different, so that----I----think I should love her very much if I might.""",m
5712,"""Mademoiselle,"" said Ste.",m
5713,"Marie, ""will you promise me something?""",m
5714,"She looked at him with her sombre eyes, and after a little she said--  ""I am afraid you must tell me first what it is.",m
5715,"I cannot promise blindly.""",m
5716,"He said--  ""I want you to promise me that if anything ever should happen--any difficulty, trouble--anything to put you in the position of needing care or help or sympathy----""  But she broke in upon him with a swift alarm, crying--  ""What do you mean?",m
5717,You're trying to hint at something that I don't know.,m
5718,What difficulty or trouble could happen to me?,m
5719,"Please tell me just what you mean.""",m
5720,"""I'm not hinting at any mystery,"" said Ste.",m
5721,Marie.,m
5722,"""I don't know of anything that is going to happen to you, but--will you forgive me for saying it?--your father is, I take it, often exposed to danger of various sorts.",m
5723,"I'm afraid I can't quite express myself, only, if any trouble should come to you, mademoiselle, will you promise me to go to Lady Margaret, your aunt, and tell her who you are, and let her care for you?""",m
5724,"""There was an absolute break,"" she said.",m
5725,"""Complete.""",m
5726,"But the man shook his head, saying--  ""Lady Margaret won't think of that.",m
5727,"She'll think only of you--that she can mother you, perhaps save you grief--and of herself, that in her old age she has a daughter.",m
5728,"It would make a lonely old woman very happy, mademoiselle.""",m
5729,"The girl bent her head away from him, and Ste.",m
5730,"Marie saw, for the first time since he had known her, tears in her eyes.",m
5731,"After a long time she said--  ""I promise then.",m
5732,"""But,"" she said, ""it is very unlikely that it should ever come about--for more than one reason.",m
5733,"Very unlikely.""",m
5734,"""Still, mademoiselle,"" said he, ""I am glad you have promised.",m
5735,This is an uncertain world.,m
5736,"One never can tell what will come with the to-morrows.""",m
5737,"""I can,"" the girl said with a little tired smile that Ste.",m
5738,Marie did not understand.,m
5739,"""I can tell.",m
5740,"I can see all the to-morrows--a long, long row of them.",m
5741,"I know just what they're going to be like--to the very end.""",m
5742,But the man rose to his feet and looked down upon her as she sat before him.,m
5743,And he shook his head.,m
5744,"""You are mistaken,"" he said.",m
5745,"""Pardon me, but you are mistaken.",m
5746,No one can see to-morrow--or the end of anything.,m
5747,"The end may surprise you very much.""",m
5748,"""I wish it would!"" cried Mlle.",m
5749,O'Hara.,m
5750,"""Oh, I wish it would!""                                                              Ste.",m
5751,Marie put down a book as O'Hara came into the room and rose to meet his visitor.,m
5752,"""I'm compelled,"" said the Irishman, ""to put you on your honour to-day if you are to go out as usual.",m
5753,"Michel has been sent on an errand, and I am busy with letters.",m
5754,I shall have to put you on your honour not to make any effort to escape.,m
5755,Is that agreed to?,m
5756,I shall trust you altogether.,m
5757,"You could manage to scramble over the wall somehow, I suppose, and get clean away; but I think you won't try it if you give your word.""",m
5758,"""I give my word gladly,"" said Ste.",m
5759,Marie.,m
5760,"""And thanks very much.",m
5761,You've been uncommonly kind to me here.,m
5762,"I--regret more than I can say that we--that we find ourselves on opposite sides, as it were.",m
5763,"I wish we were fighting for the same cause.""",m
5764,"The Irishman looked at the younger man sharply for an instant, and he made as if he would speak, but seemed to think better of it.",m
5765,"In the end he said--  ""Yes, quite so!",m
5766,Quite so!,m
5767,"Of course you understand that any consideration I have used towards you has been by way of making amends for--for an unfortunate occurrence.""",m
5768,Ste.,m
5769,Marie laughed.,m
5770,"""The poison!"" said he.",m
5771,"""Yes, I know.",m
5772,"And, of course, I know who was at the bottom of that.",m
5773,"By the way, I met Stewart in the garden the other day.",m
5774,Did he tell you?,m
5775,"He was rather nervous and tried to shoot me, but he had left his revolver at the house--at least, it wasn't in his pocket when he reached for it.""",m
5776,"O'Hara's hard face twitched suddenly, as if in anger, and he gave an exclamation under his breath, so the younger man inferred that ""old Charlie"" had not spoken of their encounter.",m
5777,"And after that the Irishman once more turned a sharp, frowning glance upon his prisoner as if he were puzzled about something.",m
5778,"But, as before, he stopped short of speech and at last turned away.",m
5779,"""Just a moment!"" said the younger man.",m
5780,"He asked--  ""Is it fair to inquire how long I may expect to be confined here?",m
5781,"I don't want to presume upon your good nature too far, but if you could tell me I should be glad to know.""",m
5782,"The Irishman hesitated a moment, and then said--  ""I don't know why I shouldn't answer that.",m
5783,"It can't help you, so far as I can see, to do anything which would hinder us.",m
5784,"You'll stay until Arthur Benham comes of age, which will be in about two months from now.""",m
5785,"""Yes,"" said the other.",m
5786,"""Thanks!",m
5787,I thought so.,m
5788,"Until young Arthur comes of age and receives his patrimony, or until old David Stewart dies.",m
5789,"Of course, that might happen at any hour.""",m
5790,"The Irishman said--  ""I don't quite see what--Ah, yes, to be sure!",m
5791,"Yes, I see.",m
5792,"Well, I should count upon eight weeks, if I were you.",m
5793,"In eight weeks the boy will be independent of them all, and we shall go to England for the wedding.""",m
5794,"""The wedding?"" cried Ste.",m
5795,Marie.,m
5796,"""What wedding?--Ah!""",m
5797,"""Arthur Benham and my daughter are to be married,"" said O'Hara, ""so soon as he reaches his majority.",m
5798,"I thought you knew that.""",m
5799,In a very vague fashion he realised that he had expected it.,m
5800,"And still the definite words came to him with a shock which was like a physical blow, and he turned his back with a man's natural instinct to hide his feeling.",m
5801,Certainly that was the logical conclusion to be drawn from known premises.,m
5802,That was to be the O'Haras' reward for their labour.,m
5803,"To Stewart the great fortune, to the O'Haras a good marriage for the girl and an assured future.",m
5804,That was reward enough surely for a few weeks of angling and decoying and luring and lying.,m
5805,"That was what she had meant, on the day before, by saying that she could see all the to-morrows.",m
5806,"He realised that he must have been expecting something like this, but the thought turned him sick nevertheless.",m
5807,He could not forget the girl as he had come to know her during the past week.,m
5808,He could not face with any calmness the thought of her as the adventuress who had lured poor Arthur Benham on to destruction.,m
5809,It was an impossible thought.,m
5810,"He could have laughed at it in scornful anger, and yet--What else was she?",m
5811,"He began to realise that his action in turning his back upon the other man in the middle of a conversation must look very odd, and he faced round again trying to drive from his expression the pain and distress which he knew must be there plain to see.",m
5812,"But he need not have troubled himself, for the other man was standing before the sext window and looking out into the morning sunlight, and his hard bony face had so altered that Ste.",m
5813,Marie stared at him with open amazement.,m
5814,He thought O'Hara must be ill.,m
5815,"""I want to see her married!"" cried the Irishman suddenly.",m
5816,"And it was a new voice, a voice Ste.",m
5817,Marie did not know.,m
5818,It shook a little with an emotion that sat uncouthly upon this grim stern man.,m
5819,"""I want to see her married and safe!"" he said.",m
5820,"""I want her to be rid of this damnable, roving, cheap existence.",m
5821,"I want her to be rid of me and my rotten friends and my rotten life.""",m
5822,"He chafed his hands together before him, and his tired eyes fixed themselves upon something that he seemed to see out of the window, and glared at it fiercely.",m
5823,"""I should like,"" said he, ""to die on the day after her wedding, and so be out of her way for ever.",m
5824,I don't want her to have any shadows cast over her from the past.,m
5825,I don't want her to open closet doors and find skeletons there.,m
5826,"I want her to be free--free to live the sort of life she was born to and has a right to.""",m
5827,He turned sharply upon the younger man.,m
5828,"""You've seen her!"" he cried.",m
5829,"""You've talked to her, you know her!",m
5830,Think of that girl dragged about Europe with me ever since she was a little child!,m
5831,"Think of the people she's had to know, the things she's had to see!",m
5832,"Do you wonder that I want to have her free of it all, married and safe and comfortable and in peace?",m
5833,Do you?,m
5834,I tell you it has driven me as nearly mad as a man can be.,m
5835,But I couldn't go mad because I had to take care of her.,m
5836,"I couldn't even die because she'd have been left alone, without any one to look out for her.",m
5837,"""She wouldn't leave me!",m
5838,"I could have settled her somewhere in some quiet place where she'd have been quit at least of shady rotten people, but she wouldn't have it.",m
5839,She's stuck to me always through good times and bad.,m
5840,She's kept my heart up when I'd have been ready to cut my throat if I'd been alone.,m
5841,She's been the--bravest and faithfullest--Well I--And look at her!,m
5842,Look at her now!,m
5843,Think of what she's had to see and know--the people she's had to live with--and look at her!,m
5844,Has any of it stuck to her?,m
5845,Has it cheapened her in any littlest way?,m
5846,"No, by God!",m
5847,"She has come through it all like a--like a Sister of Charity through a city slum--like an angel through the dark!""",m
5848,"The Irishman broke off speaking, for his voice was beyond control, but after a moment he went on again more calmly--  ""This boy, this young Benham, is a fool, but he's not a mean fool.",m
5849,She'll make a man of him.,m
5850,"And, married to him, she'll have the comforts that she ought to have and the care and--freedom.",m
5851,"She'll have a chance to live the life that she had a right to, among the sort of people she has a right to know.",m
5852,I'm not afraid for her.,m
5853,She'll do her part and more.,m
5854,"She'll hold up her head among duchesses, that girl.",m
5855,"I'm not afraid for her.""",m
5856,"He said this last sentence over several times, standing before the window and staring out at the sun upon the treetops.",m
5857,"""I'm not afraid for her....",m
5858,"I'm not afraid for her.""",m
5859,"He seemed to have forgotten that the younger man was in the room, for he did not look towards him again or pay him any attention for a long while.",m
5860,"He only gazed out of the window into the fresh morning sunlight, and his face worked and quivered and his lean hands chafed restlessly together before him.",m
5861,"But at last he seemed to realise where he was, for he turned with a sudden start, and he stared at Ste.",m
5862,Marie frowning as if the younger man were some one he had never seen before.,m
5863,"He said--  ""Ah, yes, yes!",m
5864,You were wanting to go out into the garden.,m
5865,"Yes, quite so!",m
5866,I--I was thinking of something else.,m
5867,I seem to be absent-minded of late.,m
5868,"Don't let me keep you here!""",m
5869,"He seemed a little embarrassed and ill at ease, and Ste.",m
5870,"Marie said--  ""Oh, thanks!",m
5871,There's no hurry.,m
5872,"However, I'll go, I think.",m
5873,It's after eleven.,m
5874,I understand that I'm on my honour not to climb over the wall or burrow under it or batter it down.,m
5875,That's understood.,m
5876,"I----""  He felt that he ought to say something in acknowledgment of O'Hara's long speech about his daughter; but he could think of nothing to say, and besides, the Irishman seemed not to expect any comment upon his strange outburst.",m
5877,"So, in the end, Ste.",m
5878,Marie nodded and went out of the room without further ceremony.,m
5879,"He had been astonished almost beyond words at that sudden and unlooked-for breakdown of the other man's impregnable reserve, and dimly he realised that it must have come out of some very extraordinary nervous strain; but he himself had been in no state to give the Irishman's words the attention and thought that he would have given them at another time.",m
5880,"His mind, his whole field of mental vision had been full of one great fact--the girl was to be married to young Arthur Benham.",m
5881,"The thing loomed gigantic before him, and, in some strange way, terrifying.",m
5882,He could neither see nor think beyond it.,m
5883,"O'Hara's burst of confidence had reached his ears very faintly, as if from a great distance--poignant but only half comprehended words, to be reflected upon later in their own time.",m
5884,"He stumbled down the ill-lighted stair with fixed, wide, unseeing eyes, and he said one sentence over and over aloud--as the Irishman standing beside the window had said another.",m
5885,"""She is going to be married!",m
5886,"She is going to be married!""",m
5887,It would seem that he must have forgotten his previous half knowledge of the fact.,m
5888,"It would seem to have remained, as at the first hearing, a great and appalling shock--thunderous out of a blue sky.",m
5889,"Below in the open his feet led him mechanically straight down under the trees, through the tangle of shrubbery beyond, and so to the wall under the cedar.",m
5890,"Arrived there he awoke all at once to his task, and with a sort of frowning anger shook off the dream which enveloped him.",m
5891,His eyes sharpened and grew keen and eager.,m
5892,"He said--  ""The last arrow!",m
5893,"God send it reached home!""",m
5894,And so went in under the lilac shrubs.,m
5895,"He was there longer than usual: unhampered now he may have made a larger search, but when at last he emerged Ste.",m
5896,"Marie's hands were over his face, and his feet dragged slowly like an old man's feet.",m
5897,"Without knowing that he had stirred he found himself some distance away, standing still beside a chestnut tree.",m
5898,"A great wave of depression and fear and hopelessness swept him, and he shivered under it.",m
5899,"He had an instant's wild panic, and mad, desperate thoughts surged upon him.",m
5900,He saw utter failure confronting him.,m
5901,"He saw himself as helpless as a little child, his feeble efforts already spent for naught, and, like a little child, he was afraid.",m
5902,"He would have rushed at that grim encircling wall and fought his way up and over it, but even as the impulse raced to his feet the momentary madness left him and he turned away.",m
5903,He could not do a dishonourable thing even for all he held dearest.,m
5904,"He walked on in the direction which lay before him, but he took no heed of where he went; and Mlle.",m
5905,"Coira O'Hara spoke to him twice before he heard or saw her.                                                            They were near the east end of the rond point, in a space where fir trees stood and the ground underfoot was covered with dry needles.",m
5906,"""I was just on my way to--our bench beyond the fountain,"" said she, and Ste.",m
5907,"Marie nodded, looking upon her sombrely.",m
5908,"It seemed to him that he looked with new eyes, and after a little time when he did not speak but only gazed in that strange manner the girl said--  ""What is it?",m
5909,Something has happened.,m
5910,"Please tell me what it is!""",m
5911,"Something like the pale foreshadow of fear came over her beautiful face, and shrouded her golden voice as if it had been a veil.",m
5912,"""Your father,"" said Ste.",m
5913,"Marie heavily, ""has just been telling me--that you are to marry young Arthur Benham.",m
5914,"He has been telling me.""",m
5915,"She drew a quick breath, looking at him, but, after a moment, she said--  ""Yes, it is true.",m
5916,"You knew it before, though.",m
5917,Didn't you?,m
5918,Do you mean that you didn't know it before?,m
5919,I don't quite understand.,m
5920,You must have known that.,m
5921,"""What in Heaven's name did you think?"" she cried, as if with a sort of anger at his dulness.",m
5922,The man rubbed one hand wearily across his eyes.,m
5923,"""I--don't quite know,"" said he.",m
5924,"""Yes, I suppose I had thought of it.",m
5925,I don't know.,m
5926,It came to me with such a--shock!,m
5927,Yes.,m
5928,"Oh, I don't know.",m
5929,I expect I didn't think at all.,m
5930,"I--just didn't think.""",m
5931,Abruptly his eyes sharpened upon her and he moved a step forward.,m
5932,"""Tell me the truth!"" he said.",m
5933,"""Do you love this boy?""",m
5934,The girl's cheeks burned with a swift crimson and she set her lips together.,m
5935,"She was on the verge of extreme anger just then, but after a little the flush died down again and the dark fire went out of her eyes.",m
5936,She made an odd little gesture with her two hands.,m
5937,It seemed to express fatigue as much as anything--a great weariness.,m
5938,"""I like him,"" she said.",m
5939,"""I like him--enough, I suppose.",m
5940,He is good--and kind--and gentle.,m
5941,He will be good to me.,m
5942,"And I shall try very, very hard to make him happy.""",m
5943,Quite suddenly and without warning the fire of her anger burnt up again.,m
5944,She flamed defiance in the man's face.,m
5945,"""How dare you question me?"" she cried.",m
5946,"""What right have you to ask me questions about such a thing?",m
5947,"You, what you are!""",m
5948,Ste.,m
5949,Marie bent his head.,m
5950,"""No right, mademoiselle,"" said he in a low voice.",m
5951,"""I have no right to ask you anything--not even forgiveness.",m
5952,I think I am a little mad to-day.,m
5953,It--this news came to me suddenly.,m
5954,"Yes, I think I am a little mad.""",m
5955,The girl stared at him and he looked back with sombre eyes.,m
5956,Once more he was stabbed with intolerable pain to think what she was.,m
5957,Yet in an inexplicable fashion it pleased him that she should carry out her trickery to the end with a high head.,m
5958,It was a little less base done proudly.,m
5959,He could not have borne it otherwise.,m
5960,"""Who are you,"" the girl cried in a bitter resentment, ""that you should understand?",m
5961,"What do you know of the sort of life I have led--we have led together, my father and I?--Oh, I don't mean that I'm ashamed of it!",m
5962,"We have nothing to feel shame for, but you simply do not know what such a life is.""",m
5963,"Though he writhed with pain, the man nodded over her.",m
5964,"He was so glad that she could carry it through proudly, with a high hand, an erect head.",m
5965,"She spread out her arms before him, a splendid and tragic figure.",m
5966,"""What chance have I ever had?"" she demanded.",m
5967,"""No, I am not blaming him.",m
5968,I am not blaming my father!,m
5969,I chose to follow him.,m
5970,I chose it!,m
5971,But what chance have I had?,m
5972,Think of the people I have lived among!,m
5973,Would you have me marry one of them--one of those men?,m
5974,I'd rather die!,m
5975,And yet I cannot go on--forever.,m
5976,I am twenty now.,m
5977,"What if my father--You yourself said yesterday--Oh, I am afraid!",m
5978,"I tell you I have lain awake at night a hundred times and shivered with cold, terrible fear of what would become of me if--if anything should happen--to my father.",m
5979,"""And so,"" she said, ""when I met Arthur Benham last winter and he--began to--he said--when he begged me to marry him....",m
5980,"Ah, can't you see?",m
5981,It meant safety--safety--safety!,m
5982,And I liked him.,m
5983,"I like him now--very, very much.",m
5984,He is a sweet boy.,m
5985,I--shall be happy with him--in a peaceful fashion.,m
5986,"And my father----  ""Oh, I'll be honest with you,"" said she.",m
5987,"""It was my father who decided me.",m
5988,He was--he is--so pathetically pleased with it!,m
5989,He so wants me to be safe!,m
5990,It's all he lives for now.,m
5991,I--couldn't fight against them both.,m
5992,Arthur and my father.,m

5995,"She became aware that the man was staring at her with something strange and terrible in his gaze, and she broke off in wonder.",m
5996,The air of that warm summer morning turned all at once keen and sharp about them--charged with moment.,m
5997,"""Mademoiselle!"" cried Ste.",m
5998,Marie.,m
5999,"""Mademoiselle, are you telling me the truth?""",m
6000,For some obscure reason she was not angry.,m
6001,Again she spread out her hands in that gesture of weariness.,m
6002,"She said--  ""Oh, why should I lie to you?""",m
6003,And the man began to tremble exceedingly.,m
6004,He stretched out an unsteady hand.,m
6005,"""You--knew Arthur Benham last winter?"" he said.",m
6006,"""Long before his--before he left his home?",m
6007,"Before that?""",m
6008,"""He asked me to marry him last winter,"" said the girl.",m

6013,"Marie clapped his two hands over his face, and a groan came to her through the straining fingers.",m
6014,"He cried in an agony--  ""Mademoiselle! mademoiselle!""",m
6015,"He fell upon his knees at her feet, his head bent in what seemed to be an intolerable anguish, his hands over his hidden face.",m
6016,"The girl heard hard-wrung, stumbling, incoherent words, wrenched each with an effort out of extreme pain.",m
6017,"""Fool!",m
6018,"Fool!"" the man cried, groaning.",m
6019,"""Oh, fool that I have been! worm, animal!",m
6020,"Oh, fool not to see--not to know!",m
6021,"Madman; imbecile; thing without a name!""",m
6022,"She stood white-faced, smitten with great fear over this abasement.",m
6023,Not the least and faintest glimmer reached her of what it meant.,m
6024,She stretched down a hand of protest and it touched the man's head.,m
6025,As if the touch were a stroke of magic he sprang upright before her.,m
6026,"""Now at last, mademoiselle,"" said he, ""we two must speak plainly together.",m
6027,"Now at last I think I see clear, but I must know beyond doubt or question.",m
6028,"Oh, mademoiselle, now I think I know you for what you are, and it seems to me that nothing in this world is of consequence beside that.",m
6029,"I have been blind, blind, blind! ...",m
6030,Tell me one thing!,m
6031,"Why did Arthur Benham leave his home two months ago?""",m
6032,"""He had to leave it!"" she said, wondering.",m
6033,"She did not understand yet, but she was aware that her heart was beating in loud and fast throbs, and she knew that some great mystery was to be made plain before her.",m
6034,Her face was very white.,m
6035,"""He had to leave it!"" she said again.",m
6036,"""You know as well as I.  Why do you ask me that?",m
6037,He quarrelled with his grandfather.,m
6038,They had often quarrelled before--over money--always over money!,m
6039,"His grandfather is a miser, almost a madman.",m
6040,He tried to make Arthur sign a paper releasing his inheritance--the fortune he is to inherit from his father--and when Arthur wouldn't he drove him away.,m
6041,Arthur went to his uncle--Captain Stewart--and Captain Stewart helped him to hide.,m
6042,"He didn't dare go back because they're all against him, all his family.",m
6043,"They'd make him give in.""",m
6044,Ste.,m
6045,Marie gave a loud exclamation of amazement.,m
6046,The thing was incredible--childish!,m
6047,It was beyond the maddest possibilities.,m
6048,But even as he said the words to himself a face came before him--Captain Stewart's smiling and benignant face--and he understood everything.,m
6049,"As clearly as if he had been present he saw the angry bewildered boy, fresh from David Stewart's berating, mystified over some commonplace legal matter requiring a signature.",m
6050,"He saw him appeal for sympathy and counsel to ""old Charlie,"" and he heard ""old Charlie's"" reply.",m
6051,It was easy enough to understand now.,m
6052,It must have been easy enough to bring about.,m
6053,What absurdities could not such a man as Captain Stewart instil into the already prejudiced mind of that foolish lad?,m
6054,"His thoughts turned from Arthur Benham to the girl before him, and that part of the mystery was clear also.",m
6055,She would believe whatever she was told in the absence of any reason to doubt.,m
6056,What did she know of old David Stewart or of the Benham family?,m
6057,It seemed to Ste.,m
6058,Marie all at once incredible that he could ever have believed ill of her--ever have doubted her honesty.,m
6059,It seemed to him so incredible that he could have laughed aloud in bitterness and self-disdain.,m
6060,"But as he looked at the girl's white face and her shadowy, wondering eyes all laughter, all bitterness, all cruel misunderstandings were swallowed up in the golden light of his joy at knowing her, in the end, for what she was.",m
6061,"""Coira!",m
6062,"Coira!"" he cried, and neither of the two knew that he called her for the first time by her name.",m
6063,"""Oh, child,"" said he, ""how they have lied to you and tricked you!",m
6064,"I might have known, I might have seen it, but I was a blind fool.",m
6065,I thought--intolerable things.,m
6066,I might have known!,m
6067,"They have lied to you most damnably, Coira.""",m
6068,She stared at him in a breathless silence without movement of any sort.,m
6069,"Only her face seemed to have turned a little whiter, and her great eyes darker so that they looked almost black, and enormous in that still face.",m
6070,"He told her, briefly, the truth, how young Arthur had had frequent quarrels with his grandfather over his waste of money, how after one of them, not at all unlike the others, he had disappeared, and how Captain Stewart, in desperate need, had set afoot his plot to get the lad's greater inheritance for himself.",m
6071,"He described for her old David Stewart and the man's bitter grief, and he told her about the will, about how he had begun to suspect Captain Stewart and of how he had traced the lost boy to La Lierre.",m
6072,"He told her all that he knew of the whole matter and he knew almost all there was to know, and he did not spare himself even his misconception of the part she had played, though he softened that as best he could.",m
6073,Midway of his story Mlle.,m
6074,O'Hara bent her head and covered her face with her hands.,m
6075,She did not cry out or protest or speak at all.,m
6076,"She made no more than that one movement, and after it she stood quite still, but the sight of her, bowed and shamed, stripped of pride, as it had been of garments, was more than the man could bear.",m
6077,"He cried her name--  ""Coira!""",m
6078,"And when she did not look up, he called once more upon her.",m
6079,"He said--  ""Coira, I cannot bear to see you stand so!",m
6080,Look at me!,m
6081,"Ah, child, look at me!",m
6082,"""Can you realise,"" he cried, ""can you even begin to think what a great joy it is to me to know at last that you have had no part in all this?",m
6083,Can't you see what it means to me?,m
6084,I can think of nothing else.,m
6085,"Coira, look up!""",m
6086,"She raised her white face and there were no tears upon it, but a still anguish too great to be told.",m
6087,It would seem never to have occurred to her to doubt the truth of his words.,m
6088,"She said--  ""It is I who might have known.",m
6089,Knowing what you have told me now it seems impossible that I could have believed.--And Captain Stewart--I always hated him--loathed him--distrusted him.,m
6090,"""And yet,"" she cried, wringing her hands, ""how could I know?",m
6091,"How could I know?""",m
6092,The girl's face writhed suddenly with her grief and she stared up at Ste.,m
6093,Marie with terror in her eyes.,m
6094,"She whispered--  ""My father!",m
6095,"Oh, Ste.",m
6096,"Marie, my father!",m
6097,It is not possible.,m
6098,"I will not believe--He cannot have done this, knowing.",m
6099,"My father, Ste.",m
6100,"Marie!""",m
6101,"The man turned his eyes away, and she gave a sobbing cry.",m
6102,"""Has he,"" she said slowly, ""done even this for me?",m
6103,Has he given--his honour also--when everything else was--gone?,m
6104,Has he given me his honour too?,m
6105,"""Oh!"" she said, ""why could I not have died when I was a little child?",m
6106,Why could I not have done that?,m
6107,To think that I should have lived to--bring my father to this!,m
6108,I wish I had died.,m
6109,"""Ste.",m
6110,"Marie!"" she said, pleading with him.",m
6111,"""Ste.",m
6112,"Marie, do you think--my father--knew?""",m
6113,"""Let me think!"" said he.",m
6114,"""Let me think!",m
6115,Is it possible that Stewart has lied to you all--to one as to another?,m
6116,"Let me think!""",m
6117,His mind ran back over the matter and he began to remember instances which had seemed to him odd but to which he had attached no importance.,m
6118,"He remembered O'Hara's puzzled and uncomprehending face when he, Ste.",m
6119,"Marie, had spoken of Stewart's villainy.",m
6120,"He remembered the man's indignation over the affair of the poison, and his fairness in trying to make amends.",m
6121,"He remembered other things, and his face grew lighter and he drew a great breath of relief.",m
6122,"He said--  ""Coira, I do not believe he knew.",m
6123,"Stewart has lied equally to you all--tricked each one of you!""",m
6124,"And at that the girl gave a cry of gladness, and began to weep.",m
6125,"As long as men and women continue to stand upon opposite sides of a great gulf--and that will be as long as they exist together in this world--just so long will men continue to be unhappy and ill at ease in the face of women's tears, even though they know vaguely that tears may mean just anything at all, and by no means always grief.",m
6126,Ste.,m
6127,Marie stood first upon one foot and then upon the other.,m
6128,He looked anxiously about him for succour.,m
6129,"He said: ""There! there!"" or words to that effect, and once he touched the shoulder of the girl who stood weeping before him, and he was very miserable indeed.",m
6130,"But quite suddenly, in the midst of his discomfort, she looked up to him, and she was smiling and flushed, so that Ste.",m
6131,Marie stared at her in utter amazement.,m
6132,"""So now at last,"" said she, ""I have back my Bayard.",m
6133,"And I think the rest--doesn't matter very much.""",m
6134,"""Bayard?"" said he, wondering.",m
6135,"""I don't understand,"" he said.",m
6136,"""Then,"" said she, ""you must just go without understanding.",m
6137,"For I shall never, never explain.""",m
6138,The bright flush went from her face and she turned grave once more.,m
6139,"""What is to be done?"" she asked.",m
6140,"""What must we do now, Ste.",m
6141,Marie?--I mean about Arthur Benham.,m
6142,"I suppose he must be told.""",m
6143,"""Either he must be told,"" said the man, ""or he must be taken back to his home by force.""",m
6144,He told her about the four letters which in four days he had thrown over the wall into the Clamart road.,m
6145,"""It was on the chance,"" he said, ""that some one would pick one of them up and post it, thinking it had been dropped there by accident.",m
6146,What has become of them I don't know.,m
6147,"I know only that they never reached Hartley.""",m
6148,The girl nodded thoughtfully.,m
6149,"""Yes,"" said she, ""that was the best thing you could have done.",m
6150,It ought to have succeeded.,m
6151,"Of course----""  She paused a moment and then nodded again.",m
6152,"""Of course,"" said she, ""I can manage to get a letter in the post now.",m
6153,We'll send it to-day if you like.,m
6154,But I was wondering--Would it be better or not to tell Arthur the truth?,m
6155,It all depends upon how he may take it--whether or not he will believe you.,m
6156,"He's very stubborn, and he's frightened about this break with his family, and he is quite sure that he has been badly treated.",m
6157,Will he believe you?,m
6158,Of course if he does believe he could escape from here quite easily at any time and there'd be no necessity for a rescue.,m
6159,"What do you think?""",m
6160,"""I think he ought to be told,"" said Ste.",m
6161,Marie.,m
6162,"""If we try to carry him away by force there'll be a fight, of course, and--who knows what might happen?",m
6163,That we must leave for a last resort--a last desperate resort.,m
6164,"First we must tell the boy.""",m
6165,"Abruptly he gave a cry of dismay, and the girl looked up to him, staring.",m
6166,"""But--but you, Coira!"" said he, stammering.",m
6167,"""But you!",m
6168,"I hadn't realised--I hadn't thought--it never occurred to me what this means to you.""",m
6169,The full enormity of the thing came upon him slowly.,m
6170,He was asking this girl to help him in robbing her of her lover.,m
6171,She shook her head with a little wry smile.,m
6172,"""Do you think,"" said she, ""that knowing what I know now I would go on with that until after he has made his peace with his family?",m
6173,"Before, it was different.",m
6174,I thought him alone and ill-treated and hunted down.,m
6175,"I could help him then, comfort him.",m
6176,"Now I should be--all you ever thought me, if I did not send him to his grandfather.""",m
6177,"She smiled again, a little mirthlessly.",m
6178,"""If his love for me is worth anything,"" she said, ""he will come back--but openly, this time, not in hiding.",m
6179,Then I shall know that he is--what I would have him be.,m
6180,"Otherwise----""  Ste.",m
6181,Marie looked away.,m
6182,"""But you must remember, Coira,"" said he, ""that the lad is very young, and that his family--They may try--It may be hard for him.",m
6183,"They may say that he is too young to know--Ah, child, I should have thought of this!""",m
6184,"""Ste.",m
6185,"Marie!"" said the girl, and after a moment he turned to face her.",m
6186,"""What will you say to Arthur's family, Ste.",m
6187,"Marie,"" she demanded very soberly, ""when they ask you if I--if Arthur should be allowed to--come back to me?""",m
6188,A wave of colour flooded the man's face and his eyes shone.,m
6189,"He cried--  ""I shall tell them, Coira, that if that wretched half-baked lad should search this wide world round, from Paris on to Paris again, and if he should spend a lifetime searching, he would never find the beauty and the sweetness and the tenderness and the true faith that he left behind at La Lierre--nor the hundredth part of them.",m
6190,"I should say that you are so much above him that he ought to creep to you on his knees from the Rue de l'Universite to this garden, thanking God that you were here at the journey's end, and kissing the ground that he dragged himself over for sheer joy and gratitude.",m
6191,"I should tell them--Oh, I have no words!",m
6192,I could tell them so pitifully little of you!,m
6193,I think I should only say: 'Go to her and see!',m
6194,"I think I should just say that.""",m
6195,"The girl turned her head away with a little sob, but afterwards she faced him once more, and she looked up to him with sweet, half-shut eyes for a long time.",m
6196,"At last she said--  ""For love of whom, Ste.",m
6197,"Marie, did you undertake this quest--this search for Arthur Benham?",m
6198,It was not in idleness or by way of a whim.,m
6199,It was for love.,m
6200,"For love of whom?""",m
6201,"For some strange and inexplicable reason the words struck him like a blow, and he stared whitely.",m
6202,"""I came,"" he said at last, and his voice was oddly flat, ""for his sister's sake.",m
6203,"For love of her.""",m
6204,Coira O'Hara dropped her eyes.,m
6205,But presently she looked up again with a smile.,m
6206,"She said--  ""God make you happy, my friend!""",m
6207,And she turned and moved away from him up among the trees.,m
6208,"At a little distance she turned, saying--  ""Wait where you are!",m
6209,I will fetch Arthur or send him to you.,m
6210,"He must be told at once.""",m
6211,Then she went on and was lost to sight.,m
6212,Ste.,m
6213,Marie followed a few steps after her and halted.,m
6214,"His face was turned, by chance, towards the east wall, and suddenly he gave a great cry and smothered it with his hands over his mouth.",m
6215,His knees bent under him and he was weak and trembling.,m
6216,Then he began to run.,m
6217,"He ran with awkward steps for his leg was not yet entirely recovered, but he ran fast, and his heart beat within him until he thought it must burst.",m
6218,He was making for that spot which was overhung by the half dead cedar tree.                                                                   Ste.,m
6219,Marie came under the wall breathless and shaking.,m
6220,"What he had seen there from a distance was no longer visible, but he pressed in close among the lilac shrubs and called out in an unsteady voice.",m
6221,"He said--  ""Who is there?",m
6222,"Who is it?""",m
6223,And after a moment he called again.,m
6224,A hand appeared at the top of the high wall.,m
6225,"The drooping screen of foliage was thrust aside, and he saw Richard Hartley's face looking down.",m
6226,Ste.,m
6227,"Marie held himself by the strong stems of the lilacs, for once more his knees had weakened under him.",m
6228,"""There's no one in sight,"" Hartley said.",m
6229,"""I can see for a long way.",m
6230,"No one can see us or hear us.""",m
6231,"And he said: ""I got your letter this morning--an hour ago.",m
6232,When shall we come to get you out--you and the boy?,m
6233,"To-night?""",m
6234,"""To-night at two!"" said Ste.",m
6235,Marie.,m
6236,He spoke in a loud whisper.,m
6237,"""I'm to talk with Arthur here in a few minutes.",m
6238,We must be quick.,m
6239,He may come at any time.,m
6240,"I shall try to persuade him to go home willingly, but if he refuses we must take him by force.",m
6241,Bring a couple of good men with you to-night and see that they're armed.,m
6242,Come in a motor and leave it just outside the wall by that small door that you passed.,m
6243,Have you any money in your pockets?,m
6244,"I may want to bribe the gardener.""",m
6245,"Hartley searched in his pockets, and while he did so the man beneath asked--  ""Is old David Stewart alive?""",m
6246,"""Just about!""",m
6247,Hartley said.,m
6248,"""He's very low and he suffers a great deal, but he's quite conscious all the time.",m
6249,If we can fetch the boy to him it may give him a turn for the better.,m
6250,Where is Captain Stewart?,m
6251,I had spies on his trail for some time but he has disappeared within the past three or four days.,m
6252,"Once I followed him in his motor out past here, but I lost him beyond Clamart.""",m
6253,"""He's here, I think,"" said Ste.",m
6254,Marie.,m
6255,"""I saw him a few days ago.""",m
6256,"The man on the wall had found two notes of a hundred francs each, and he dropped them down to Ste.",m
6257,Marie's hands.,m
6258,"Also he gave him a small revolver which he had in his pocket, one of the little automatic weapons such as Olga Nilssen had brought to the Rue du Faubourg St.",m
6259,Honore.,m
6260,"Afterwards he glanced up and said--  ""Two people are coming out of the house, I shall have to go.",m
6261,"At two to-night, then!--and at this spot.",m
6262,"We shall be in time.""",m
6263,"He drew back out of sight, and the other man heard the cedar-tree shake slightly as he went down to the ground.",m
6264,Then Ste.,m
6265,Marie turned and walked quickly back to the place where Mlle.,m
6266,O'Hara had left him.,m
6267,"His heart was leaping with joy and exultation, for now at last he thought that the end was in sight--the end he had so long laboured and hoped for.",m
6268,"He knew that his face must be flushed and his eyes bright, and he made a strong effort to crush down these tokens of his triumph--to make his bearing seem natural and easy.",m
6269,He might have spared himself the pains.,m
6270,Young Arthur Benham and Coira O'Hara came together down under the trees from the house.,m
6271,"They walked swiftly, and the boy was a step in advance, his face white with excitement and anger.",m
6272,He began to speak while he was still some distance away.,m
6273,"He cried out in his strident young voice--  ""What the devil is all this silly nonsense about old Charlie and lies and misunderstandings and--and all that guff?"" he demanded.",m
6274,"""What the devil is it?",m
6275,D'you think I'm a fool?,m
6276,D'you think I'm a kid?,m
6277,"Well, I'm not!""",m
6278,He came close to Ste.,m
6279,"Marie, staring at him with an angry scowl, but the scowl twitched and wavered, and his hands shook a little beside him, and his breath came irregularly.",m
6280,He was frightened.,m
6281,"""There is no nonsense,"" said Ste.",m
6282,Marie.,m
6283,"""There is no nonsense in all this whole sorry business.",m
6284,But there has been a great deal of misunderstanding and a great many lies and not a little cruelty.,m
6285,"It's time you knew the truth at last.""",m
6286,He turned his eyes to where Coira O'Hara stood near-by.,m
6287,"""How much have you told him?"" he asked.",m
6288,"And the girl said--  ""I told him everything, or almost.",m
6289,But I had to say it very quickly and--he wouldn't believe me.,m
6290,"I think you'd best tell him again.""",m
6291,The boy gave a short contemptuous laugh.,m
6292,"""Well, I don't want to hear it,"" said he.",m
6293,He was looking towards the girl.,m
6294,"He said--  ""This fellow may be able to hypnotize you, all right, but not Willie.",m
6295,"Little Willie's wise to guys like him.""",m
6296,And swinging about to Ste.,m
6297,"Marie, he cried--  ""Forget it!",m
6298,Forget it!,m

6306,Ste.,m
6307,"Marie frowned, for his temper was never of the most patient, and the youth's sneering tone annoyed him.",m
6308,"Truth to tell the tone was about all he understood, for the strange words were incomprehensible.",m
6309,"""Look here, Benham!"" he said sharply.",m
6310,"""You and I have never met, I believe, but we have a good many friends in common, and I think we know something about each other.",m
6311,Have you ever heard anything about me which would give you the right to suspect me of any dishonesty of any sort?,m
6312,"Have you?""",m
6313,"""Oh, slush!"" said the boy.",m
6314,"""Anybody 'll be dishonest if it's worth his while.""",m
6315,"""That happens to be untrue,"" Ste.",m
6316,"Marie remarked, ""and as you grow older you will know it.",m
6317,"Leaving my honesty out of the question if you like, I have the honour to tell you that I am, perhaps not quite formally, engaged to your sister, and it is on her account, for her sake, that I am here.",m
6318,"You will hardly presume, I take it, to question your sister's motive in wanting you to return home?",m
6319,Incidentally your grandfather is so overcome by grief over your absence that he is expected to die at any time.,m
6320,"""Come!"" said he, ""I have said enough to convince you that you must listen to me.",m
6321,"Believe what you please, but listen to me for five minutes!",m

6344,"""I don't care.",m
6345,I don't have to listen.,m
6346,"Talk, if you're pining for it.""",m
6347,And Ste.,m
6348,"Marie, as briefly as he could, told him the truth of the whole affair from the beginning, as he had told it to Coira O'Hara.",m
6349,"Only, he laid special stress upon Charles Stewart's present expectations from the new will; and he assured the boy that no document his grandfather might have asked him to sign could have given away his rights in his father's fortune since he was a minor, and had no legal right to sign away anything at all even if he wished to.",m
6350,"""If you will look back as calmly and carefully as you can,"" he said, ""you will find that you didn't begin to suspect your grandfather of anything wrong until you had talked with Captain Stewart.",m
6351,It was your uncle's explanation of the thing that made you do that.,m
6352,"Well, remember what he had at stake--I suppose it is a matter of several millions of francs.",m
6353,And he needs them.,m
6354,"His affairs are in a bad way.""",m
6355,"He told also about the pretended search which Captain Stewart had so long maintained, and of how he had tried to mislead the other searchers whose motives were honest.",m
6356,"""It has been a gigantic gamble, my friend,"" he said at the last.",m
6357,"""A gigantic and desperate gamble to get the money that should be yours.",m
6358,"You can end it by the mere trouble of climbing over that wall yonder, and taking the Clamart tram back to Paris.",m
6359,"As easily as that you can end it--and, if I am not mistaken, you can at the same time save an old man's life--prolong it at the very least.""",m
6360,He took a step forwards.,m
6361,"""I beg you to go!"" he said very earnestly.",m
6362,"""You know the whole truth now.",m
6363,You must see what danger you have been and are in.,m
6364,You must know that I am telling you the truth.,m
6365,"I beg you to go back to Paris.""",m
6366,"And from where she stood, a little aside, Coira O'Hara said--  ""I beg you too, Arthur.",m
6367,"Go back to them!""",m
6368,"The boy dropped down upon a tree stump which was near, and covered his face with his hands.",m
6369,The two who watched him could see that he was trembling violently.,m
6370,"Over him their eyes met and they questioned each other with a mute and anxious gravity--  ""What will he do?""",m
6371,For everything was in Arthur Benham's weak hands now.,m
6372,"For a little time, which seemed hours to all who were there, the lad sat still hiding his face, but suddenly he sprang to his feet and once more stood staring into Ste.",m
6373,Marie's quiet eyes.,m
6374,"""How do I know you're telling the truth?"" he cried, and his voice ran up high and shrill, and wavered and broke.",m
6375,"""How do I know that?",m
6376,"You'd tell just as smooth a story if--if you were lying--if you'd been sent here to get me back to--to what old Charlie said they wanted me for.""",m
6377,"""You have only to go back to them and make sure,"" said Ste.",m
6378,Marie.,m
6379,"""They can't harm you or take anything from you.",m
6380,If they persuaded you to sign anything--which they will not do--it would be valueless to them because you're a minor.,m
6381,You know that as well as I do.,m
6382,Go and make sure!,m
6383,"""Or wait! wait!""",m
6384,He gave a little sharp laugh of excitement.,m
6385,"""Is Captain Stewart in the house?"" he demanded.",m
6386,"""Call him out here!",m
6387,That's better still!,m
6388,"Bring your uncle here to face me without telling him what it's for, without giving him time to make up a story!",m
6389,Then we shall see.,m
6390,"Send for him!""",m
6391,"""He's not here,"" said the boy.",m
6392,"""He went away an hour ago.",m
6393,"I don't know whether he'll be back to-night or not.""",m
6394,"Young Arthur stared at the elder man, breathing hard.",m
6395,"""Good God!"" he said in a whisper, ""if--old Charlie is rotten, who in this world isn't?",m
6396,"I--don't know what to believe.""",m
6397,Abruptly he turned with a sort of snarl upon Coira O'Hara.,m
6398,"""Have you been in this game too?"" he cried out.",m
6399,"""I suppose you and your precious father and old Charlie cooked it up together!",m
6400,What?,m
6401,"You've been having a fine low-comedy time laughing yourselves to death at me, haven't you!",m
6402,"O Lord, what a gang!""",m
6403,Ste.,m
6404,Marie caught the boy by the shoulder and spun him round.,m
6405,"""That will do!"" he said sternly.",m
6406,"""You have been a fool; don't make it worse by being a coward and a cad.",m
6407,Mlle.,m
6408,O'Hara knew no more of the truth than you knew.,m
6409,"Your uncle lied to you all.""",m
6410,But the girl came and touched his arm.,m
6411,"She said--  ""Don't be hard with him!",m
6412,"He is bewildered and nervous, and he doesn't know what he is saying.",m
6413,Think how sudden it has been for him.,m
6414,"Don't be hard with him, M. Ste.",m
6415,"Marie.""",m
6416,Ste.,m
6417,"Marie dropped his hand, and the lad backed a few steps away.",m
6418,His face was crimson.,m
6419,"After a moment he said--  ""I'm sorry, Coira.",m
6420,I didn't mean that.,m
6421,I didn't mean it.,m
6422,I beg your pardon.,m
6423,"I'm about half dippy, I guess.",m
6424,"I--don't know what to believe or what to think or what to do.""",m
6425,"He remained staring at her a little while in silence, and presently his eyes sharpened.",m
6426,"He cried out--  ""If I should go back there (mind you, I say, 'if'!) d'you know what they'd do?",m
6427,"Well, I'll tell you.",m
6428,They'd begin to talk at me one at a time.,m
6429,"They'd get me in a corner and cry over me and say I was young and didn't know my mind, and that I owed them something for all that's happened, and not to bring their grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.",m
6430,"And the long and short of it would be that they'd make me give you up.""",m
6431,He wheeled upon Ste.,m
6432,Marie.,m
6433,"""That's what they'd do!"" he said, and his voice began to rise again shrilly.",m
6434,"""They're three to one, and they know they can talk me into anything.",m
6435,"You know it too.""",m
6436,He shook his head.,m
6437,"""I won't go back!"" he cried wildly.",m
6438,"""That's what will happen if I do.",m
6439,I don't want granddad's money.,m
6440,He can give it to old Charlie or to a gendarme if he wants to.,m
6441,I'm going to have enough of my own.,m
6442,"I won't go back, and that's all there is of it.",m
6443,"You may be telling the truth or you may not, but I won't go.""",m
6444,Ste.,m
6445,"Marie started to speak, but the girl checked him.",m
6446,"She moved closer to where Arthur Benham stood, and she said--  ""If your love for me, Arthur, is worth having, it is worth fighting for.",m
6447,"If it is so weak that your family can persuade you out of it, then--I don't want it at all, for it would never last.",m
6448,"Arthur, you must go back to them.",m
6449,"I want you to go.""",m
6450,"""I won't!"" the boy cried.",m
6451,"""I won't go.",m
6452,I tell you they could talk me out of anything.,m
6453,You don't know 'em.,m
6454,I do.,m
6455,I can't stand against them.,m
6456,"I won't go, and that settles it.",m
6457,"Besides, I'm not so sure that this fellow's telling the truth.",m
6458,"I've known old Charlie a lot longer than I have him.""",m
6459,Coira O'Hara turned a despairing face over her shoulder towards Ste.,m
6460,Marie.,m
6461,"""Leave me alone with him!"" she begged.",m
6462,"""Perhaps I can win him over.",m
6463,"Leave us alone for a little while!""",m
6464,Ste.,m
6465,"Marie hesitated, and in the end went away and left the two together.",m
6466,He went farther down the park to the rond point and crossed it to the familiar stone bench at the west side.,m
6467,He sat down there to wait.,m
6468,"He was anxious and alarmed over this new obstacle, for he had the wit to see that it was a very important one.",m
6469,"It was quite conceivable that the boy, but half convinced, half yielding before, would balk altogether when he realised, as evidently he did realise, what returning home might mean to him--the loss of the girl he hoped to marry.",m
6470,Ste.,m
6471,Marie was sufficiently wise in worldly matters to know that the boy's fear was not unfounded.,m
6472,He could imagine the family in the Rue de l'Universite taking exactly the view young Arthur said they would take towards an alliance with the daughter of a notorious Irish adventurer.,m
6473,Ste.,m
6474,"Marie's cheeks burned hotly with anger when the words said themselves in his brain, but he knew that there could be no doubt of the Benhams' and even of old David Stewart's view of the affair.",m
6475,They would oppose the marriage with all their strength.,m
6476,"He tried to imagine what weight such considerations would have with him if it were he who was to marry Coira O'Hara, and he laughed aloud with scorn of them and with great pride in her.",m
6477,But the lad yonder was very young (too young: his family would be right to that extent).,m
6478,Would he be able to stand against them?,m
6479,Ste.,m
6480,"Marie shook his head with a sigh and gave over unprofitable wonderings, for he was still within the walls of La Lierre, and so was Arthur Benham.",m
6481,And the walls were high and strong.,m
6482,"He fell to thinking of the attempt at rescue which was to be made that night, and he began to form plans and think of necessary preparations.",m
6483,"To be sure Coira might persuade the boy to escape during the day, and then the night attack would be unnecessary; but in case of her failure it must be prepared for.",m
6484,"He rose to his feet and began to walk back and forth under the rows of chestnut trees, where the earth was firm and black and mossy and there was no growth of shrubbery.",m
6485,He thought of that hasty interview with Richard Hartley and he laughed a little.,m
6486,It had been rather like an exchange of telegrams--reduced to the bare bones of necessary question and answer.,m
6487,There had been no time for conversation.,m
6488,"His eyes caught a far-off glimpse of woman's garments, and he saw that Coira O'Hara and Arthur Benham were walking towards the house.",m
6489,So he went a little way after them and waited at a point where he could see any one returning.,m
6490,"He had not long to wait, for it seemed that the girl went only as far as the door with her fiance and then turned back.",m
6491,Ste.,m
6492,"Marie met her with raised eyebrows, and she shook her head.",m
6493,"""I don't know,"" said she.",m
6494,"""He is very stubborn.",m
6495,He is frightened and bewildered.,m
6496,"As he said, a while ago, he doesn't know what to think or what to believe.",m
6497,You mustn't blame him.,m
6498,Remember how he trusted his uncle!,m
6499,"He's going to think it over, and I shall see him again this afternoon.",m
6500,Perhaps when he has had time to reflect----  I don't know.,m
6501,"I truly don't know.""",m
6502,"""He won't go to your father and make a scene?"" said Ste.",m
6503,"Marie, and the girl shook her head.",m
6504,"""I made him promise not to.""",m
6505,"""Oh, Bayard,"" she cried--and in his abstraction he did not notice the name she gave him--""I am afraid, myself!",m
6506,"I am horribly afraid about my father.""",m
6507,"""I am sure he did not know,"" said the man.",m
6508,"""Stewart lied to him.""",m
6509,"But Coira O'Hara shook her head, saying--  ""I didn't mean that.",m
6510,"I'm afraid of what will happen when he finds out how he has been--how we have been played upon, tricked, deceived--what a light we have been placed in.",m
6511,"You don't know, you can't even imagine, how he has set his heart on--what he wished to occur.",m
6512,I am afraid he will do something terrible when he knows.,m
6513,"I am afraid he will kill Captain Stewart.""",m
6514,"""Which,"" observed Ste.",m
6515,"Marie, ""would be an excellent solution of the problem.",m
6516,"But, of course, we mustn't let it happen.",m
6517,"What can be done?""",m
6518,"""We mustn't let him know the truth,"" said the girl, ""until Arthur is gone, and until Captain Stewart is gone too.",m
6519,He is terrible when he's angry.,m
6520,We must keep the truth from him until he can do no harm.,m
6521,"It will be bad enough even then, for I think it will break his heart.""",m
6522,Ste.,m
6523,"Marie remembered that there was something she did not know, and he told her about his interview with Richard Hartley, and about their arrangement for the rescue--if it should be necessary--on that very night.",m
6524,"She nodded her head over it, but for a long time after he had finished she did not speak.",m
6525,"Then she said--  ""I am glad, I suppose.",m
6526,"Yes, since it has to be done I suppose I am glad that it is to come at once.""",m
6527,She looked up at Ste.,m
6528,Marie with shadowy inscrutable eyes.,m
6529,"""And so, monsieur,"" said she, ""it is at an end--all this.""",m
6530,She made a little gesture which seemed to sweep the park and gardens.,m
6531,"""So we go out of each other's lives as abruptly as we entered them.",m
6532,"Well----""  She had continued to look at him, but she saw the man's face turn white, and she saw something come into his eyes which was like intolerable pain.",m
6533,Then she looked away.,m
6534,Ste.,m
6535,"Marie said her name twice, under his breath, in a sort of soundless cry, but he said no more, and after a moment she went on--  ""Even so, I am glad that at last we know each other--for what we are....",m
6536,I should have been sorry to go on thinking you ... what I thought before....,m
6537,"And I could not have borne it, I'm afraid, to have you think ... what you thought of me ... when I came to know....",m
6538,"I'm glad we understand at last.""",m
6539,Ste.,m
6540,"Marie tried to speak, but no words would come to him.",m
6541,"He was like a man defeated and crushed, not one on the highroad to victory.",m
6542,But it may have been that the look of him was more eloquent than anything he could have said.,m
6543,And it may have been that the girl saw and understood.,m
6544,"So the two remained there for a little while longer in silence, but at last Coira O'Hara said--  ""I must go back to the house now.",m
6545,"There is nothing more to be done, I suppose--nothing left now but to wait for night to come.",m
6546,I shall see Arthur this afternoon and make one last appeal to him.,m
6547,If that fails you must carry him off.,m
6548,Do you know where he sleeps?,m
6549,It is the room corresponding to yours on the other side of the house--just across that wide landing at the top of the stairs.,m
6550,I will manage that the front door below shall be left unlocked.,m
6551,The rest you and your friends must do.,m
6552,"If I can make any impression upon Arthur, I'll slip a note under your door this afternoon or this evening.",m
6553,Perhaps even if he decides to go it would be best for him to wait until night and go with the rest of you.,m
6554,"In any case I'll let you know.""",m
6555,"She spoke rapidly, as if she were in great haste to be gone, and with averted eyes.",m
6556,"And at the end she turned away without any word of farewell, but Ste.",m
6557,Marie started after her.,m
6558,"He cried--  ""Coira!",m
6559,"Coira!""",m
6560,"And, when she stopped, he said--  ""Coira, I can't let you go like this!",m
6561,"Are we to--simply to go our different ways, like this, as if we'd never met at all?""",m
6562,"""What else?"" said the girl.",m
6563,And there was no answer to that.,m
6564,Their separate ways were determined for them--marked plain to see.,m
6565,"""But afterwards!"" he cried.",m
6566,"""Afterwards--after we have got the boy back to his home!",m
6567,"What then?""",m
6568,"""Perhaps,"" she said, ""he will return to me.""",m
6569,She spoke without any show of feeling.,m
6570,"""Perhaps he will return.",m
6571,"If not--well, I don't know.",m
6572,I expect my father and I will just go on as we've always gone.,m
6573,"We're used to it, you know.""",m
6574,After that she nodded to him and once more turned away.,m
6575,"Her face may have been a very little pale, but, as before, it betrayed no feeling of any sort.",m
6576,"So she went up under the trees to the house, and Ste.",m
6577,Marie watched her with strained and burning eyes.,m
6578,"When, half an hour later, he followed, he came unexpectedly upon the old Michel, who had entered the park through the little wooden door in the wall, and was on his way round to the kitchen with sundry parcels of supplies.",m
6579,"He spoke a civil ""bon jour, monsieur,"" and Ste.",m
6580,Marie stopped him.,m
6581,They were out of sight from the windows.,m
6582,Ste.,m
6583,"Marie withdrew from his pocket one of the hundred-franc notes, and the single bead-like eye of the ancient gnome fixed upon it and seemed to shiver with a fascinated delight.",m
6584,"""A hundred francs!"" said Ste.",m
6585,"Marie unnecessarily, and the old man licked his withered lips.",m
6586,"The tempter said--  ""My good Michel, would you care to receive this trifling sum? a hundred francs?""",m
6587,The gnome made a choked croaking sound in his throat.,m
6588,"""It is yours,"" said Ste.",m
6589,"Marie, ""for a small service--for doing nothing at all.""",m
6590,The bead-like eye rose to his and sharpened intelligently.,m
6591,"""I desire only,"" said he, ""that you should sleep well to-night, very well--without waking.""",m
6592,"""Monsieur,"" said the old man, ""I do not sleep at all.",m
6593,I watch.,m
6594,I watch monsieur's windows.,m
6595,"Monsieur O'ara watches until midnight, and I watch from then until day.""",m
6596,"""Oh, I know that,"" said the other.",m
6597,"""I've seen you more than once in the moonlight, but to-night, mon vieux, slumber will overcome you.",m
6598,Exhaustion will have its way and you will sleep.,m
6599,"You will sleep like the dead.""",m
6600,"""I dare not!"" cried the gardener.",m
6601,"""Monsieur, I dare not!",m
6602,The old one would kill me.,m
6603,You do not know him.,m
6604,He would cut me into pieces and burn the pieces.,m
6605,"Monsieur, it is impossible.""",m
6606,Ste.,m
6607,Marie withdrew the other hundred franc note and held the two together in his hand.,m
6608,"Once more the gnome made his strange croaking sound, and the withered face twisted with anguish.",m
6609,"""Monsieur! monsieur!"" he groaned.",m
6610,"""I have an idea,"" said the tempter.",m
6611,"""A little earth rubbed upon one side of the head--perhaps a trifling scratch to show a few drops of blood.",m
6612,"You have been assaulted, beaten down despite a heroic resistance and left for dead.",m
6613,An hour afterwards you stagger into the house a frightful object.,m
6614,"Hein?""",m
6615,The withered face of the old man expanded slowly into a senile grin.,m
6616,"""Monsieur,"" said he with admiration in his tone, ""it is magnificent.",m
6617,It shall be done.,m
6618,"I sleep like the good dead--under the trees, not too near the lilacs, eh?",m
6619,"Bien, monsieur, it is done!""",m
6620,"Into his trembling claw he took the notes, he made an odd bow, and shambled away about his business.",m
6621,Ste.,m
6622,Marie laughed and went on into the house.,m
6623,He counted and there were fourteen hours to wait.,m
6624,"Fourteen hours, and at the end of them--what?",m
6625,His blood began to warm to the night's work.                                                                 The fourteen long hours dragged themselves by.,m
6626,"They seemed interminable, but somehow they passed and the appointed time drew near.",m
6627,Ste.,m
6628,"Marie spent the greater part of the afternoon reading, but twice he lay down upon the bed and tried to sleep, and once he actually dozed off for a brief space.",m
6629,The old Michel brought his meals.,m
6630,"He had thought it possible that Coira might manage to bring the dinner-tray, as she had already done on several occasions, and so make an opportunity for informing him as to young Arthur's state of mind.",m
6631,But she did not come and no word came from her.,m
6632,So evening drew on and the dusk gathered and deepened into darkness.,m
6633,Ste.,m
6634,Marie walked his floor and prayed for the hours to pass.,m
6635,"He had candles and matches, and there was even a lamp in the room so that he could have read if he chose, but he knew that the words would have been meaningless to him, that he was incapable of abstracting his thought from the night's stern work.",m
6636,He began to be anxious over not having heard from Mlle.,m
6637,O'Hara.,m
6638,"She had said that she would talk with Arthur Benham during the afternoon, and then slip a note under Ste.",m
6639,Marie's door.,m
6640,"Yet no word had come from her, and, to the man pacing his floor in the darkness, the fact took on proportions tremendous and fantastic.",m
6641,Something had happened.,m
6642,"The boy had broken his promise, burst out upon O'Hara, or more probably upon his uncle, and the house was by the ears.",m
6643,Coira was watched--even locked in her room.,m
6644,Stewart had fled!,m
6645,A score of such terrible possibilities rushed through Ste.,m
6646,Marie's brain and tortured him.,m
6647,"He was in a state of nervous tension that was almost unendurable, and the little noises of the night outside, a wind-stirred rustle of leaves, a bird's flutter among the branches, the sound of a cracking twig, made him start violently and catch his breath.",m
6648,Then at his utmost need came reassurance and something like ease of mind.,m
6649,"He heard a sound of voices at the front of the house, and sprang to his balconied window to listen.",m
6650,Captain Stewart and O'Hara were walking upon the brick-paved terrace and chatting calmly over their cigars.,m
6651,"The man above, prone upon the floor, his head pressed against the ivy-masked grille of the balcony, listened, and though he could hear their words only at intervals when they passed beneath him, he knew that they spoke of trivial matters in voices free of strain or concern.",m
6652,"He drew back with a breath of relief, and at that moment a sound across the room arrested him: a soft scraping sound such as a mouse might make.",m
6653,"He went where it was, and a little square of paper gleamed white through the darkness just within the door.",m
6654,Ste.,m
6655,Marie caught it up and took it to the far side of the room away from the window.,m
6656,"He struck a match, opened the folded paper, and a single line of writing was there--  ""He will go with you.",m
6657,"Wait by the door in the wall.""",m
6658,The man nearly cried out with joy.,m
6659,He struck another match and looked at his watch.,m
6660,It was a quarter to ten.,m
6661,Four hours left out of the fourteen.,m
6662,Once more he lay down upon the bed and closed his eyes.,m
6663,"He knew that he could not sleep, but he was tired from long tramping up and down the room and from the strain of over-tried nerves.",m
6664,"From hour to hour he looked at his watch by match-light, but he did not leave the bed until half-past one.",m
6665,"Then he rose and took a long breath, and the time was at hand.",m
6666,He stood a little while gazing out into the night.,m
6667,"An old moon was high overhead in a cloudless sky, and that would make the night's work both easier and more difficult, but, on the whole, he was glad of it.",m
6668,"He looked to the east towards that wall where was the little wooden door, and the way was under cover of trees and shrubbery for the whole distance save a little space beside the house.",m
6669,"He listened and the night was very still--no sound from the house below him--no sound anywhere save the barking of a dog from far away, and, after an instant, the whistle of a distant train.",m
6670,Ste.,m
6671,Marie turned back into the room and pulled the sheets from his bed.,m
6672,"He rolled them, corner-wise, into a sort of rope and knotted them together securely.",m
6673,Then he went to one of the east windows.,m
6674,"There was no balcony there, but, as in all French upper windows, a wood and iron bar fixed into the stone casing at both ends, with a little grille below it.",m
6675,It crossed the window-space a third of the distance from bottom to top.,m
6676,"He bent one end of the improvised rope to this, made it fast, and let the other end hang out.",m
6677,"The east side of the house was in shadow, and the rolled sheet, a vague white line, disappeared into the darkness below, but Ste.",m
6678,Marie knew that it must reach nearly to the ground.,m
6679,He had made use of it because he was afraid there would be too much noise if he tried to climb down the ivy.,m
6680,"The room directly underneath was the drawing-room, and he knew that it was closed and shuttered and unoccupied both by day and by night.",m
6681,"The only danger, he decided, was from the sleeping-room behind his own, with its windows opening close by; but though he did not know it he was safe there also, for the room was Coira O'Hara's.",m
6682,He felt in his pocket for the pistol and it was ready to hand.,m
6683,Then he buttoned his coat round him and swung himself out of the window.,m
6684,"He held his body away from the wall with one knee, and went down, hand under hand.",m
6685,It was so quietly done that it did not even rouse the birds in the near-by trees.,m
6686,Before he realised that he had come to the lower windows his feet touched the earth and he was free.,m
6687,"He stood for a moment where he was, and then slipped rapidly across the open moonlit space into the inky gloom of the trees.",m
6688,He made a half-circle round before the house and looked up at it.,m
6689,It lay grey and black and still in the night.,m
6690,"Where the moonlight was upon it it was grey, where there was shadow black as black velvet, and the windows were like open dead eyes.",m
6691,"He looked towards Arthur Benham's room, and there was no light, but he knew that the boy was awake and waiting there, shivering probably in the dark.",m
6692,"He wondered where Coira O'Hara was, and he pictured her lying in her bed fronting the gloom with sleepless open eyes looking into those to-morrows which she had said she saw so well.",m
6693,"He wondered bitterly what the to-morrows were to bring her, but he caught himself up with a stern determination and put her out of his mind.",m
6694,He did not dare think of her in that hour.,m
6695,He turned and began to make his way silently under the trees towards the appointed meeting place.,m
6696,"Once he thought of the old Michel, and wondered where that gnarled and withered watch-dog had betaken himself.",m
6697,"Somewhere, within or without the house, he was asleep, or pretended to sleep, and Ste.",m
6698,Marie knew that he could be trusted.,m
6699,"The man's cupidity and his hatred of Captain Stewart together would make him faithful--or faithless, as one chose to look upon it.",m
6700,He came to that place where a row of lilac shrubs stood against the wall and a half-dead cedar stretched gnarled branches above.,m
6701,"He was a little before his time, and he settled himself to listen and wait, his sharp ears keenly on the alert, his eyes turned towards the dark and quiet house.",m
6702,The little noises of the night broke upon him with exaggerated clamour.,m
6703,"A crackling twig was a thunderous crash, a bird's sleepy stir was the sound of pursuit and disaster.",m
6704,"A hundred times he heard the cautious approach of Richard Hartley's motor-car without the wall, and he fell into a panic of fear lest that machine prove unruly, break down, puncture a tyre, or burst into a series of ear-splitting explosions.",m
6705,But at last--it seemed to him that he had waited untold hours and that the dawn must be nigh--there came an unmistakable rustling from overhead and the sound of hard-drawn breath.,m
6706,"The top of the wall, just at that point, was in moonlight, and a man's head appeared over it, then an arm and then a leg.",m
6707,"Hartley called down to him in a whisper, and Ste.",m
6708,"Marie, from the gloom beneath, whispered a reply.",m
6709,"He said--  ""The boy has promised to come with us.",m
6710,"We shan't have to fight for it.""",m
6711,"Richard Hartley said--  ""Thank God!""",m
6712,"He spoke to some one outside and then, turning about, let himself down to arm's length and dropped to the ground.",m
6713,"""Thank God!"" he said again.",m
6714,"""The two men who were to have come with me didn't show up.",m
6715,"I waited as long as I dared, and then came on with only the chauffeur.",m
6716,He's waiting outside by the car ready to crank up when I give the word.,m
6717,The car's just a few yards away headed out for the road.,m
6718,"How are we to get back over the wall?""",m
6719,Ste.,m
6720,"Marie explained that Arthur Benham was to come out to join them at the wooden door, and doubtless would bring a key.",m
6721,"If not, the three of them could scale fifteen feet easily enough in the way soldiers and firemen are trained to do it.",m
6722,"He told his friend all that was necessary for the time, and they went together along the wall to the more open space beside the little door.",m
6723,"They waited there in silence for five minutes, and once Hartley, with his back towards the house, struck a match under his sheltering coat, looked to see what time it was, and it was three minutes past two.",m
6724,"""He ought to be here!"" the man growled.",m
6725,"""I don't like waiting.",m
6726,"Good Lord, you don't think he's funked it, do you?",m
6727,"Eh?""",m
6728,Ste.,m
6729,"Marie did not answer, but he was breathing very fast and he could not keep his hands still.",m
6730,"The dog which he had heard from his window began barking again very far away in the night, and kept it up incessantly.",m
6731,Perhaps he was barking at the moon.,m
6732,"""I'm going a little way towards the house,"" said Ste.",m
6733,Marie at last.,m
6734,"""We can't see the terrace from here.""",m
6735,"But before he had started they heard the sound of hurrying feet, and Richard Hartley began to curse under his breath.",m
6736,"He said--  ""Does the young idiot want to rouse the whole place?",m
6737,"Why can't he come quietly?""",m
6738,Ste.,m
6739,"Marie began to run forward, slipping the pistol out of his pocket and holding it ready in his hand, for his quick ears told him that there was more than one pair of feet coming through the night.",m
6740,"He went to where he could command the approach from the house and halted there, but all at once he gave a low cry and started forward again, for he saw that Arthur Benham and Coira O'Hara were running together, and that they were in desperate haste.",m
6741,"He called out to them and the girl cried--  ""Go to the door in the wall!",m
6742,The door in the wall!,m
6743,"Oh, be quick!""",m
6744,"He fell into step beside her, and, as they ran, he said--  ""You're going with him?",m
6745,"You're coming with us?""",m
6746,"The girl answered him--  ""No! no!"" and she sprang to the little low door and began to fit the iron key into the lock.",m
6747,"The three men stood about her, and young Arthur Benham drew his breath in great shivering gasps that were like sobs.",m
6748,"""They heard us!"" he cried in a whisper.",m
6749,"""They're after us.",m
6750,They heard us on the stairs.,m
6751,I--stumbled and fell.,m
6752,"For God's sake, Coira, be quick!""",m
6753,"The girl fumbled desperately with the clumsy key, and dropped upon her knees to see the better.",m
6754,"Once she said in a whisper: ""I can't turn it.",m
6755,"It won't turn,"" and at that Richard Hartley pushed her out of the way and lent his greater strength to the task.",m
6756,"A sudden loud cry came from the house, a hoarse screeching cry in a voice which might have been either man's or woman's, but was as mad and as desperate and as horrible in that still night as the screech of a tortured animal--or of a maniac.",m
6757,It came again and again and it was nearer.,m
6758,"""Oh, hurry!  hurry!"" said the girl.",m
6759,"""Can't you be quick?",m
6760,"They're coming.""",m
6761,"And, as she spoke, the little group about the wall heard the engine of the motor-car outside start up with a staccato roar, and knew that the faithful chauffeur was ready for them.",m
6762,"""I'm getting it, I think!"" said Richard Hartley between his teeth.",m
6763,"""I'm getting it.",m
6764,"Turn, you beast!",m
6765,"Turn!""",m
6766,"There was a sound of hurrying feet, and Ste.",m
6767,Marie spun about.,m
6768,"He cried--  ""Don't wait for me!",m
6769,Jump into the car and go!,m
6770,Don't wait anywhere.,m
6771,"Come back after you've left Benham at home!""",m
6772,"He began to run forward toward those running feet, and he did not know that the girl followed after him.",m
6773,"A short distance away there was a little open space of moonlight, and in its midst, at full career, he met the Irishman O'Hara, a gaunt and grotesque figure in his sleeping suit, barefooted, with empty hands.",m
6774,"Beyond him still, some one else ran stumbling, and sobbed and uttered mad cries.",m
6775,Ste.,m
6776,Marie dropped his pistol to the ground and sprang upon the Irishman.,m
6777,"He caught him about the body and arms, and the two swayed and staggered under the tremendous impact.",m
6778,"At just that moment, from behind, came the crash of the opened door and triumphant shouts.",m
6779,Ste.,m
6780,"Marie gave a little gasp of triumph too, and clung the harder to the man with whom he fought.",m
6781,"He drove his head into the Irishman's shoulder, and set his muscles with a grip which was like iron.",m
6782,"He knew that it could not endure long, for the Irishman was stronger than he; but the grip of a nervous man who is keyed up to a high tension is incredibly powerful for a little while.",m
6783,Trained strength is nothing beside it.,m
6784,It seemed to Ste.,m
6785,Marie in this desperate moment--it cannot have been more than a minute or two at the most--that a strange and uncanny miracle befel him.,m
6786,It was as if he became two.,m
6787,"Soul and body, spirit and straining flesh, seemed to him to separate, to stand apart each from the other.",m
6788,"There was a thing of iron flesh and thews which had locked itself about an enemy, and clung there madly with but one purpose, one single thought--to grip and grip and never loosen until flesh should be torn from bones.",m
6789,"But apart, the spirit looked on with a complete detachment.",m
6790,"It looked beyond--he must have raised his head to glance over O'Hara's shoulder--saw a mad figure staggering forward in the moonlight, and knew the figure for Captain Stewart.",m
6791,"It saw an upraised arm and was not afraid, for the work was almost done now.",m
6792,"It listened and was glad, hearing the motor-car without the walls leap forward into the night, and its puffing grow fainter and fainter with distance.",m
6793,"It knew that the thing of strained sinews received a crashing blow upon back-flung head, and that the iron muscles were slipping away from their grip, but it was still glad, for the work was done.",m
6794,"Only at the last, before red and whirling lights had obscured the view, before consciousness was dissolved in unconsciousness, came horror and agony, for the eyes saw Captain Stewart back away and raise the thing he had struck with, a large revolver, saw Coira O'Hara, a swift and flashing figure in the moonlight, throw herself upon him, before he could fire, heard together a woman's scream and the roar of the pistol's explosion, and so knew no more.                                                               When Coira O'Hara came to herself from the moment's swoon into which she had fallen she rose to her knees and stared wildly about her.",m
6795,"She seemed to be alone in the place, and her first thought was to wonder how long she had lain there.",m
6796,Captain Stewart had disappeared.,m
6797,She remembered her struggle with him to prevent him from firing at Ste.,m
6798,"Marie, and she remembered her desperate agony when she realised that she could not hold him much longer.",m
6799,"She remembered the accidental discharge of the revolver into the air, she remembered being thrown violently to the ground--and that was all.",m
6800,Where was her father and where was Ste.,m
6801,Marie?,m
6802,"The first question answered itself, for, as she turned her eyes towards the west, she saw O'Hara's tall ungainly figure disappearing in the direction of the house.",m
6803,"She called his name twice, but it may be that the man did not hear for he went on without pausing and was lost to sight.",m
6804,"The girl became aware of something which lay on the ground near her, half in and half out of the patch of silver moonlight.",m
6805,For some moments she stared at it uncomprehending.,m
6806,Then she gave a sharp scream and struggled to her feet.,m
6807,She ran to the thing which lay there motionless and fell upon her knees beside it.,m
6808,It was Ste.,m
6809,"Marie, his face upturned to the sky, one side of his head black and damp.",m
6810,"Stewart had not shot him, but that crashing blow with the clubbed revolver had struck him full and fair and he was very still.",m
6811,"For an instant the girl's strength went out of her and she dropped lax across the body, her face upon Ste.",m
6812,Marie's breast.,m
6813,But after that she tore open coat and waistcoat and felt for a heartbeat.,m
6814,"It seemed to her that she found life, and she began to believe that the man had only been stunned.",m
6815,Once more she rose to her feet and looked about her.,m
6816,There was no one to lend her aid.,m
6817,She bent over the unconscious man and slipped her arms about him.,m
6818,Though Ste.,m
6819,"Marie was tall he was slightly built, by no means heavy, and the girl was very strong.",m
6820,"She found that she could carry him a little way, dragging his feet after her.",m
6821,"When she could go no farther she laid him down, and crouched over him, waiting until her strength should return.",m
6822,"And this she did for a score of times; but each time the distance she went was shorter, and her breathing came with deeper gasps, and the trembling in her limbs grew more terrible.",m
6823,"At the last she moved in a sort of fever, an evil dream of tortured body and reeling brain.",m
6824,But she had got Ste.,m
6825,"Marie up through the park to the terrace and into the house, and, with a last desperate effort, she had laid him upon a couch in a certain little room which opened from the lower hall.",m
6826,Then she fell down before him and lay still for a long time.,m
6827,When she came to herself again the man was stirring feebly and muttering to himself under his breath.,m
6828,"With slow and painful steps she got across the room, and pulled the bell cord.",m
6829,"She remained there ringing until the old Justine, blinking and half dressed, appeared with a candle in the doorway.",m
6830,Coira told the woman to make lights and then to bring water and a certain little bottle of aromatic salts which was in her room upstairs.,m
6831,"The old Justine exclaimed and cried out, but the girl flew at her in a white fury, and she tottered away as fast as old legs could move, once she had set alight the row of candles on the mantel shelf.",m
6832,"Then Coira O'Hara went back to the man who lay outstretched on the low couch, and knelt beside him looking into his face.",m
6833,The man stirred and moved his head slowly.,m
6834,"Half articulate words came from his lips and she made out that he was saying her name in a dull monotone--only her name, over and over again.",m
6835,"She gave a little cry of grief and gladness, and hid her face against him as she had done once before, out in the night.",m
6836,"The old woman returned with a jug of water, towels and the bottle of aromatic salts.",m
6837,The two of them washed that red stain from Ste.,m
6838,"Marie's head and found that he had received a severe bruise, and that the flesh had been cut before and above the ear.",m
6839,"""Thank God!"" the girl said, ""it is only a flesh wound.",m
6840,If it were a fracture he would be breathing in that horrible loud way they always do.,m
6841,He's breathing naturally.,m
6842,He has only been stunned.,m
6843,"""You may go now!"" she said.",m
6844,"""Only, bring a glass and some drinking water--cold.""",m
6845,"So the old woman went away to do her errand, returned and went away again, and the two were left together.",m
6846,Coira held the salts bottle to Ste.,m
6847,"Marie's nostrils, and he gasped and sneezed and tried to turn his head away from it, but it brought him to his senses--and doubtless to a good deal of pain.",m
6848,"Once when he could not escape the thing he broke into a fit of weak cursing, and the girl laughed over him tenderly and let him be.",m
6849,Very slowly Ste.,m
6850,"Marie opened his eyes and, in the soft half light, the girl's face was bent above him, dark and sweet and beautiful--near, so near that her breath was warm upon his lips.",m
6851,"He said her name again in an incredulous whisper--  ""Coira!",m
6852,"Coira!""",m
6853,"And she said--  ""I am here.""",m
6854,"But the man was in a strange borderland of half consciousness, and his ears were deaf.",m
6855,"He said, gazing up at her--  ""Is it--another dream?""",m
6856,"And he tried to raise one hand from where it lay beside him, but the hand wavered and fell aslant across his body.",m
6857,It had not the strength yet to obey him.,m
6858,"He said, still in his weak whisper--  ""Oh, beautiful--and sweet--and true!""",m
6859,The girl gave a little sob and hid her face.,m
6860,"""A goddess!"" he whispered.",m
6861,"""'A queen among goddesses!'",m
6862,That's--what the little Jew said.,m
6863,"'A queen among goddesses.--The young Juno, before----'""  He stirred restlessly where he lay, and he complained--  ""My head hurts!",m
6864,What's the matter with my head?,m
6865,"It hurts.""",m
6866,She dipped one of the towels in the basin of cold water and held it to the man's brow.,m
6867,The chill of it must have been grateful for his eyes closed and he breathed a little satisfied.,m
6868,"""Ah!",m
6869,"""It mustn't hurt to-night,"" said he.",m
6870,"""To-night at two--by the little door in the garden wall.",m
6871,And he's coming with us.,m
6872,The young fool is coming with us....,m
6873,So she and I go out of each other's lives....,m
6874,"""Coira!"" he cried with a sudden sharpness.",m
6875,"""Coira, I won't have it!",m
6876,Am I going to lose you ... like this?,m
6877,"Am I going to lose you after all ... now that we know?""",m
6878,He put up his hand once more--a weak and uncertain hand.,m
6879,It touched the girl's warm cheek and a sudden violent shiver wrung the man on the couch.,m
6880,His eyes sharpened and stared with something like fear.,m
6881,"""Real!"" he cried, whispering.",m
6882,"""Real? ...",m
6883,"Not a dream?""",m
6884,"""Oh, very real, my Bayard!"" said she.",m
6885,"A thought came to her and she drew away from the couch, and sat back upon her heels, looking at the man with grave and sombre eyes.",m
6886,In that moment she fought within herself a battle of right and wrong.,m
6887,"""He doesn't remember,"" she said.",m
6888,"""He doesn't know.",m
6889,He is like a little child.,m
6890,He knows nothing but that we two--are here together.,m
6891,Nothing else.,m
6892,"Nothing!""",m
6893,His state was plain to see.,m
6894,He dwelt still in that vague borderland between worlds.,m
6895,"He had brought with him no memories, and no memories followed him save those her face had wakened.",m
6896,Within the girl a great and tender passion of love fought for possession of this little hour.,m
6897,"""It will be all I shall ever have!"" she cried piteously.",m
6898,"""And it cannot harm him.",m
6899,He won't remember it when he comes to his senses.,m
6900,He'll sleep again and--forget.,m
6901,He'll go back to her and never know.,m
6902,And I shall never even see him again.,m
6903,"Why can't I have my little sweet hour?""",m
6904,"Once more the man cried her name, and she knelt forward and bent above him.",m
6905,"""Oh, at last, Coira!"" said he.",m
6906,"""After so long! ...",m
6907,"And I thought it was another dream.""",m
6908,"""Do you dream of me, Bayard?"" she asked.",m
6909,"And he said--  ""From the very first.",m
6910,From that evening in the Champs Elysees.,m
6911,"Your eyes, they've haunted me from the very first.",m
6912,"""There was a dream of you,"" he said, ""that I had so often--but I cannot quite remember because my head hurts.",m
6913,What is the matter with my head?,m
6914,I was--going somewhere.,m
6915,"It was so very important that I should go, but I have forgotten where it was and why I had to go there.",m
6916,I remember only that you called to me--called me back--and I saw your eyes--and I couldn't go.,m
6917,"You needed me.""",m
6918,"""Ah, sorely, Bayard!",m
6919,"Sorely!"" cried the girl above him.",m
6920,"""And now,"" said he, whispering.",m
6921,"""Now?"" she said.",m
6922,"""Coira, I love you,"" said the man on the couch.",m
6923,And Coira O'Hara gave a single dry sob.,m
6924,"She said--  ""Oh, my dear love! now I wish that I might die after hearing you say that.",m
6925,"My life, Bayard, is full now.",m
6926,It's full of joy and gratefulness and everything that is sweet.,m
6927,"I wish I might die before other things come to spoil it.""",m
6928,Ste.,m
6929,"Marie--or that part of him which lay at La Lierre, laughed with a fine scorn, albeit very weakly.",m
6930,"""Why not live instead?"" said he.",m
6931,"""And what can come to spoil our life for us?",m
6932,"""Our life!"" he said again in a whisper.",m
6933,"A flash of remembrance seemed to come to him for he smiled, and said--  ""Coira, we'll go to Vavau.""",m
6934,"""Anywhere!"" said she.",m
6935,"""Anywhere!""",m
6936,"""So that we go together.""",m
6937,"""Yes,"" she said gently, ""so that we two go together.""",m
6938,"She tried with a desperate fierceness to make herself like the man before her, to put away, by sheer power of will, all memory, the knowledge of everything save what was in this little room, but it was the vainest of all vain efforts.",m
6939,"She saw herself for a thief and a cheat--stealing, for love's sake, the mere body of the man she loved while mind and soul were absent.",m
6940,In her agony she almost cried out aloud as the words said themselves within her.,m
6941,And she denied them.,m
6942,"She said--  ""His mind may be absent but his soul is here.",m
6943,He loves me.,m
6944,"It is I, not that other.",m
6945,Can I not have my poor little hour of pretence?,m
6946,A little hour out of all a lifetime!,m
6947,"Shall I have nothing at all?""",m
6948,"But the voice which had accused her said--  ""If he knew, would he say he loves you?""",m
6949,"And she hid her face, for she knew that he would not--even if it were true.",m
6950,"""Coira!"" whispered the man on the couch, and she raised her head.",m
6951,In the half darkness he could not have seen how she was suffering.,m
6952,"Her face was only a warm blur to him, vague and sweet and beautiful, with tender eyes.",m
6953,"He said--  ""I think--I'm falling asleep.",m
6954,"My head is so very, very queer!",m
6955,What is the matter with my head?,m
6956,"Coira, do you think I might be kissed before I go to sleep?""",m
6957,She gave a little cry of intolerable anguish.,m
6958,It seemed to her that she was being tortured beyond all reason or endurance.,m
6959,She felt suddenly very weak and she was afraid that she was going to faint away.,m
6960,She laid her face down upon the couch where Ste.,m
6961,Marie's head lay.,m
6962,Her cheek was against his and her hair across his eyes.,m
6963,The man gave a little contented sigh and fell asleep.,m
6964,"Later, she rose stiffly and wearily to her feet.",m
6965,She stood for a little while looking down upon him.,m
6966,It was as if she looked upon the dead body of a lover.,m
6967,She seemed to say a still and white and tearless farewell to him.,m
6968,"Her little hour was done, and it had been, instead of joy, bitterness unspeakable: ashes in the mouth.",m
6969,Then she went out of the room and closed the door.,m
6970,"In the hall outside she stood a moment considering, and finally mounted the stairs and went to her father's door.",m
6971,"She knocked and thought she heard a slight stirring inside, but there was no answer.",m
6972,"She knocked twice again and called out her father's name, saying that she wished to speak to him, but still he made no reply, and, after waiting a little longer, she turned away.",m
6973,She went downstairs again and out upon the terrace.,m
6974,"The terrace and the lawn before it were still chequered with silver and deep black, but the moon was an hour lower in the west.",m
6975,A little cool breeze had sprung up and it was sweet and grateful to her.,m
6976,"She sat down upon one of the stone benches and leant her head back against the trunk of a tree which stood beside, and she remained there for a long time, still and relaxed in a sort of bodily and mental languor--an exhaustion of flesh and spirit.",m
6977,"There came shambling footsteps upon the turf and the old Michel advanced into the moonlight from the gloom of the trees, emitting mechanical and not very realistic groans.",m
6978,He had been hard put to it to find any one before whom he could pour out his tale of heroism and suffering.,m
6979,"Coira O'Hara looked upon him coldly, and the gnome groaned with renewed and somewhat frightened energy.",m
6980,"""What is the matter with you?"" she asked.",m
6981,"""Why are you about at this hour?""",m
6982,"The old Michel told his piteous tale with tears and passion, protesting that he had succumbed only before the combined attack of twenty armed men, and exhibiting his wounds.",m
6983,But the girl gave a brief and mirthless laugh.,m
6984,"""You were bribed to tell that, I suppose,"" said she.",m
6985,"""By M. Ste.",m
6986,Marie?,m
6987,"Yes, probably.",m
6988,"Well, tell it to my father to-morrow!",m
6989,"You'd better go to bed now.""",m
6990,"The old man stared at her with open mouth for a breathless moment, and then shambled hastily away, looking over his shoulder, at intervals, until he was out of sight.",m
6991,But after that the girl still remained in her place from sheer weariness and lack of impulse to move.,m
6992,"She fell to wondering about Captain Stewart and what had become of him, but she did not greatly care.",m
6993,"She had a feeling that her world had come to its end, and she was quite indifferent about those who still peopled its ashes--or about all of them save her father.",m
6994,"She heard the distant sound of a motor-car, and at that sat up quickly, for it might be Ste.",m
6995,Marie's friend Mr. Hartley returning from Paris.,m
6996,"The sound came nearer and ceased, but she waited for ten minutes before rapid steps approached from the east wall and Hartley was before her.",m
6997,"He cried at once--  ""Where's Ste.",m
6998,Marie?,m
6999,Where is he?,m
7000,"He hasn't tried to walk into the city?""",m
7001,"""He is asleep in the house,"" said the girl.",m
7002,"""He was struck on the head and stunned.",m
7003,I got him into the house and he is asleep now.,m
7004,"""Of course,"" she said, ""we could wake him, but it would probably be better to let him sleep as long as he will if it is possible.",m
7005,It will save him a great deal of pain I think.,m
7006,He'll have a frightful headache if he's wakened now.,m
7007,"Could you come for him or send for him to-morrow--towards noon?""",m
7008,"""Why--yes, I suppose so,"" said Richard Hartley.",m
7009,"""Yes, of course, if you think that's better.",m
7010,"Could I just see him for a moment?""",m
7011,"He stared at the girl a bit suspiciously and Coira looked back at him with a little tired smile, for she read his thought.",m
7012,"""You want to make sure,"" said she.",m
7013,"""Of course!",m
7014,"Yes, come in.",m
7015,"He's sleeping very soundly.""",m
7016,She led the man into that dim room where Ste.,m
7017,"Marie lay, and Hartley's quick eye noted the basin of water and the stained towels and the little bottle of aromatic salts.",m
7018,"He bent over his friend to see the bruise at the side of the head, and listened to the sleeper's breathing.",m
7019,Then the two went out again to the moonlit terrace.,m
7020,"""You must forgive me,"" said he when they had come there.",m
7021,"""You must forgive me for seeming suspicious, but--all this wretched business--and he is my closest friend.--I've come to suspect everybody.",m
7022,"I was unjust, for you helped us to get away.",m
7023,"I beg your pardon!""",m
7024,"The girl smiled at him again, her little white tired smile, and she said--  ""There is nothing I would not do to make amends--now that I know--the truth.""",m
7025,"""Yes,"" said Hartley.",m
7026,"""I understand.",m
7027,Arthur Benham told me how Stewart lied to you all.,m
7028,Was it he who struck Ste.,m
7029,"Marie?""",m
7030,She nodded.,m
7031,"""And then tried to shoot him--but he didn't succeed in that.",m
7032,"I wonder where he is--Captain Stewart?""",m
7033,"""I have him out in the car,"" Hartley said.",m
7034,"""Oh, he shall pay, you may be sure!",m
7035,"If he doesn't die and cheat us, that is.",m
7036,I nearly ran the car over him a few minutes ago.,m
7037,If it hadn't been for the moonlight I would have done for him.,m
7038,He was lying on his face in that lane that leads to the Issy road.,m
7039,I don't know what is the matter with him.,m
7040,He's only half conscious and he's quite helpless.,m
7041,He looks as if he'd had a stroke of apoplexy or something.,m
7042,"I must hurry him back to Paris, I suppose, and get him under a doctor's care.",m
7043,"I wonder what's wrong with him?""",m
7044,"The girl shook her head, for she did not know of Stewart's epileptic seizures.",m
7045,"She thought it quite possible that he had suffered a stroke of apoplexy as Hartley suggested, for she remembered the half-mad state he had been in.",m
7046,Richard Hartley stood for a time in thought.,m
7047,"""I must get Stewart back to Paris at once,"" he said finally.",m
7048,"""I must get him under care, and in a safe place from which he can't escape.",m
7049,It will want some managing.,m
7050,"If I can get away, I'll come out here again in the morning; but if not, I'll send the car out with orders to wait here until Ste.",m
7051,Marie is ready to return to the city.,m
7052,"Are you sure he's all right--that he isn't badly hurt?""",m
7053,"""I think he will be all right,"" she said, ""save for the pain.",m
7054,"He was only stunned.""",m
7055,And Hartley nodded.,m
7056,"""He seems to be breathing quite naturally,"" said he.",m
7057,"""That's arranged then.",m
7058,"The car will be here in waiting, and I shall come with it if I can.",m
7059,"Tell him when he wakes.""",m
7060,"He put out his hand to her, and the girl gave him hers very listlessly but smiling.",m
7061,"She wished he would go, and leave her alone.",m
7062,"Then in a moment more he did go, and she heard his quick steps down through the trees, and heard, a little later, the engine of the motor car start up with a sudden loud volley of explosions.",m
7063,And so she was left to her solitary watch.,m
7064,She noticed as she turned to go indoors that the blackness of the night was just beginning to grey towards dawn.                                                              Ste.,m
7065,"Marie slept soundly until mid-morning--that is to say, about ten o'clock--and then awoke with a dull pain in his head and a sensation of extreme giddiness, which became something like vertigo when he attempted to rise.",m
7066,"However, with the aid of the old Michel he got somehow upstairs to his room, and made a rather sketchy toilet.",m
7067,"Coira came to him there and, while he lay still across the bed, told him about the happenings of the night after he had received his injury.",m
7068,"She told him also that the motor was waiting for him, outside the wall, and that Richard Hartley had sent a message by the chauffeur, to say that he was very busy in Paris making arrangements about Stewart, who had come out of his strange state of half insensibility only to rave in a delirium.",m
7069,"""So,"" she said, ""you can go now whenever you are ready.",m
7070,"Arthur is with his family, Captain Stewart is under guard, and your work is done.",m
7071,"You ought to be glad--even though you are suffering pain.""",m
7072,Ste.,m
7073,Marie looked up at her.,m
7074,"""Do I seem glad, Coira?"" said he.",m
7075,"And she said--  ""You will be glad to-morrow--and always, I hope and pray.",m
7076,"Always, always!""",m
7077,The man held one hand over his aching eyes.,m
7078,"""I have,"" he said, ""queer half-memories.",m
7079,"I wish I could remember distinctly.""",m
7080,He looked up at her again.,m
7081,"""I dropped down by the gate in the wall.",m
7082,When I awoke I was in a room in the house.,m
7083,"How did that happen?""",m
7084,"""Oh,"" she said, turning her face away, ""we got you up to the house almost at once.""",m
7085,But Ste.,m
7086,Marie frowned thoughtfully.,m
7087,"""'We'?",m
7088,"Who do you mean by 'we'?""",m
7089,"""Well then, I,"" the girl said.",m
7090,"""It was not difficult.""",m
7091,"""Coira!"" cried the man, ""do you mean that you carried me bodily all that long distance?",m
7092,"You?""",m
7093,"""Carried or dragged,"" she said.",m
7094,"""As much one as the other.",m
7095,It was not very difficult.,m
7096,"I'm strong, for a woman.""",m
7097,"""Oh, child, child!"" he cried.",m
7098,"And he said--  ""I remember more.",m
7099,"It was you who held Stewart, and kept him from shooting me.",m
7100,I heard the shot and I heard you scream.,m
7101,The last thought I had was that you had been killed in saving me.,m
7102,"That's what I went out into the blank, thinking.""",m
7103,He covered his eyes again as if the memory were intolerable.,m
7104,"But after a while he said--  ""You saved my life, you know.""",m
7105,"And the girl answered him--  ""I had nearly taken it once before.",m
7106,"It was I who called Michel that day you came over the wall, the day you were shot.",m
7107,I nearly murdered you once.,m
7108,I owed you something.,m
7109,"Perhaps we're even now.""",m
7110,"She saw that he did not at all remember that hour in the little room--her hour of bitterness, and she was glad.",m
7111,She had felt sure that it would be so.,m
7112,For the present she did not greatly suffer; she had come to a state beyond active suffering--a chill state of dulled sensibilities.,m
7113,"The old Justine knocked at the door to ask if monsieur was going into the city soon, or if she should give the chauffeur his dejeuner and tell him to wait.",m
7114,"""Are you fit to go?""",m
7115,Coira asked.,m
7116,"And he said--  ""I suppose as fit as I shall be.""",m
7117,"He got to his feet, and the things about him swam dangerously, but he could walk by using great care.",m
7118,"The girl stood white and still, and she avoided his eyes.",m
7119,"""It is not good-bye,"" said he.",m
7120,"""I shall see you soon again--and I hope, often--often, Coira.""",m
7121,"The words had a flat and foolish sound, but he could find no others.",m
7122,It was not easy to speak.,m
7123,"""I suppose I must not ask to see your father?"" said he, and she told him that her father had locked himself in his own room and would see no one, would not even open his door to take in food.",m
7124,Ste.,m
7125,"Marie went to the stairs, leaning upon the shoulder of the stout old Justine, but, before he had gone, Coira checked him for an instant.",m
7126,"She said--  ""Tell Arthur, if he speaks to you about me, that what I said in the note I gave him last night, I meant quite seriously.",m
7127,I gave him a note to read after he reached home.,m
7128,Tell him for me that it was final.,m
7129,"Will you do that?""",m
7130,"""Yes, of course,"" said Ste.",m
7131,Marie.,m
7132,He looked at her with some wonder because her words had been very emphatic.,m
7133,"""Yes,"" he said, ""I will tell him.",m
7134,"Is that all?""",m
7135,"""All but good-bye,"" said she.",m
7136,"""Good-bye, Bayard!""",m
7137,She stood at the head of the stairs while he went down them.,m
7138,And she came after him to the landing halfway where the stairs turned in the opposite direction for their lower flight.,m
7139,"When he went out of the front door he looked back, and she was standing there above him--a straight, still figure, dark against the light of the windows behind her.",m
7140,He went straight to the Rue d'Assas.,m
7141,"He found that while he sat still in the comfortable tonneau of the motor his head was fairly normal, and the world did not swing and whirl about in that sickening fashion.",m
7142,"But when the car lurched or bumped over an obstruction it made him giddy, and he would have fallen had he been standing.",m
7143,The familiar streets of the Montparnasse and Luxembourg quarters had for his eyes all the charm and delight of home things to the returned traveller.,m
7144,"He felt as if he had been away for months, and he caught himself looking for changes, and it made him laugh.",m
7145,"He was much relieved when he found that his concierge was not on watch, and that he could slip unobserved up the stairs and into his rooms.",m
7146,"The rooms were fresh and clean, for they had been aired and tended daily.",m
7147,"Arrived there he wrote a little note to a friend of his who was a doctor and lived in the Rue Notre Dame des Champs, asking this man to call as soon as it might be convenient.",m
7148,"He sent the note by the chauffeur, and then lay down, dressed as he was, to wait, for he could not stand or move about without a painful dizziness.",m
7149,"The doctor came within a half-hour, examined Ste.",m
7150,Marie's bruised head and bound it up.,m
7151,"He gave him a dose of something with a vile taste, which he said would take away the worst of the pain in a few hours, and he also gave him a sleeping potion, and made him go to bed.",m
7152,"""You'll be fairly fit by evening,"" he said.",m
7153,"""But don't stir until then.",m
7154,"I'll leave word below that you're not to be disturbed.""",m
7155,"So it happened that when Richard Hartley came dashing up an hour or two later he was not allowed to see his friend, and Ste.",m
7156,Marie slept a dreamless sleep until dark.,m
7157,"He awoke then, refreshed but ravenous with hunger, and found that there was only a dull ache in his battered head.",m
7158,The dizziness and the vertigo were almost completely gone.,m
7159,He made lights and dressed with care.,m
7160,He felt like a little girl making ready for a party; it was so long--or seemed so long--since he had put on evening clothes.,m
7161,"Then he went out, leaving at the loge of the concierge a note for Hartley to say where he might be found.",m
7162,"He went to Lavenue's and dined in solitary pomp, for it was after nine o'clock.",m
7163,Again it seemed to him that it was months since he had done the like--sat down to a real table for a real dinner.,m
7164,At ten he got into a fiacre and drove to the Rue de l'Universite.,m
7165,"The man who admitted him said that mademoiselle was alone in the drawing-room, and he went there at once.",m
7166,"He was dully conscious that something was very wrong, but he had suffered too much within the past few hours to be analytical, and he did not know what it was that was wrong.",m
7167,"He should have entered that room with a swift and eager step, with shining eyes, with a high-beating heart.",m
7168,"He went into it slowly, wrapped in a mantle of strange apathy.",m
7169,Helen Benham came forward to meet him and took both his hands in hers.,m
7170,Ste.,m
7171,"Marie was amazed to see that she seemed not to have altered at all--in spite of this enormous lapse of time, in spite of all that had happened in it.",m
7172,"And yet, unaltered, she seemed to him a stranger, a charming and gracious stranger with an icily beautiful face, He wondered at her and at himself, and he was a little alarmed, because he thought that he must be ill.",m
7173,"That blow upon the head must, after all, have done something terrible to him.",m
7174,"""Ah, Ste.",m
7175,"Marie!"" she said in her well-remembered voice--and again he wondered that the voice should be so high-pitched, and so without colour or feeling.",m
7176,"""How glad I am,"" she said, ""that you are safely out of it all!",m
7177,"How you have suffered for us, Ste.",m
7178,Marie!,m
7179,You look white and ill.,m
7180,"Sit down, please!",m
7181,"Don't stand!""",m
7182,"She drew him to a comfortable chair, and he sat down in it obediently.",m
7183,"He could not think of anything to say, though he was not, as a rule, tongue-tied, but the girl did not seem to expect any answer, for she went on at once with a rather odd air of haste--  ""Arthur is here with us, safe and sound.",m
7184,"Richard Hartley brought him back from that dreadful place, and he has talked everything over with my grandfather, and it's all right.",m
7185,"They both understand now, and there'll be no more trouble.",m
7186,"We have had to be careful, very careful, and we have had to--well, to rearrange the facts a little so as to leave--my uncle--to leave Captain Stewart's name out of it.",m
7187,It would not do to shock my grandfather by telling him the truth.,m
7188,"Perhaps, later;",m
7189,I don't know.,m
7190,That will have to be thought of.,m
7191,For the present we have left my uncle out of it--and put the blame entirely upon this other man.,m
7192,"I forget his name.""",m
7193,"""The blame cannot rest there,"" said Ste.",m
7194,Marie sharply.,m
7195,"""It is not deserved, and I shall not allow it to be left so.",m
7196,Captain Stewart lied to O'Hara throughout.,m
7197,"You cannot leave the blame with an innocent man.""",m
7198,"""Still--"" she said, ""such a man!""",m
7199,Ste.,m
7200,"Marie looked at her, frowning, and the girl turned her eyes away.",m
7201,She may have had the grace to be a little ashamed.,m
7202,"""Think of the difficulty we were in!"" she urged.",m
7203,"""Captain Stewart is my grandfather's own son.",m
7204,"We cannot tell him now, in his weak state, that his own son is--what he is.""",m
7205,"There was reason if not justice in that, and Ste.",m
7206,Marie was forced to admit it.,m
7207,"He said--  ""Ah well! for the present, then.",m
7208,That can be arranged later.,m
7209,The main point is that I've found your brother for you.,m
7210,"I've brought him back.""",m
7211,"Miss Benham looked up at him and away again, and she drew a quick breath.",m
7212,"He saw her hands move restlessly in her lap, and he was aware that for some odd reason she was very ill at ease.",m
7213,"At last she said--  ""Ah, but--but have you, dear Ste.",m
7214,Marie?,m
7215,"Have you?""",m
7216,"After a brief silence she stole another swift glance at the man, and he was staring in open and frank bewilderment.",m
7217,She rushed into rapid speech.,m
7218,"""Ah,"" she cried, ""don't misunderstand me!",m
7219,Don't think that I'm brutal or ungrateful for all you've--you've suffered in trying to help us.,m
7220,Don't think that!,m
7221,"I can--we can never be grateful enough, never!",m
7222,But stop and think!,m
7223,"Yes, I know this all sounds hideous, but it's so terribly important.",m
7224,"I shouldn't dream of saying a word of it if it weren't so important, if so much didn't depend upon it.",m
7225,But stop and think!,m
7226,"Was it, dear Ste.",m
7227,"Marie, was it, after all, you?",m
7228,"Was it you who brought Arthur to us?""",m
7229,"The man fairly blinked at her, owl-like.",m
7230,He was beyond speech.,m
7231,"""Wasn't it Richard?"" she hurried on.",m
7232,"""Wasn't it Richard Hartley?",m
7233,"Ah, if I could only say it without seeming so contemptibly heartless!",m
7234,If only I needn't say it at all!,m
7235,But it must be said because of what depends upon it.,m
7236,"""Think!",m
7237,Go back to the beginning!,m
7238,Wasn't it Richard who first began to suspect my uncle?,m
7239,"Didn't he tell you or write to you what he had discovered, and so set you upon the right track?",m
7240,"And after you had--well, just fallen into their hands, with no hope of ever escaping, yourself--to say nothing of bringing Arthur back--wasn't it Richard who came to your rescue and brought it all to victory?",m
7241,"Oh, Ste.",m
7242,"Marie, I must be just to him as well as to you!",m
7243,Don't you see that?,m
7244,"However grateful I may be to you for what you have done--suffered--I cannot, in justice, give you what I was to have given you, since it is, after all, Richard who has saved my brother.",m
7245,"I cannot, can I?",m
7246,Surely you must see it.,m
7247,And you must see how it hurts me to have to say it.,m
7248,"I had hoped that--you would understand--without my speaking.""",m
7249,"Still the man sat in his trance of astonishment, speechless.",m
7250,"For the first time in his life he was brought face to face with the amazing, the appalling injustice of which a woman is capable when her heart is concerned.",m
7251,"This girl wished to believe that to Richard Hartley belonged the credit for rescuing her brother, and, lo! she believed it.",m
7252,"A score of juries might have decided against her, a hundred proofs controverted her decision, but she would have been deaf and blind.",m
7253,It is only women who accomplish miracles of reasoning like that.,m
7254,Ste.,m
7255,"Marie took a long breath and he started to speak, but in the end shook his head and remained silent.",m
7256,Through the whirl and din of falling skies he was yet able to see the utter futility of words.,m
7257,He could have adduced a hundred arguments to prove her absurdity.,m
7258,He could have shown her that before he ever read Hartley's note he had decided upon Stewart's guilt--and for much better reasons than Hartley had.,m
7259,"He could have pointed out to her that it was he, not Hartley, who discovered young Benham's whereabouts; that it was he who summoned Hartley there; and that, as a matter of fact, Hartley need not have come at all, since the boy had been persuaded to go home in any case.",m
7260,"He thought of all these things and more, and, in a moment of sheer anger at her injustice, he was on the point of stating them, but he shook his head and remained silent.",m
7261,"After all, of what use was speech?",m
7262,"He knew that it could make no impression upon her, and he knew why.",m
7263,"For some reason, in some way, she had turned, during his absence, to Richard Hartley, and there was nothing more to be said.",m
7264,There was no treachery on Hartley's part.,m
7265,"He knew that, and it never even occurred to him to blame his friend.",m
7266,Hartley was as faithful as any one who ever lived.,m
7267,It seemed to be nobody's fault.,m
7268,It had just happened.,m
7269,"He looked at the girl before him with a new expression, an expression of sheer curiosity.",m
7270,It seemed to him wellnigh incredible that any human being could be so unjust and so blind.,m
7271,"Yet he knew her to be, in other matters, one of the fairest of all women, just and tender and thoughtful and true.",m
7272,He knew that she prided herself upon her cool impartiality of judgment.,m
7273,"He shook his head with a little sigh, and ceased to wonder any more.",m
7274,It was beyond him.,m
7275,"He became aware that he ought to say something, and he said--  ""Yes.",m
7276,"Yes, I--see.",m
7277,I see what you mean.,m
7278,"Yes, Hartley did all you say.",m
7279,I hadn't meant to rob Hartley of the credit he deserves.,m
7280,"I suppose you're right.""",m
7281,"He was possessed of a sudden longing to get away out of that room, and he rose to his feet.",m
7282,"""If you don't mind,"" he said, ""I think I'd better go.",m
7283,"This is--well, it's a bit of a facer, you see.",m
7284,I want to think it over.,m
7285,"Perhaps to-morrow--you don't mind?""",m
7286,"He saw a swift relief flash into Miss Benham's eyes, but she murmured a few words of protest that had a rather perfunctory sound.",m
7287,Ste.,m
7288,Marie shook his head.,m
7289,"""Thanks!",m
7290,"I won't stay,"" said he.",m
7291,"""Not just now.",m
7292,"I--think I'd better go.""",m
7293,"He had a confused realisation of platitudinous adieux, of a silly formality of speech, and he found himself in the hall.",m
7294,"Once he glanced back, and Miss Benham was standing where he had left her, looking after him with a calm and unimpassioned face.",m
7295,He thought that she looked rather like a very beautiful statue.,m

7297,"He moved like a man in a dream, and the things about him seemed to be curiously unreal and rather far away, as they seem sometimes in a fever.",m
7298,"He was admitted at once, and he found the old man sitting up in bed, clad in one of his incredibly gorgeous mandarin's jackets--plum-coloured satin, this time, with peonies--overflowing with spirits and good-humour.",m
7299,His grandson sat in a chair near at hand.,m
7300,"The old man gave a shout of welcome--  ""Ah, here's Jason, at last, back from Colchis.",m
7301,Welcome home to--whatever the name of the place was.,m

7303,He shook Ste.,m
7304,"Marie's hand with hospitable violence, and Ste.",m
7305,Marie was astonished to see upon what a new lease of life and strength the old man seemed to have entered.,m
7306,"There was no ingratitude or misconception here, certainly.",m
7307,Old David quite overwhelmed his visitor with thanks and with expressions of affection.,m
7308,"""You've saved my life among other things!"" he said in his gruff roar.",m

7311,He shook a heavily-waggish head.,m

7314,"Eh, what?",m
7315,"Yes?""",m

7324,"That is to say----""  ""What!"" shouted old David Stewart, in his great voice.",m
7325,"""What is that?""",m
7326,"""Why, it seems,"" said Ste.",m
7327,"Marie, ""it seems that I only blundered.",m
7328,"It seems that Hartley rescued your grandson, not I.  And I suppose he did, you know.",m
7329,"When you come to think of it, I suppose he did.""",m
7330,"David Stewart's great white beard seemed to bristle like the ruff of an angry dog, and his eyes flashed fiercely under their shaggy brows.",m

7332,"Do you mean to tell me that?""",m
7333,"""Well,"" argued Ste.",m

7335,"I did bungle it, didn't I?",m
7336,"It was Hartley who came and pulled us out of the hole.""",m
7337,"""Hartley be damned!"" cried the old man in a towering rage.",m
7338,"And he began to pour out the most extraordinary flood of furious invective upon his granddaughter and upon Richard Hartley, whom he quite unjustly termed a snake-in-the-grass, and finally upon all women, past, contemporary or still to be born.",m
7339,Ste.,m
7340,"Marie, in fear of old David's health, tried to calm him, and the faithful valet came running from the room beyond with prayers and protestations, but nothing would check that astonishing flow of fury until it had run its full course.",m
7341,"Then the man fell back upon his pillows, crimson, panting and exhausted; but the fierce eyes glittered still, and they boded no good for Miss Helen Benham.",m
7342,"""You're well rid of her!"" said the old gentleman, when at last he was once more able to speak.",m
7343,"""You're well rid of her.",m
7344,I congratulate you!,m
7345,"I am ashamed and humiliated, and a great burden of obligation is shifted to me--though I assume it with pleasure--but I congratulate you.",m
7346,"You might have found out too late what sort of a woman she is.""",m
7347,Ste.,m
7348,"Marie began to protest and to explain, and say that Miss Benham had been quite right in what she said, but the old gentleman only waved an impatient arm to him; and presently, when he saw the valet making signs across the bed, and saw that his host was really in a state of complete exhaustion after the outburst, he made his adieux and got away.",m
7349,"Young Arthur Benham, who had been sitting almost silent during the interview, followed him out of the room, and closed the door behind them.",m
7350,For the first time Ste.,m
7351,Marie noted that the boy's face was white and strained.,m
7352,Young Arthur pulled a crumpled square of folded paper from his pocket and shook it at the other man.,m

7354,"""Do you know what's in this?""",m
7355,Ste.,m
7356,"Marie shook his head, but a sudden recollection came to him.",m
7357,"""Ah!"" said he, ""that must be the note Mlle.",m
7358,O'Hara spoke of.,m
7359,She asked me to tell you that she meant it--whatever it may be--quite seriously; that it was final.,m
7360,She didn't explain.,m
7361,"She just said that; that you were to take it as final.""",m
7362,"The lad gave a sudden, very bitter sob.",m
7363,"""She has thrown me over!"" he said.",m
7364,"""She says I'm not to come back to her.""",m
7365,Ste.,m
7366,"Marie gave a wordless cry, and he began to tremble.",m
7367,"""You can read it if you want to,"" the boy said.",m
7368,"""Perhaps you can explain it.",m
7369,I can't.,m
7370,"Do you want to read it?""",m
7371,"The elder man stood staring at him whitely, and the boy repeated his words.",m
7372,"He said--  ""You can read it if you want to,"" and at last Ste.",m
7373,Marie took the paper between stiff hands and held it to the light.,m
7374,Coira O'Hara said briefly that too much was against their marriage.,m
7375,"She mentioned his age, the certain hostility of his family, their different tastes, a number of other things.",m
7376,But in the end she said she had begun to realise that she did not love him as she ought to do if they were to marry.,m
7377,"And so, the note said finally, she gave him up to his family, she released him altogether, and she begged him not to come back to her or to urge her to change her mind.",m
7378,Also she made the trite but very sensible observation that he would be glad of his freedom before the year was out.,m
7379,Ste.,m
7380,"Marie's unsteady fingers opened, and the crumpled paper slipped through them to the floor.",m
7381,Over it the man and the boy looked at each other in silence.,m
7382,"Young Arthur Benham's face was white, and it was strained and contorted with its first grief.",m
7383,But first griefs do not last very long.,m
7384,Coira O'Hara had told the truth; before the year was out the lad would be glad of his freedom.,m
7385,"But the man's face was white also, white and still, and his eyes held a strange expression which the boy could not understand, and at which he wondered.",m
7386,The man was trembling a little from head to foot.,m
7387,"The boy wondered about that too, but abruptly he cried out--  ""What's up?",m
7388,"Where are you going?"" for Ste.",m
7389,Marie had turned all at once and was running down the stairs as fast as he could run.                                                                   In the hall below Ste.,m
7390,"Marie came violently into contact with and nearly overturned Richard Hartley, who was just giving his hat and stick to the man who had admitted him.",m
7391,"Hartley seized upon him with an exclamation of pleasure, and wheeled him round to face the light.",m
7392,"He said--  ""I've been pursuing you all day.",m
7393,You're almost as difficult of access here in Paris as you were at La Lierre.,m
7394,"How's the head?""",m
7395,Ste.,m
7396,Marie put up an experimental hand.,m
7397,He had forgotten his injury.,m
7398,"""Oh, that's all right,"" said he.",m
7399,"""At least I think so.",m
7400,Anderson fixed me up this afternoon.,m
7401,But I haven't time to talk to you.,m
7402,I'm in a hurry.,m
7403,To-morrow we'll have a long chin.,m
7404,"Oh, how about Stewart?""",m
7405,"He lowered his voice, and Hartley answered him in the same tone.",m
7406,"""The man is in a delirium.",m
7407,Heaven knows how it'll end.,m
7408,"He may die, and he may pull through.",m
7409,I hope he pulls through--except for the sake of the family--because then we can make him pay for what he's done.,m
7410,"I don't want him to go scot free by dying.""",m
7411,"""Nor I!"" said Ste.",m
7412,Marie fiercely.,m
7413,"""Nor I!",m
7414,"I want him to pay too--long and slowly and hard, and, if he lives, I shall see that he does it, family or no family.",m
7415,"Now I must be off.""",m
7416,Ste.,m
7417,Marie's face was shining and uplifted.,m
7418,The other man looked at it with a little envious sigh.,m
7419,"""I see everything is all right,"" said he.",m
7420,"""And I congratulate you.",m
7421,"You deserve it if ever any one did.""",m
7422,Ste.,m
7423,Marie stared for an instant uncomprehending.,m
7424,Then he saw.,m
7425,"""Yes,"" he said gently.",m
7426,"""Everything is all right.""",m
7427,It was plain that the Englishman did not know of Miss Benham's decision.,m
7428,He was incapable of deceit.,m
7429,Ste.,m
7430,"Marie threw an arm over his friend's shoulder, and went with him a little way towards the drawing-room.",m
7431,"""Go in there,"" he said.",m
7432,"""You'll find some one glad to see you, I think.",m
7433,"And remember that I said everything is all right.""",m
7434,"He came back after he had turned away, and met Hartley's puzzled frown with a smile.",m
7435,"""If you've that motor here, may I use it?"" he asked.",m
7436,"""I want to go somewhere in a hurry.""",m
7437,"""Of course!"" the other man said.",m
7438,"""Of course!",m
7439,"I'll go home in a cab.""",m
7440,"So they parted, and Ste.",m
7441,Marie went out to the waiting car.,m
7442,"On the left bank the streets are nearly empty of traffic at night, and one can make excellent time over them.",m
7443,Ste.,m
7444,"Marie reached the Porte de Versailles, at the city's limits, in twenty minutes, and dashed through Issy five minutes later.",m
7445,In less than half an hour from the time he had left the Rue de l'Universite he was under the walls of La Lierre.,m
7446,"He looked at his watch, and it was not quite half-past eleven.",m
7447,"He tried the little door in the wall, and it was unlocked, so he passed in and closed the door behind him.",m
7448,"Inside he found that he was running, and he gave a little laugh, but of eagerness and excitement, not of mirth.",m
7449,"There were dim lights in one or two of the upper windows, but none below, and there was no one about.",m
7450,"He pulled at the door bell, and, after a few impatient moments, pulled again and still again.",m
7451,"Then he noticed that the heavy door was ajar, and since no one answered his ringing he pushed the door open and went in.",m
7452,"The lower hall was quite dark, but a very faint light came down from above through the well of the staircase.",m
7453,"He heard dragging feet in the upper hall and then upon one of the upper flights, for the stairs, broad below, divided at a half way landing and continued upward, in an opposite direction, in two narrower flights.",m
7454,"A voice, very faint and weary, called--  ""Who is there?",m
7455,"Who is ringing, please?""",m
7456,"And Coira O'Hara, holding a candle in her hand, came upon the stair landing, and stood gazing down into the darkness.",m
7457,"She wore a sort of dressing gown, a heavy white garment which hung in straight long folds to her feet, and fell away from the arm that held the candle on high.",m
7458,"The yellow beams of light struck down across her head and face, and, even at the distance, the man could see how white she was, and hollow-eyed and worn--a pale wraith of the splendid beauty that had walked in the garden at La Lierre.",m
7459,"""Who is there, please?"" she asked again.",m
7460,"""I can't see.",m
7461,"What is it?""",m
7462,"""It is I, Coira!"" said Ste.",m
7463,"Marie, and she gave a sharp cry.",m
7464,"The arm which was holding the candle overhead shook and fell beside her, as if the strength had gone out of it.",m
7465,"The candle dropped to the floor, spluttered there for an instant, and went out, but there was still a little light from the hall above.",m
7466,Ste.,m
7467,"Marie sprang up the stairs to where the girl stood, and caught her in his arms, for she was on the verge of faintness.",m
7468,"Her head fell back away from him, and he saw her eyes through half-closed lids, her white teeth through parted lips.",m
7469,"She was trembling, but, for that matter, so was he, at the touch of her, the heavy and sweet burden in his arms.",m
7470,"She tried to speak, and he heard a whisper--  ""Why?",m
7471,Why?,m
7472,"Why?""",m
7473,"""Because it is my place, Coira!"" said he.",m
7474,"""Because I cannot live away from you.",m
7475,"Because we belong together.""",m
7476,The girl struggled weakly and pushed against him.,m
7477,"Once more he heard whispering words, and made out that she tried to say--  ""Go back to her!",m
7478,Go back to her!,m
7479,"You belong there.""",m
7480,But at that he laughed aloud.,m
7481,"""I thought so too,"" said he.",m
7482,"""But she thinks otherwise.",m
7483,"She'll have none of me, Coira.",m
7484,It's Richard Hartley now.,m
7485,"Coira, can you love a jilted man?",m

7487,"Her head came up in a flash, and she stared at him, suddenly rigid and tense in his arms.",m
7488,"""Is that true?"" she demanded.",m
7489,"""Yes, my love!"" said he, and she began to weep, with long, comfortable sobs, her face hidden in the hollow of his shoulder.",m
7490,"On one other occasion she had wept before him, and he had been horribly embarrassed, but he bore this present tempest without, as it were, winking.",m
7491,He gloried in it.,m
7492,He tried to say so.,m
7493,"He tried to whisper to her, his lips pressed close to the ear that was nearest them, but he found that he had no speech.",m
7494,"Words would not come to his tongue; it trembled and faltered, and was still for sheer inadequacy.",m
7495,"Rather oddly, in that his thoughts were chaos, swallowed up in the surge of feeling, a memory struck through to him of that other exaltation which had swept him to the stars.",m
7496,"He looked upon it and was amazed because now he saw it, in clear light, for the thing it had been.",m
7497,"He saw it for a fantasy, a self-evoked wraith of the imagination, a dizzy flight of the spirit through spirit space.",m
7498,"He saw that it had not been love at all, and he realised how little a part Helen Benham had ever really played in it.",m
7499,"A cold and still-eyed figure for him to wrap the veil of his imagination round, that was what she had been.",m
7500,"There were times when the sweep of his upward flight had stirred her a little, wakened in her some vague response, but for the most part she had stood aside and looked on, wondering.",m
7501,"The mist was rent away from that rainbow-painted cobweb, and at last the man saw and understood.",m
7502,"He gave an exclamation of wonder, and the girl who loved him raised her head once more, and the two looked each into the other's eyes for a long time.",m
7503,They fell into hushed and broken speech.,m
7504,"""I have loved you so long, so long!"" she said, ""and so hopelessly.",m
7505,I never thought--I never believed.--To think that in the end you have come to me!,m
7506,"I cannot believe it!""",m
7507,"""Wait and see!"" cried the man.",m
7508,"""Wait and see!""",m
7509,She shivered a little.,m
7510,"""If it is not true I should like to die before I find out.",m
7511,"I should like to die now, Bayard, with your arms holding me up, and your eyes close, close.""",m
7512,Ste.,m

7515,"Their two hearts beat one against the other, and they beat very fast.",m
7516,"""Don't you understand,"" he cried, ""that life's only just beginning--day's just dawning, Coira?",m
7517,We've been lost in the dark.,m
7518,Day's coming now.,m
7519,"This is only the sunrise.""",m
7520,"""I can believe it at last,"" she said, ""because you hold me close, and you hurt me a little, and I'm glad to be hurt.",m
7521,And I can feel your heart beating.,m
7522,"Ah, never let me go, Bayard!",m
7523,"I should be lost in the dark again, if you let me go.""",m
7524,"A sudden thought came to her, and she bent back her head to see the better.",m
7525,"""Did you speak with Arthur?""",m
7526,"And he said--  ""Yes.",m
7527,"He asked me to read your note, so I read it.",m
7528,That poor lad!,m
7529,I came straight to you then.,m
7530,"Straight and fast!""",m
7531,"""You knew why I did it?"" she said, and Ste.",m
7532,"Marie said--  ""Now I know.""",m
7533,"""I could not have married him,"" said she.",m
7534,"""I could not.",m
7535,"I never thought I should see you again, but I loved you and I could not have married him.--Ah, impossible!",m
7536,"And he'll be glad, later on.",m
7537,You know that.,m
7538,"It will save him any more trouble with his family, and besides--he's so very young!",m
7539,"Already, I think, he was beginning to chafe a little.",m
7540,I thought so more than once.,m
7541,"""Oh, I'm trying to justify myself!"" she cried.",m
7542,"""I'm trying to find reasons, but you know the true reason.",m
7543,"You know it.""",m
7544,"""I thank God for it!"" he said.",m
7545,"So they stood clinging together in that dim place, and broken whispering speech passed between them or long silences when speech was done.",m
7546,But at last they went down the stairs and out upon the open terrace where the moonlight lay.,m
7547,"""It was in the open sweet air,"" the girl said, ""that we came to know each other.",m

7549,"The house smothers me.""",m
7550,"She looked up when they had passed the west corner of the facade, and drew a little sigh.",m

7552,"""He will not answer me when I call to him, and he has eaten nothing all day long.",m
7553,"Bayard, I think his heart is broken.",m

7556,"They turned down under the trees, where the moonlight made silver splashes about their feet, and the sweet night air bore soft against their faces.",m
7557,"Coira went a half step in advance, her head laid back upon the shoulder of the man she loved, and his arm held her up from falling.",m
7558,"So at last we leave them, walking there in the tender moonlight, with the breath of roses about them, and their eyes turned to the coming day.",m
7559,"It is still night, and there is yet one cloud of sorrow to shadow them somewhat, for upstairs in his locked room a man lies dead across the floor with an empty pistol beside him--heart-broken, as the girl had feared.",m

7718,General Information About Project Gutenberg(tm) electronic works.,m
7719,Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg(tm) concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.,m
7720,"For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg(tm) eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.",m
7721,"Project Gutenberg(tm) eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.",m
7722,"Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.",m
7723,"Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.",m
7724,Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.,m
7725,The replaced older file is renamed.,m
7726,Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.,m
7727,"Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:      http://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg(tm), including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",m
7728,I am in a restless mood to-night.,m
7729,"There seems nothing to explain this, except that perhaps I am growing tired of the life I am leading, or it may be that there are influences at work of which I have no cognizance, but which affect my nerves.",m
7730,"As I look out of my window I can see storm-clouds driven across the wild sky, while distant lights on the heaving sea are suggestive of mystery.",m
7731,"The wind howls around my little wooden tenement, while above the roaring of the waves I can hear the dismal screech of the sea-birds, which, for some reason or other, have left their rocky resting-places.",m
7732,"I do not know why it is, but the cry of the sea-birds is always suggestive of the wail of lost souls as they fly through the infinite spaces.",m
7733,"I did not mean to begin this way at all, for I want, as far as I can, to put all sad thoughts behind me.",m
7734,"Let me begin again then, and, if possible, strike a more cheerful note.",m
7735,"I want something to interest me, and it has struck me that if during these long, dark evenings when I have to be alone I can place on record some of the events which have taken place since I have drifted to this part of the country, I shall be able not only to forget the shadow which hangs over my life, but to see streaks of blue sky amidst the storm-clouds, and to catch the bright rays of the sun which are constantly shining, even although the world says that we are living in a dark time.",m
7736,"But I am writing this also because, as it seems to me, the happenings of the last few months are of sufficient importance to record.",m
7737,"Even although I were sure no one would read what I am going to write, I should still go on writing.",m
7738,"Some one has said, I do not know who, that the life of a village is the life of a nation in miniature; and even although that may contain only a suggestion of the truth, certain am I that if I can faithfully record the events which have taken place in the little village of St.",m
7739,"Issey, I shall have written something of the history of the great world outside.",m
7740,"Now that I have started writing, however, I immediately realize that, if I am to make my narrative comprehensible, I shall have to give some kind of personal explanation.",m
7741,"Who am I, where am I, and why am I here?",m
7742,"I promised just now that I would, as far as possible, avoid the sad things of life and dwell on the sunshine rather than on the shadow.",m
7743,But why should I?,m
7744,"Life is made up of sunshine and shadow, and no one can give a faithful account of life without dwelling on both.",m
7745,"Besides, what are the things we call sorrow and joy but contrasts?",m
7746,And life without contrasts would be unbearable.,m
7747,"I will tell my story just as it is, then: its light and its shade; its hope and its despair.",m
7748,"*       *       *       *       *  ""Simpson,"" I said to my one servant and factotum, who has been with me for several years, and whom I regard more in the light of a friend and counsellor than as a paid hireling, ""the doctor tells me that I have at most a year to live.""",m
7749,I was sitting in my chambers in London as I mentioned this interesting piece of information.,m
7750,Simpson had just placed my coffee and bacon before me.,m
7751,"He stopped suddenly as I spoke, as though the news had startled him.",m
7752,Then he went on with his work.,m
7753,"""I beg your pardon, sir.""",m
7754,I repeated the information.,m
7755,"""The doctor tells me I have at most a year to live.",m
7756,I may not last so long.,m
7757,"Possibly a month will see the end of me.""",m
7758,"I thought Simpson's hand trembled, but he repeated the formula which had almost become second nature to him:  ""Yes, sir; thank you, sir,"" he said.",m
7759,"""I have been thinking, Simpson,"" I went on, ""that as I have but such a short time before me in this world I may as well spend it comfortably and in a congenial place; indeed, the doctor insists that I should.""",m
7760,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.",m
7761,"Is there anything more you want, sir?""",m
7762,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""you don't appear to believe I am serious.",m
7763,I am simply telling you what Dr. Rhomboid told me last night.,m
7764,"By the way, how did he ever get the name of Rhomboid?",m
7765,"A rhomboid has something to do with mathematics, hasn't it?""",m
7766,To this Simpson made no reply.,m
7767,"""How long did you say, sir, that the doctor gave you?"" he asked presently.",m
7768,He seemed by this time to have quite recovered himself.,m
7769,"""He is of opinion that a year at the outside will see the end of me,"" was my reply, ""but it may be that I shall only last a month or two.",m
7770,There is something wrong with my inside.,m
7771,"He gave it some sort of a name, but I won't try to repeat it.",m
7772,I might pronounce it wrongly.,m
7773,"But why do you ask?""",m
7774,"""Well, sir, you have got an important case on, and I heard that it would last a long time.",m
7775,"It would be a pity if you didn't live to see the end of it.""",m
7776,"""I shall have to drop the case, Simpson,"" I said.",m
7777,"""What, Mr. Francis, drop the case?",m
7778,"That would be a terrible pity, and you having had to wait so long for cases, too.""",m
7779,"""You seem more interested in the case than in the tenure of my existence, Simpson,"" was my response.",m
7780,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir,"" replied Simpson, after hesitating some seconds.",m
7781,"""How long have you been with me, Simpson?""",m
7782,I asked.,m
7783,"""Ever since you went to Oxford, sir--eleven years ago last October.""",m
7784,"""That is a long time, Simpson.""",m
7785,"""Yes, Mr. Francis.",m
7786,"Your father--that is, Mr. Erskine--made me promise that I would stick to you.",m
7787,"That was before he died, sir.""",m
7788,"I may here remark that my father, John Erskine, died just as I left Winchester.",m
7789,He did not make any fuss about dying.,m
7790,"He simply called me to his side and said, ""Frank, I have sent you to a good school, and you have done very well.",m
7791,"I have left you enough money to go to Oxford, where I want you to take a good law degree.",m
7792,"After that, I want you to read for the Bar, and, if possible, rise to be Lord Chancellor.",m
7793,"There will not be very much money left when you finish at Oxford--something over a thousand pounds, I believe; but that should last you until your briefs begin to come in.",m
7794,"Simpson, our old servant, will go with you.",m
7795,"I think that is all, my boy.""",m
7796,"The next day my father died, and I, as arranged, took Simpson to Oxford with me.",m
7797,"Simpson is not very handsome, but he is a very valuable friend, and in his way has glimmerings of sense.",m
7798,"I toyed with my breakfast, for although I spoke calmly enough about it, I was not altogether pleased at the idea of dying so soon.",m
7799,"After all, I was only just thirty, and, as Simpson had said, the briefs had only just begun to come in.",m
7800,"""I beg your pardon, Mr. Francis, but will you be leaving London soon?""",m
7801,"""I have decided to leave at once,"" I replied, ""but the question with me is, Where shall I go?",m
7802,"I have been thinking a good deal about it during the night, and I cannot decide.",m
7803,"Where would you suggest?""",m
7804,"""Well, Mr. Francis,"" replied Simpson, ""if you will forgive me for making a suggestion, sir, I should say that, as yours is a Cornish family, Cornwall would be a suitable place to----""  Here he stopped, and seemed in a difficulty as to how he should conclude the sentence.",m
7805,"""That is, sir,"" he went on, ""would it not be appropriate?""",m
7806,"""Exactly,"" was my answer.",m
7807,"""Cornwall it shall be, then; but I don't know Cornwall, although, as you say, I am of Cornish stock.",m
7808,"You are also Cornish, Simpson?""",m
7809,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
7810,"""I have been looking through my accounts,"" I went on, ""and I find that by economy I can manage to pay my way for about a year.",m
7811,"That fits in exactly, as you see; but I am afraid it won't include you, Simpson.",m
7812,"You have rather a good appetite.""",m
7813,"""My appetite can depend very much on the state of your funds, Mr. Francis,"" he replied.",m
7814,"""That means you are inclined to go with me?""",m
7815,"""Certainly, sir;",m
7816,"I could not think of leaving you alone.""",m
7817,"I confess that I was somewhat relieved at this, because, although I determined to put a brave face upon everything, the thought of spending my last days alone was not pleasant.",m
7818,"""That is awfully good of you, Simpson,"" I remarked, ""but if you come with me, although, as you say, your appetite can be regulated, we shall have to be careful.",m
7819,"I like your idea of going to Cornwall, but I don't know what part of the Delectable Duchy to go to.",m
7820,"The doctor suggests that, in order to extend my existence as long as possible, I ought to go to some spot where the air is warm, yet bracing; that I must have no excitement, but at the same time must have interesting and pleasant companionship; that, while I ought to be out of the world, I must at the same time be in it.",m
7821,"This fellow with a mathematical name seems to be intensely unreasonable.""",m
7822,"""Excuse me, sir, but could you give me a short holiday?"" asked Simpson.",m
7823,"""For how long?""",m
7824,"""Say four days, sir.",m
7825,"I will arrange for you to be well cared for while I am gone, sir.""",m
7826,"I didn't ask Simpson why he wished to go away, or where he was going.",m
7827,I am afraid at that moment I hadn't sufficient interest to inquire.,m
7828,"Of course, I gave my consent, and that same day Simpson packed up his bag and left me.",m
7829,"Here was I, then, Francis Erskine, aged thirty, barrister-at-law, member of the Inner Temple, who, a week before, had good prospects, alone, with my death-warrant signed.",m
7830,"I hadn't felt very well for some time, but had paid no heed to my ailments.",m
7831,"For the past twelve months I had been, for a young barrister, very busy.",m
7832,It so happened that I had been engaged upon a case which appeared hopeless.,m
7833,"All my brothers at the Bar declared that my client had not the ghost of a chance, and then, by what people called a stroke of genius on my part, but which was really a pure fluke, I carried off the thing triumphantly.",m
7834,"From that time briefs came in fairly rapidly, and I was more than once referred to as a rising young man of brilliant parts.",m
7835,"Then came the doctor's verdict, and there was an end to everything.",m
7836,What I did during Simpson's absence I cannot remember.,m
7837,"I tried to take a philosophical view of the situation, and although the disease from which I suffered was, the doctor declared, past all cure, and had made great ravages upon my constitution, I went about as usual.",m
7838,"After all, what was the use of bothering about death?",m
7839,At the end of four days Simpson came back.,m
7840,"I thought he appeared somewhat excited, but his manner was quiet and respectful as usual.",m
7841,"""Enjoyed your holiday, Simpson?""",m
7842,I asked.,m
7843,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.",m
7844,"When will you be ready to start, sir?""",m
7845,"""My tenancy of these chambers expires in three days, Simpson.""",m
7846,"""I hope Mrs. Blandy looked after you all right while I was away, sir?""",m
7847,"""I really don't remember,"" was my reply.",m
7848,"""I dare say.""",m
7849,"""Could you start to-morrow morning, sir?",m
7850,"I can get everything ready by that time.""",m
7851,"""Where are we going, Simpson?""",m
7852,I asked.,m
7853,He looked at me as if in surprise.,m
7854,"""To Cornwall, sir.""",m
7855,"""You have made arrangements for me, then?""",m
7856,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
7857,I did not ask him any further questions.,m
7858,I did not think it worth while.,m
7859,"After all, when one came to reflect, nothing was worth while.",m
7860,"If Simpson had suggested the Highlands of Scotland or the Flats of Essex, I should have made no demur.",m
7861,"On the whole, however, I was pleased that we were going to Cornwall.",m
7862,"Both my father and mother were Cornish people, and although I had never visited the country, it seemed less disagreeable to me to go there and spend my few remaining days than to any other place.",m
7863,"I knew that Cornwall was a narrow strip of land at the extreme west of the country, and I had heard vague reports about the fine coast-line and beautiful air, but, beyond that, very little.",m
7864,"""Perhaps, sir,"" said Simpson, ""we had better put off our journey until the day after to-morrow.""",m
7865,"""Why?""",m
7866,I asked.,m
7867,"""You will want to say good-bye to your friends, won't you, sir?""",m
7868,"""I think I have a remembrance of doing that, Simpson,"" I replied.",m
7869,"""You have a lot of friends here, haven't you?",m
7870,"Excuse me for asking, sir.""",m
7871,"""I have a lot of acquaintances, Simpson,"" I replied, ""but only two friends--Bill Tremain and Tom Esmond.",m
7872,The rest don't count.,m
7873,"I should not be surprised if they came to see me when I am in Cornwall--that is, if their wives will allow them.",m
7874,"Have you ever reflected, Simpson, that marriage is a tremendous hindrance to friendship?",m
7875,"Wives always make it difficult.""",m
7876,"""Excuse me, sir, but what a pity it is you have not got a wife.""",m
7877,"""I have never regarded the matter in that light, Simpson.",m
7878,"Why do you say so?""",m
7879,"""Women always save a man from brooding.",m
7880,"They never give him a chance of being quiet, sir,"" and Simpson shook his head impressively.",m
7881,"""You speak as one having authority.",m
7882,"Have you ever been married?""",m
7883,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Simpson.",m
7884,"""I didn't know that.",m
7885,Why have you never told me?,m
7886,"How long were you married?""",m
7887,"""Two years, sir.",m
7888,"I never talk about those two years, but I shall never forget them.""",m
7889,"I asked Simpson several questions, but his replies did not contain much information.",m
7890,"""You don't seem to be very communicative with regard to your married life.""",m
7891,"""There's nothing to say, sir, besides what I told you.",m
7892,Women save a man from brooding.,m
7893,"You see, sir, they don't give him time to brood.",m
7894,"I have never noticed that you have paid much attention to young ladies.""",m
7895,"""Not very much,"" I replied.",m
7896,"""I don't seem to have had time.",m
7897,"I have always been too busy with my work.""",m
7898,"""If you had married, sir--at least, if you had married the woman I did--you would never have had any time for your work.""",m
7899,"Next morning I found that all my bags were packed, while a taxi stood at the door.",m
7900,I made no inquiries as to Simpson's intentions or plans.,m
7901,When he went to the booking-office at Paddington I did not even ask him the name of the station for which he was booking.,m
7902,"I remember entering a first-class carriage, where Simpson made me as comfortable as possible, after which I saw him talking to the guard, and heard him tell that worthy official that I must not be disturbed if it could possibly be helped.",m
7903,Of my journey to Cornwall I remember practically nothing.,m
7904,I think I slept a great part of the distance.,m
7905,"Towards evening we stopped at a little wayside station, where Simpson appeared and told me I was to alight.",m
7906,"""Have we come to our journey's end?""",m
7907,I asked.,m
7908,"""To the end of the railway journey,"" was his reply.",m
7909,"""I seem to smell the sea, Simpson,"" I said.",m
7910,"""Yes, sir, we are close to the sea.""",m
7911,"He led the way to the station-yard, where a carriage stood, evidently waiting for me.",m
7912,"This I entered, while Simpson, after attending to the luggage, and expressing the hope that he was not inconveniencing me, took his seat by my side.",m
7913,Once in the carriage I began to take more interest in my surroundings.,m
7914,"I saw that we were in a beautifully wooded country, while away in the distance rose giant hills and rocky tors.",m
7915,"I heard the roll of the waves, too, while the air was like some life-giving elixir.",m
7916,"Presently we entered a village, which nestled among the trees.",m
7917,"""Simpson,"" I asked, ""what is the name of this village?""",m
7918,"""This is St.",m
7919,"Issey, sir.""",m
7920,"""It is a very pretty place.""",m
7921,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
7922,"I saw a number of cottages, built in higgledy-piggledy fashion, each surrounded by its own garden.",m
7923,"I saw the villagers standing gossiping with each other, heard the laughter of little children as they played in the lane, smelt the sweetness and purity of the air.",m
7924,"After all, it was good to live.",m
7925,"""Is there no hotel here?""",m
7926,I asked.,m
7927,"""No, sir; no hotel, sir.""",m
7928,"I did not ask him where we were going, or how I was to be accommodated.",m
7929,"After all, it was not worth while.",m
7930,One place was as good as another.,m
7931,"We passed some lodge gates, which evidently appertained to a big house, and I noted the great granite pillars and the heavy palisading.",m
7932,"""The Squire of the parish lives there, I suppose?""",m
7933,"""Yes, sir, Squire Treherne.",m
7934,"That, sir,"" pointing to a comfortable-looking house which stood back from the road, ""is the Vicarage.",m
7935,Mr. Trelaske lives there.,m
7936,"And that, sir, is the Wesleyan Chapel.",m
7937,"I am of the Wesleyan persuasion myself--at least, I was when I was a boy.""",m
7938,"""That is a long time ago, Simpson.""",m
7939,"""I am fifty-five, sir, but it doesn't seem long since I was a boy--that is, except for those two years when I was married; those seem very long.""",m
7940,Simpson's face looked so comical that I could not help laughing.,m
7941,It was the first time I had laughed since my interview with the doctor.,m
7942,"We passed by a great square tower and a low, many-gabled church, with the churchyard around it.",m
7943,I turned my eyes away.,m
7944,The place was not pleasant to me.,m
7945,"Presently we began to descend a steep hill, and the sound of the waves rolling upon a hard and sandy beach became more and more clear.",m
7946,"The carriage entered a narrow lane, which ended in a kind of copse close to a rugged cliff.",m
7947,"A little later I saw, built within a few feet from the edge of the cliff, a wooden house.",m
7948,"At the back of it a steep and almost precipitous piece of country, covered with brushwood, rose skyward.",m
7949,In front was the Atlantic.,m
7950,The house was in a bay looking towards the sea.,m
7951,"The cliffs on the right side were not very high, but on the left they rose up almost perpendicular, rugged and imposing.",m
7952,"I noticed that the rocks of which the cliffs were composed were in one place discolored, and I pointed it out.",m
7953,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Simpson.",m
7954,"""When I was a boy there was a copper-mine here.",m
7955,"There's a level under the hill now--at least, I believe so, sir.",m
7956,"This is the house I have settled on, sir.""",m
7957,I alighted from the carriage and looked more closely at what was to be my future dwelling.,m
7958,"As I have said, it was a wooden erection, and was evidently built with some care.",m
7959,"All along the front was a veranda, the floor of which was roughly paved with granite slabs.",m
7960,"The few yards of land between the veranda and the edge of the cliff had been cultivated, and flowers grew in wild profusion.",m
7961,At the back of the house many kinds of wild flowers bloomed.,m
7962,"In the near distance, on the top of the cliffs, the land was covered with furze bushes and heather.",m
7963,I stood and took a deep breath and listened while the waves rolled on the golden sand hundreds of feet down.,m
7964,"""Won't you come into the house, sir?"" asked Simpson.",m
7965,"""I have paid the driver, and there is a man coming along with the luggage in a cart.""",m
7966,"""Not yet,"" I replied.",m
7967,"""I want to take my fill of this.",m
7968,This is wonderful--simply wonderful.,m
7969,"I want to live.""",m
7970,Simpson stood watching me.,m
7971,I thought I saw his lips tremble.,m
7972,II  MY NEW HOME   I liked the house the moment I entered it.,m
7973,"It was snug, cozy, and warm.",m
7974,"It had the feeling of home, too, and felt so quiet and restful that I threw myself into an armchair with a sigh of relief.",m
7975,"""You spent your holiday in getting this, I suppose, Simpson?""",m
7976,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.",m
7977,"I hope you like it, sir.",m
7978,"It is not altogether what I would like, sir, but directly I saw it I thought it would suit you.""",m
7979,"""To whom does it belong, Simpson?""",m
7980,"""Well, sir, I would rather not tell you, if you don't mind.",m
7981,"You may rest assured that I got it on favorable terms, and everything is in order.""",m
7982,"""But I do mind,"" I said, for by this time I had quite an interest in my surroundings.",m
7983,"For days nothing had seemed to matter, but now I was quite eager to know how Simpson had happened upon this quaint yet comfortable place.",m
7984,"""You are sure you wish me to tell you, sir?"" and Simpson looked at me almost beseechingly.",m
7985,"""I insist on it,"" I replied.",m
7986,"""Well, sir, I am afraid it was built by a kind of madman who came down to St.",m
7987,Issey about six years ago.,m
7988,Who he was I don't know.,m
7989,No one seems to know.,m
7990,"But he took a lease of this piece of ground from the Squire and built the house with his own hands.""",m
7991,"""He must have been a carpenter,"" I suggested.",m
7992,"""It seems very well built.",m
7993,"But what has become of him?""",m
7994,"""He is dead, sir.""",m
7995,"""Was he old or young?""",m
7996,"""Quite an old man, I think, sir.",m
7997,"Anyhow, he built it himself and would have no one near him.",m
7998,"After it was built he lived here alone for several years, speaking to no one but the village idiot, who went by the name of Fever Lurgy, who bought all his food and did all his errands.",m
7999,"No woman was allowed near the place, sir.""",m
8000,"""Then he cooked his own food and did his own house-work?""",m
8001,I asked.,m
8002,"""It would appear so, sir.",m
8003,"He seems to have made himself very comfortable, too.",m
8004,"As you see, the furniture is not at all bad, and nearly everything is just as he left it.""",m
8005,I must confess to being interested.,m
8006,The thought of a man coming to this place and building a house for himself and living there without companionship of any sort appealed to me.,m
8007,I wondered how he spent his days and nights.,m
8008,"""Let me have a look around the place,"" I said, rising from the chair.",m
8009,"""I want to see what rooms it contains.""",m
8010,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir,"" was Simpson's reply.",m
8011,"The room in which I had been sitting was about fifteen feet square--it might be a little more--and looked out upon the veranda, beyond which stretched the great Atlantic.",m
8012,"It was comfortably furnished, and possessed an old-fashioned fireplace, evidently intended for logs of wood, and revealed the fact that the builder was not only ingenious in the matter of house-building, but that he possessed a good deal of taste.",m
8013,"The whole apartment was carefully match-boarded, and was, as I said, snug and comfortable.",m
8014,"""This, sir, is the bedroom,"" said Simpson, opening the door at the end of the living apartment.",m
8015,"It was much smaller than the other, but quite big enough for a single bed, together with the simple necessities of a man living alone.",m
8016,"""And did he die here?""",m
8017,I asked.,m
8018,"""Yes, sir; no, sir--that is--I don't know, sir.""",m
8019,"""What do you mean, Simpson?""",m
8020,"""Well, sir, that is why I didn't want to tell you about him; but there are all sorts of stories afloat.",m
8021,"You don't mind, do you, sir?""",m
8022,"""Not a bit,"" I replied.",m
8023,"""Whatever my ailments are, nerves don't trouble me.""",m
8024,"""Well, sir,"" went on Simpson, ""the fact that he lived here all alone caused people to talk about him--especially the women.",m
8025,"You know what women are, sir, and people used to come and look from the hill above and see what he was doing.",m
8026,"One day two women were bold enough to come close to the place, and they knocked at the door.",m
8027,"There was no answer, sir.",m
8028,They knocked again and again and made a great noise.,m
8029,Still there was no answer.,m
8030,Then they rushed away to St.,m
8031,Issey and gave it as their opinion that something had happened to him.,m
8032,"They hadn't been back in the village more than half an hour when Fever Lurgy came, pale as a ghost, and trembling like a leaf.",m
8033,"He had gone to inquire whether he was needed for errands, and, on being unable to make any one hear, had burst open the door.",m
8034,In this bedroom he found evidences of a great struggle.,m
8035,"He found blood, too, but the man was nowhere to be seen.""",m
8036,"""That's interesting,"" I said.",m
8037,"""What was the name by which this old fellow was known?""",m
8038,"""Fever Lurgy called him Father Abraham,"" was Simpson's reply.",m
8039,"""Well, go on,"" I urged.",m
8040,"""There's nothing more to tell you, sir.",m
8041,From that day he has never been seen.,m
8042,"People believe, however, he was murdered here; that some tramps came and found him alone, stole his money, killed him, and threw his body over the cliff.""",m
8043,"""And how long was this ago?""",m
8044,"""About four months, sir.""",m
8045,"""And since that time no one has lived here?""",m
8046,"""No, sir, no one.",m
8047,Most people have been afraid to come near the place.,m
8048,"That is why none of the things have been touched; besides, the Squire, as soon as he discovered what had taken place, told his men to keep an eye on it.""",m
8049,"""And so you thought, Simpson,"" I said, ""that this was the sort of place I would like to come to and end my days?""",m
8050,"""Well, Mr. Francis,"" was Simpson's response, ""for one thing you told me you wanted a place that was cheap, that you wanted a place that was out of the world and yet in the world, and I immediately thought of St.",m
8051,Issey.,m
8052,"When I came down here, however, I found that any lodgings you might like would be rather dear, and then, hearing of this place, I determined to come and see it.""",m
8053,Here Simpson stopped.,m
8054,"""That's not quite answering my question, Simpson,"" I remarked.",m
8055,"""Well, sir, I have not lived with you going on for twelve years without knowing something of the kind of gentleman you are.",m
8056,"I have never known you trouble once, sir, about ghosts or anything of that sort, while your nerves have always been as steady as old time.",m
8057,"Besides, I was able to get it dirt cheap, sir--in fact, the Squire's steward was glad to have it tenanted at any price.",m
8058,"The place is very pretty, too, sir.",m
8059,"There is not a finer view along the coast of Cornwall, and that is saying a great deal.",m
8060,"It is out of the world, and it is only half a mile from the village.",m
8061,"Still, sir, if you don't like it, we can easily leave.",m
8062,Over at St.,m
8063,"Eia there's a nice cheap hotel where----""  ""Hang the hotel,"" I interposed.",m
8064,"""I am going to stay here.""",m
8065,"""I think I ought to tell you, sir,"" went on Simpson imperturbably, ""that people say they have heard curious noises around here of a night, and it is believed by many that the ghost of Father Abraham haunts the place.""",m
8066,Simpson looked so solemn as he said this that I laughed again.,m
8067,"I don't know why it was, but, in spite of his dreary story, my spirits rose unaccountably.",m
8068,"""The ghost of Father Abraham doesn't trouble me a bit, Simpson,"" I said.",m
8069,"""This place suits me down to the ground.",m
8070,But this is not all?,m
8071,"Surely there must be a kitchen somewhere.""",m
8072,"""Oh yes, sir.",m
8073,"This way, sir,"" and Simpson spoke quite eagerly.",m
8074,Evidently my approval of his choice removed a load from his mind.,m
8075,"Father Abraham had evidently determined to make himself comfortable, for the kitchen, though small, seemed to have every requisite.",m
8076,"As I entered it, an old woman rose from her chair and curtsied in the old time-honored way.",m
8077,"""This,"" said Simpson, ""is Mrs. Martha Bray.",m
8078,"I asked her to come in and make everything spotlessly clean for you by the time you came.""",m
8079,"""And Mrs. Martha Bray has obeyed orders,"" I remarked.",m
8080,"""Everything is as perfect as a new pin.",m
8081,"But, Simpson,"" I continued, ""where will you sleep?""",m
8082,"""There's a little place here behind, sir, where I have made up a bed for myself,"" replied Simpson.",m
8083,"""It will be nice and handy for my work.""",m
8084,"""Yes, sur, and plase, sur, I can come in an' help 'ee any time,"" remarked Martha Bray.",m
8085,"""I do'ant live fur away, an' I can come 'cross the fields in a few minutes.""",m
8086,"""Excuse me, Martha,"" was Simpson's rejoinder, ""but we shall need no one.",m
8087,"I can do all that is necessary for Mr. Francis.""",m
8088,"""Oh, plase yerself,"" replied the old woman, ""but it'll be ter'ble wisht for 'ee doin' everything yerself without a woman to help 'ee.",m
8089,I do always say that a man wethout a woman to do his chores for en es like one side to a pair of scissors.,m
8090,"I have got some tay ready, sur, and I have toasted a piece of ham rasher.",m
8091,"It's raal ham, too, not like the stuff you buy in the shops.",m
8092,"I do'ant hold with these new-fashioned notions about feedin' pigs, and do always feed mine meself like my mother and grandmother used to do before me.",m
8093,"And you'll find, sur, that tes deffrent from the ham you do buy in the shops.",m
8094,"My b'lief, sur, es that ef old Father Abram had had a woman to look after en, he wouldn't be dead now.""",m
8095,"Having delivered herself of this long speech, the old woman curtsied once more, and prepared to take my meal into the little living-room.",m
8096,"""Excuse me, Martha, I will do that,"" said Simpson, ""and there's no reason why we should detain you any longer.",m
8097,"Here are your wages, and thank you for what you have done.""",m
8098,"""All right,"" said Martha.",m
8099,"""Ef you can do without me, I can do without you.",m
8100,The tay is in the caddy up there.,m
8101,"There's some bread in the cupboard there, and the other things be in this drawer.",m
8102,"Good-night, sur.",m
8103,"I will look over again to see whether there is anything I can do for 'ee.""",m
8104,"I returned to the sitting-room, and sat while Simpson prepared my evening meal.",m
8105,"""I want to wash, Simpson,"" I said, when he had nearly completed his work.",m
8106,"""Besides, it has struck me that there is no such thing as a bathroom in the house.",m
8107,"What are we going to do?""",m
8108,"""This way, sir,"" said Simpson, and I followed him out of the house towards what I call the cliff end of the building.",m
8109,"Here I found, gurgling out of the hillside, a stream of the purest water I had ever seen, which flowed into a pond.",m
8110,"The idea of outdoor ablutions appealed to me, and I almost forgot my ailments as I bathed my hands and face in the pure spring water.",m
8111,"A few minutes later, I was eating the sweetest ham I had ever tasted.",m
8112,"""If this is the result of the old-fashioned way of feeding pigs,"" I remarked to Simpson, ""I shall make a closer acquaintance with Mrs. Martha Bray, and shall buy all the hams she can dispose of.""",m
8113,The time was spring.,m
8114,"To be exact, it was the 14th of May, and although the evening air was somewhat chilly, the days had become long, and I remembered standing a long time at the front of my little wooden hut, looking at the giant cliffs at whose feet the waves of the broad Atlantic rolled.",m
8115,"When I had returned to the house, Simpson had lit a lamp, while in the grate a wood fire burnt cheerfully.",m
8116,"""Do you think it will do, sir?"" asked Simpson.",m
8117,"""Do!""",m
8118,I replied;,m
8119,"""it's just perfect.""",m
8120,"""Then, sir, if you don't mind, I will go to bed.",m

8123,"""Nothing, thank you, Simpson.",m
8124,"Good-night.""",m
8125,"A few minutes later I judged, from the silence which prevailed in the kitchen, that Simpson had retired, and that I was practically alone in the little wooden hut.",m
8126,"I was still in utter ignorance of my whereabouts, beyond the fact that I was somewhere in Cornwall on the edge of a cliff, and close to a little village called St.",m
8127,Issey.,m
8128,Where St.,m
8129,Issey was situated I did not know.,m
8130,"Cornwall, I reflected, was a county nearly a hundred miles long, with the main portion of it surrounded by the sea.",m
8131,"I knew that I must be somewhere in the vicinity of the main line of the Great Western Railway, as I did not remember changing anywhere, but beyond that I had little or no knowledge.",m
8132,"Still, this did not trouble me.",m
8133,"I reflected upon what Simpson had told me concerning the cheapness of my place of residence, and I had absolute trust in him concerning all arrangements for the future.",m
8134,"The night was very quiet, I remember.",m
8135,"Scarcely a breath of wind stirred, although the air which came into my open window was pure and exhilarating.",m
8136,"The splash of the waves was still heard on the sandy beach, although I judged the tide had receded somewhat.",m
8137,"Now and then the cry of a disturbed sea-bird reached me, but beyond that, nothing.",m
8138,Somehow I could not make up my mind to turn in for the night.,m
8139,"I had too many things to think about, while my new surroundings drove away all desire for sleep.",m
8140,"I took one of the books I had brought with me from London, and tried to read, but that was impossible.",m
8141,I could not scan a dozen lines without my mind wandering from the printed pages.,m
8142,"After all, when one comes to think about it, my position was somewhat strange.",m
8143,"It is easy to talk about coming to a place to die; but when one has actually heard the death sentence pronounced, and is told that, at the most, he cannot live more than a year, it is not a pleasant experience, and, in spite of all my endeavors, my thoughts were constantly reverting to Dr. Rhomboid's verdict.",m
8144,"Presently I could bear my thoughts no longer, and, quietly opening the door, I went out into the night.",m
8145,"How still, how solemn it was!",m
8146,"On my left hand the great beetling, rugged cliffs rose, imposing and awe-inspiring.",m
8147,"Behind me, the hillside rose steep and high.",m
8148,In front was the wide Atlantic.,m
8149,I could see the waves breaking into foam some little distance from the shore.,m
8150,"I could, in the pale light of the moon, see the discolorment in one place in the rocks, which reminded me of the mine which Simpson had told me was working there when he was a boy.",m
8151,"How long I stood there I do not know, but presently, in the silence of the night, I heard a cry.",m
8152,"It might be that of a sea-bird, although it made me think of other things.",m
8153,"A little later I heard what might be described as a moan, although that does not truly convey the impression it made upon me.",m
8154,"In spite of myself, my mind reverted to the story which Simpson had told me about the man who had built the house, and of his supposed tragic end.",m
8155,"Could it be, I wondered, that this man's spirit visited the scene of his death, drawn there by some laws yet undiscovered by the student of psychic phenomena?",m
8156,"I had no superstitious fears; indeed, I had no belief in a life beyond this present existence.",m
8157,"If ever I had believed in this, the belief had died years before.",m
8158,In a vague kind of way I imagined that death was the end of everything.,m
8159,Perhaps that was why the doctor's verdict was so grim and forbidding.,m
8160,"I heard another cry, not loud, but quite distinct; and then I thought I saw forms moving along at the base of the cliff some little distance away, but the moon, which was on the wane, gave me insufficient light to be certain.",m
8161,"A cloud passed over the sky, and then I could see nothing.",m
8162,"""Surely I could not be mistaken,"" I said to myself, ""yet who could be crawling along at the base of the cliffs?",m
8163,"No. It was all pure fancy.""",m
8164,"As if in contradiction of my thoughts, however, I heard noises which seemed to be directly under my feet.",m
8165,"These noises seemed to continue for three or four minutes, and then all was silence.",m
8166,"""Events have been too much for me,"" I reflected, ""and in spite of all my boasting about my nerves, they are playing me tricks.""",m
8167,"I turned and looked at the little house, and I doubted whether, in spite of all my brave words, I should be able to continue living there.",m
8168,"To be alone day after day and night after night, with no one to speak to me and no one to care for me, save this unimaginative man, was, to say the least of it, anything but exhilarating.",m
8169,"Then I felt the gnawing, deadly pain which had led me to visit Dr. Rhomboid.",m
8170,"""I must not be a fool,"" I reflected.",m
8171,"""What has to be has to be, and I must go through with it.",m
8172,"Besides, one place is as good as another.",m
8173,"I will go to bed.""",m
8174,"All the same, I made up my mind that I would not live like a hermit, and that I would become acquainted with the life of this little village into which I had been cast.",m
8175,"III  THE CHURCHES' ANSWER   I suppose my long journey must have tired me, for I slept soundly, and on the following morning when I awoke the sun was shining through the windows, while the splash of the waves sounded pleasantly to my ears.",m
8176,A few minutes later I was up and dressed.,m
8177,"Walking to the edge of the cliff, I looked towards the spot where, the previous night, I fancied I had seen dim forms moving; but in the light of the sun nothing was visible.",m
8178,"The shadows, too, of a few hours before had entirely passed away.",m
8179,"The fresh, pure spring air exhilarated me in spite of myself.",m
8180,I almost forgot Dr. Rhomboid's verdict.,m
8181,"Indeed, so far did I ignore his instructions that I found my way to the highest point of the cliff and looked seaward.",m
8182,Never in my whole life had I been so entranced as on that morning.,m
8183,The blue sky was reflected in the water in such a way that I felt I had never really seen the sea until then.,m
8184,To the right and to the left of me stretched the giant cliffs until they were lost in the horizon.,m
8185,At their feet rolled great waves.,m
8186,"Landward, hill rose upon hill, and the whole countryside was fast assuming its garments of summer glory.",m
8187,"In a sense, Cornwall did not seem a beautiful county to me at all.",m
8188,"At least, it did not possess the beauty I had expected.",m
8189,"Compared with Surrey, it looked bare, and in some senses almost drear, and yet it possessed a charm which I could associate with no other place.",m
8190,"There was something in the air one breathed, some strange charm, something in the very essence of the county which differentiated it from the rest of the world.",m
8191,Cornwall is as different from other counties as England is different from Spain.,m
8192,"I felt my blood tingle as I looked, and realized that a mysterious hand had been laid upon me.",m
8193,"Perhaps it was because there was Cornish blood in my veins, and that for many generations my ancestors had lived amidst associations similar to these.",m
8194,"In any case, my heart thrilled its recognition, and I knew that I was a part of what I saw, that the spirit of my county was speaking to me, and that the innermost depths of my being realized my homeland.",m
8195,"Years seemed to slip from me, and with a recrudescence of youth came a passionate desire for life--more life.",m
8196,"While I had been in London I seemed to be largely indifferent to the doctor's pronouncement, even although I was beginning to sip from the goblet of the world's success.",m
8197,"But a numbness had possessed my being, and I had been able to speculate grimly upon my approaching demise.",m
8198,"Now, however, it was different.",m
8199,"The world seemed wider, the sky higher, and life promised infinite things.",m
8200,"I could not formulate them into words; nevertheless, they surged up in my being like a mighty torrent, and I longed to live.",m
8201,"My whole soul revolted against cessation of life, and all the time I knew that a dread disease was slowly working within me.",m
8202,But I would not think of it.,m
8203,"By an effort I threw my forebodings from me, and, seeing a precipitous pathway down to the beach, made my way thitherward.",m
8204,I wanted to interest myself in the happenings of the world.,m
8205,"A little later I found my way to the base of the cliffs where, on the previous night, I thought I had seen living beings.",m
8206,No marks of them were evident.,m
8207,"The hard, yellow sand was smooth and trackless.",m
8208,"There was a stretch of a hundred yards between the foot of the cliffs and the foam-crested waves, and, calling to my mind my impressions of the previous night, I determined to put them to test.",m
8209,"Without avail, however.",m
8210,The great heap of debris caused by the working of the mine which Simpson had mentioned had now become covered with verdure.,m
8211,"I saw the green stains on the cliff which Simpson had said betokened copper, but nowhere could I see the level which he had mentioned.",m
8212,"I peered curiously around, but in vain.",m
8213,Presently I saw a fissure in the rocks which ended in a cave.,m
8214,"This I entered and made my way for a few yards, peering curiously around me.",m
8215,Nothing of importance struck my eye.,m
8216,"I reflected that this might be almost immediately under my house, and it was here, according to my fancies, I had heard voices on the previous night.",m
8217,"I fancied, too, that, except in the case of very high tides, this cave would always be dry.",m
8218,"I lit a match, and, looking at the sand at my feet, discerned footmarks.",m
8219,"This struck me as somewhat curious, especially as these footprints were apparently fresh, and some of them gave evidence that they had been made by a woman.",m
8220,"Still, there was nothing to wonder about.",m
8221,"I had frequently heard that the Cornish cliffs were honey-combed by caves, and that pleasure-parties visited them out of pure curiosity.",m
8222,"Then something bright caught my eye, and, stooping down, I picked up a woman's brooch.",m
8223,"I went outside and examined it, and saw immediately that it was apparently of value.",m
8224,"It was quaintly formed, and suggested great age.",m
8225,"I concluded that it was composed of dull gold fashioned centuries ago, while two stones of considerable value had been set in it.",m
8226,"I speculated a little to whom it might belong, and, thinking that I might hear of some one who had lost such a valuable trinket, I placed it carefully in my pocket so that I might be able to return it to its owner.",m
8227,"The sun by this time had increased in power, and, as the place was warm and sheltered, I sat on a great rock near, and gave myself up to fancy.",m
8228,"How long I sat there I have no conception, but presently I was awakened to the fact that Simpson had become anxious about me.",m
8229,"""It's all right, Simpson,"" I shouted in reply to his call.",m
8230,"""I will come immediately.""",m
8231,"""Breakfast is quite ready, sir,"" I heard him say, ""and I have been wondering where you had gone.""",m
8232,"As I made my way towards the lower part of the cliffs, where I thought I saw an easier way to my house than that by which I had descended, I happened to look back, and there, seated in a crevice at nearly the highest point of the cliff, I saw what seemed the form of a woman, and that she appeared to be watching me.",m
8233,A few seconds later I was hidden from her view by the copse into which I had entered.,m
8234,"When I had descended half-way towards my house I was able to catch another glimpse of the place where she had been sitting, but she was no longer there.",m
8235,"""I hope you haven't been anxious about me, Simpson?""",m
8236,"I said, when I returned to the house.",m
8237,"""Well, sir, I was a bit worried.",m
8238,"You see, the cliffs are dangerous, and you didn't tell me you were going out.",m
8239,"I am glad you are all right, sir.",m
8240,"Breakfast is quite ready, sir.",m
8241,"I cooked some more of that ham, as you seemed to like it so much last night, sir.""",m
8242,"""That's all right, Simpson; but before I have breakfast I must have another wash at the fountain.""",m
8243,"When I had taken off my coat I looked at my arms, and was shocked at their thinness.",m
8244,"I looked into the little pond and saw the reflection of a tall, thin, attenuated man.",m
8245,I was positively ghastly.,m
8246,"When I had finished my toilet I again glanced in the direction where I had seen the woman's form, but the place was hidden from my view.",m
8247,"Nearer to me, however, and swayed by the breeze, I saw what I thought was like a woman's dress fluttering.",m
8248,It might be that she was interested in my movements.,m
8249,"""I expect the people of the village have fears about me, as they had about Father Abraham,"" was my thought as I entered the house.",m
8250,"No visitors called to see me, and I spent several days in absolute quietness.",m
8251,"Although I had at first made up my mind to do so, I paid no visits to the village, and beyond the furtive watcher I have mentioned, I saw no one but Simpson.",m
8252,"My first feelings of exhilaration had passed away, and I settled down, in spite of my resolve, to a kind of hermit's life.",m
8253,"I still rejoiced in the beauty of the scene and took short walks in the neighborhood of my little dwelling-place, but saw no one.",m
8254,When I had been there a week a bad attack of my malady sent me to bed for three days.,m
8255,"Simpson urged me to send for the doctor, but this I would not do.",m
8256,"Rhomboid, who was at the head of his profession, had warned me that I should be subject to these attacks, and that they would come to me with increasing frequency until the end.",m
8257,He had also given me general instructions as to what I must do.,m
8258,"What was the use, then, of calling in a local practitioner who would be utterly ignorant as to what to do in such a case as mine?",m
8259,"At the end of three days I was better, and informed Simpson that I intended getting up.",m
8260,"""Simpson,"" I said, as I sat in the comfortable chair which he had prepared for me, ""you told me on the night we came here that you had been brought up a Wesleyan Methodist.""",m
8261,"""Yes, sir,"" was Simpson's reply.",m
8262,"""Are you of that persuasion still?""",m
8263,"""Well, yes, sir;",m
8264,"I suppose so, sir.""",m
8265,"""Have you been to any of their chapels lately?""",m
8266,"""Not very often, sir.""",m
8267,"""Is there a Wesleyan minister who lives at St.",m
8268,"Issey?""",m
8269,"""No, sir.",m
8270,"You see, St.",m
8271,Issey Chapel is only one of the little places in the circuit.,m
8272,"A minister, sir, lives five miles from here, and only comes about twice a quarter.",m
8273,"I have the circuit plan here, sir.",m
8274,"Would you like to see it?""",m
8275,"""It would be a curiosity, anyhow,"" I replied, and a little later Simpson put a sheet of printed paper in my hand.",m
8276,This sheet informed me that St.,m
8277,"Issey was in the Lanhydrock Circuit, and, with twelve other chapels, was supplied by two ministers and a number of other men called local preachers.",m
8278,"""I see that the superintendent minister is called Mr. Bendle.",m
8279,"Have you ever met him?""",m
8280,I asked.,m
8281,"""No, sir; but I have heard that he is a very good man.",m
8282,"When I was a boy, sir, St.",m
8283,"Issey Chapel was crowded; but people don't go to Chapel as they used to.""",m
8284,"""No?",m
8285,"How is that?""",m
8286,I asked.,m
8287,"""Well, sir, it seems as though people have become very worldly, and many have given up Chapel-going altogether.""",m
8288,"""And the Parish Church--do many people go there?""",m
8289,"""Just a few, sir; but not many, I am afraid.""",m
8290,"""I should like to know,"" I said.",m
8291,"""Indeed, sir?""",m
8292,"""Yes.",m
8293,"The truth is, Simpson, seeing that the doctor tells me I have to die very soon, I should like to know whether any one could tell me about what happens after death.""",m
8294,"""I have a Bible here, sir,"" said Simpson.",m
8295,"""It tells you all about it there.""",m
8296,"""Indeed,"" I said, ""I have not read the Bible for years.",m
8297,I don't think I have looked inside one since I left Oxford.,m
8298,"Do you read it, Simpson?""",m
8299,"""Yes, sir.",m
8300,"I read a chapter every night before going to bed.""",m
8301,"""Are you a Christian, Simpson?""",m
8302,"""I hope so, sir,"" and he looked at me curiously.",m
8303,"""Excuse me for asking,"" I said, ""but as you are a Christian you will have ideas about these things.""",m
8304,"Simpson hesitated a few seconds, and then called to his aid his old formula, ""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
8305,"""That being so, Simpson,"" I continued, ""I want your opinion.",m
8306,"Supposing I were to die to-night, what would become of me?""",m
8307,Simpson gave no answer.,m
8308,"I think he wanted to be polite, but could not be truthful at the same time.",m
8309,"""You see, Simpson,"" I interposed, ""I have just had a severe shaking up, and, as Rhomboid told me that these attacks would come with increasing frequency and hasten the end, I have a natural curiosity as to what will happen when the end comes.",m
8310,"It is not pleasant to think of becoming nothing, and as a belief in a future life is one of the tenets of the Christian faith, and as you tell me you are a Christian, I want to know, from your standpoint, what you think my destiny will be.""",m
8311,"""Excuse me, sir,"" said Simpson, ""but you will not be offended if I ask something?""",m
8312,"""Oh, no,"" I said, ""go on.""",m
8313,"""Well, then, sir, have you ever been converted?",m
8314,"Forgive me for asking, sir;",m
8315,"I know you have always been a well-conducted young gentleman, and you have never gone wild like lots I know of, but all the same, sir, I have been taught that there are two places to which people go when they die--heaven and hell.",m
8316,"The sheep which are on the right hand go straight to Abraham's bosom, and the goats which are on the left go into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.",m
8317,"The question is, sir, whether you belong to the sheep or the goats.""",m
8318,"""Exactly,"" I said;",m
8319,"""but what constitutes the sheep and what constitutes the goats?""",m
8320,"""That is where the question of conversion comes in,"" replied Simpson.",m
8321,"""Except we become converted we cannot go to heaven.""",m
8322,"""Then your opinion is, Simpson, that as I have not been converted I must go to hell?""",m
8323,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.",m
8324,"I don't mean to offend, sir.""",m
8325,"""No, I am sure you don't, Simpson.",m
8326,"Besides, I wanted a straight answer.",m
8327,"Just now, however, the question of heaven and hell does not trouble me at all.",m
8328,"It is rather a question as to whether there is anything at all after the grave.""",m
8329,"""Do you doubt it, sir?""",m
8330,"""I am afraid I have had no opinions about it in the past, Simpson.",m
8331,"You see, I have been so busy with my work that I have had no time to think about it.",m
8332,"Now, however, when death stares me in the face, I am--well, a little bit curious.",m
8333,"How do I know, and how do you know, that the millions of people who are dying every week in this world do not die just like flies?",m
8334,How can we prove that we are any better than they?,m
8335,"Do we not sport in the sunshine during a brief space and then cease to be?""",m
8336,"""Life would be a miserable one-sided business if it were so, sir.",m
8337,"Wouldn't it?""",m
8338,"""That is the question, Simpson.",m
8339,"Did you ever read Omar Khayyam?""",m
8340,"""What is it, sir?""",m
8341,"""Ah, I see you have not read him.",m
8342,"Omar Khayyam was an old Eastern poet who, in his philosophy and poetry, taught that we are just a part of an eternal round of things.",m
8343,"We are born, we live, we propagate our species, we die, and so the thing goes on.",m
8344,"But it is not a very cheerful doctrine, Simpson, and that was why I wondered if you, who profess to be a Christian, could give me some information.""",m
8345,Simpson was silent.,m
8346,"""Ah!",m
8347,"I see,"" I said with a sigh.",m
8348,"""You have a sort of traditional hope that there may be a sort of future life, and that you may get to what is called heaven, but you are not sure about it.""",m
8349,"""Well, sir, I am a very ignorant man on such matters,"" replied Simpson, ""and, to tell you the truth, religion doesn't seem to be the fashion nowadays.",m
8350,"All the same, it would be a grand thing if it were true.""",m
8351,"""Just so,"" I said, and for the first time I realized the necessity for some sort of faith which should be an anchor amid the storms of life.",m
8352,"""Are you better now, sir?"" asked Simpson.",m
8353,"""Oh yes, considerably better,"" I replied.",m
8354,"""I shall be able to walk about for the next few weeks, I hope.""",m
8355,"""Then, sir, may I advise you to go to Church or Chapel?",m
8356,"The preachers there might be able to tell you.""",m
8357,"""A good idea,"" I cried.",m
8358,"""I have not been to Church or Chapel since I left Oxford, and while there I only went because I was obliged to.",m
8359,"I did enjoy the singing, though.",m
8360,"Yes, Simpson, I will take your hint.",m
8361,"I will go to Church on Sunday.""",m
8362,"""It's Sunday to-morrow, sir,"" was Simpson's reply.",m
8363,"""Is it?",m
8364,I had forgotten.,m
8365,"Then I will go to-morrow.""",m
8366,"""Where will you go, sir, to the Established Church or the Wesleyan Chapel?""",m
8367,"""I will go to both, and hear what they have to say at both places.""",m
8368,The next day was gloriously fine.,m
8369,"A cool breeze blew, and out at sea ""white horses"" rode on the crests of the waves.",m
8370,"Near the coast-line, too, was a long streak of foam.",m
8371,The air was pure and invigorating.,m
8372,In sheltered places it was warm and gracious.,m
8373,I allowed myself plenty of time to reach St.,m
8374,"Issey by eleven o'clock, and, if the truth must be told, I was a little excited.",m
8375,I felt as though I was going on a tour of exploration.,m
8376,"I had never been what is called a religious boy, and though I inherited from my father a high code of honor, religion made no appeal to me.",m
8377,"I suppose that at the back of my mind I had an impression that there might be a life other than this, and that some great Eternal Force, which might or might not be personal, had created this and all other worlds.",m
8378,As to whether this Eternal Force had any interest in created life I did not trouble.,m
8379,"The question was too remote, and, as far as I could see, admitted of only a conjectural answer.",m
8380,"After leaving Oxford, I was too absorbed in my plans and ambitions to trouble about what seemed to me to be something really apart from life.",m
8381,I had never been a bad fellow.,m
8382,"I had, as my acquaintances said of me, gone straight.",m
8383,Not that I had been a recluse in any way.,m
8384,For two or three years I went a good deal into society.,m
8385,"I never had any serious love affairs, although I am afraid I indulged in some mild flirtations.",m
8386,"I had a fair knowledge of current literature, and, although far from being a scholar, I had at the same time scholarly instincts.",m
8387,"I had travelled on the Continent of Europe, had a fair knowledge of German and French, and during a long visit to Italy had managed to pick up the language of the people.",m
8388,"I had also visited the old churches on the Continent, but had never troubled about what these churches stood for.",m
8389,"As far as I could see, the old, stately cathedrals represented something that might have been a power at one time, but which had now passed away.",m
8390,"They were interesting from an architectural and from an historical point of view; but as for anything deeper, it never came within the horizon of my vision.",m
8391,"I was young, and, as I thought, healthy, and death seemed a long way off.",m
8392,"Therefore, why should I trouble?",m
8393,But now death had come near.,m
8394,"I do not know that I was frightened, and I was able calmly to face the prospect of annihilation.",m
8395,"Nevertheless, that prospect was grim.",m
8396,"I longed for life, more life, the completion of life.",m
8397,"The life I had lived was, it seemed to me, fragmentary, incomplete, and, to a certain extent, chaotic.",m
8398,I do not know that I attached very much importance to my visit to the little Wesleyan Chapel.,m
8399,"All the same, I was curious.",m
8400,"If there should be anything beyond, if the man who got up to preach could tell me something which had been hidden from me, I would like to hear what he had to say.",m
8401,I walked very slowly and rejoiced in the glorious morning.,m
8402,As I drew near the village I noted the quiet restfulness of everything.,m
8403,"The Church bells were ringing, and a few people were wending their way towards the old time-honored building.",m
8404,Very few people seemed to be making for the Wesleyan Chapel.,m
8405,"Groups of youths were lounging around the lanes, smoking cigarettes and passing rustic jokes.",m
8406,Women were gossiping with each other from their cottage doors.,m
8407,"There was no squalor anywhere, no poverty visible.",m
8408,Every one seemed to have enough to eat and drink.,m
8409,Every one seemed to be comfortably housed.,m
8410,"I entered the little Chapel--a square, plain building, capable of seating perhaps three or four hundred people.",m
8411,"It was five minutes to eleven when I entered, and not a soul was there, except a man whom I took to be the Chapel-keeper.",m
8412,He looked at me curiously.,m
8413,"By eleven o'clock there might be, all told, thirty people there, mostly elderly men and women.",m
8414,"Some young girls were there, and a few children; young men were conspicuous by their absence.",m
8415,"When eleven o'clock came perhaps a dozen more came from some vestry, and entered what I took to be the choir-seats.",m
8416,They were nearly all young women.,m
8417,Perhaps during the first ten minutes of the service half a score more came into the Chapel.,m
8418,"I am giving these details because I want to tell exactly what I saw, especially as I have discovered that from a religious standpoint St.",m
8419,Issey village is typical of hundreds more all over the county.,m
8420,At about three minutes after eleven a man entered the pulpit.,m
8421,"As far as I could judge he was a working man, or he might be a farmer, a carpenter, or a tradesman of some sort.",m
8422,Let it be understood that I came to this place of worship hungering to know something of the deeper things of life.,m
8423,"I wanted to be assured that there was another life greater than this, a life which should be the consummation and explanation of this.",m
8424,"The preacher commenced by announcing a hymn; a lad at the harmonium played over the tune, and the people sang.",m
8425,Let me confess here that the singing moved me.,m
8426,"The Cornish people, whatever their defects or virtues, possess the gift of song.",m
8427,"They had sweet, musical voices, and they sang heartily.",m
8428,"The words, as I remember them, were of an emotional nature, and were evidently written by some one who deeply believed in what he wrote; but it was evident that very few of the congregation realized the meaning of the words they were singing.",m
8429,"There was no sense of reality, no great assurance, no vision.",m
8430,"It seemed to be a repetition of something which had been, rather than the expression of something that was vital to them then.",m
8431,"Still, I was interested.",m
8432,The hymn made me think of far-away things.,m
8433,"At any rate, while no mighty conviction possessed the singers, they accepted the words as containing a kind of traditional truth.",m
8434,"I reflected that the hymn _had_ meant something, whatever it might mean now.",m
8435,"While the last verse was being sung, I noticed that the congregation turned round, as if some one of importance had entered.",m
8436,"I also turned, and saw a man and woman just making their way into a back pew.",m
8437,"The man was about fifty years of age, and was evidently a personality.",m
8438,At first I did not know how to classify him.,m
8439,"He might be the Squire of the parish, but I was sure he was not.",m
8440,"There was something lacking in him; something positive, too, which did not suggest an old landed proprietor.",m
8441,That he was prosperous and important there could be no doubt.,m
8442,"He looked like one accustomed to command, and suggested a big banking account.",m
8443,"His companion was, as I imagined, his daughter, a young woman of, say, twenty-three or twenty-four years of age.",m
8444,I saw by her dress that she did not belong to the class of which the rest of the congregation was composed.,m
8445,"Although by no means a connoisseur of such things, I knew enough of woman's attire to be sure that her clothes had been made by an artist, and probably came either from London or Paris.",m
8446,"During the next few minutes I gave furtive glances towards her, and was not impressed favorably.",m
8447,"She was good-looking, almost strikingly so; but she seemed to me to have no soul.",m
8448,She looked around the building as though she had come there under protest.,m
8449,She gave not the slightest evidence that the service meant anything to her.,m
8450,"The man in the pulpit was, I suppose, of more intelligence than the ordinary man of his class, and having said that, I have said all.",m
8451,I did not want to be critical.,m
8452,"I hungered for food, for light.",m
8453,I reflected that Simpson had told me that congregations had fallen off and that there seemed to be no eagerness about religion as there had been thirty years before.,m
8454,I did not wonder at that if this man was a fair exponent of it.,m
8455,"By what right or by what authority he was there I do not know, and how he dared to pretend to tell people about the deep things of life I could not imagine.",m
8456,"After he had been preaching a few minutes he appeared to get, according to the phraseology which I have since heard, ""warmed to his subject.""",m
8457,"This meant that he shouted, and on two or three occasions struck the Bible; but, taken as a whole, it was the parrot-like utterance of an ignorant man.",m
8458,"I am almost tempted to give a detailed description of his discourse, but I will not do so.",m
8459,I am too heart-sore at the thought of it.,m
8460,"What help was there for me, a poor wretch with his death-warrant signed?",m
8461,What help was there for the people who sat stolidly in their pews?,m
8462,Why should the boys and girls of the villages or the toil-worn laboring men and women go there?,m
8463,I could see no reason.,m
8464,"As far as I could judge, the presence of the man and his daughter in the back pew and I myself, the stranger who had taken up his abode in a wooden hut, attended only by a man-servant, was of far more interest to the people than what the man had to say.",m
8465,I left with a heavy heart.,m
8466,"At any rate, I received no assurance of any life after death.",m
8467,I was no nearer conviction of anything which goes by the name of spiritual.,m
8468,As I made my way to the door an old man came up and spoke to me.,m
8469,"""Mornin', sir.",m
8470,"Glad to see you.""",m
8471,"""Thank you,"" I said.",m
8472,"""You bean't from these parts, be you?"" he asked curiously.",m
8473,"""No,"" I replied.",m
8474,"""I hope you enjoyed the service,"" he ventured.",m
8475,"""I enjoyed the singing very much,"" was my reply.",m
8476,The old man's eyes twinkled.,m
8477,I saw that he understood.,m
8478,"""You ded'n feel the presence of the Maaster, ded 'ee, then, sir?""",m
8479,I was silent.,m
8480,"He seemed to be on the point of saying something more, but he refrained.",m
8481,Perhaps he thought he would be taking too great a liberty.,m
8482,"As I left the building and walked quietly away, I noticed that the man and the girl whom I took to be his daughter were watching me.",m
8483,They evidently wondered who I was.,m
8484,"I did not say anything to Simpson on my return about my experiences at the Chapel, and he asked no questions.",m
8485,When evening came I made my way to the Established Church.,m
8486,"Somehow, the memory of the old man's eyes when he spoke to me at the Chapel door remained with me.",m
8487,I had a feeling that he knew more than the preacher.,m
8488,"Directly I entered the time-honored building, which had stood there since pre-Reformation days, a feeling of restfulness came into my heart.",m
8489,"Architecture has always made a strong appeal to me, and this low-roofed, many-pillared edifice, with its worm-eaten pews, its granite flooring and its sense of age, brought a kind of balm to my troubled spirit.",m
8490,"I noticed that time had eaten away even the old gray granite of which the pillars were composed, that the footsteps of many generations had worn the hard Cornish granite slabs which floored the aisles.",m
8491,The evening light was subdued as it shone through the stained-glass windows.,m
8492,"The ivy which grew outside, and partially covered some of the leaded lights, somehow gave a feeling of restfulness to everything.",m
8493,"I heard the birds twittering in the tree-branches in the churchyard, while the bell which called the people to Church was reminiscent of olden time.",m
8494,"In my imagination I saw people who lived hundreds of years before, with the light of unquestioning faith in their eyes, coming to worship in the Church of their fathers.",m
8495,"A few people entered, and my vision vanished.",m
8496,"This old Church represented only something that _had_ been; something that had had its day, and was gone; something that was maintained because of its past, and because nothing better had appeared to take its place.",m
8497,A dozen choir-boys found their way into their stalls.,m
8498,The clergyman assumed his appointed place.,m
8499,The congregation was very small.,m
8500,"All counted, I suppose there would not be forty people present, and most of these looked to me like servant lads and girls.",m
8501,I remembered the clergyman's name.,m
8502,Simpson had told me he was called Trelaske.,m
8503,"A good old Cornish name, and I reflected that, anyhow, he would be a gentleman.",m
8504,"I watched him closely, and I saw a fine, aristocratic-looking man, with a clean-cut, almost classical face.",m
8505,He conducted the service with dignity.,m
8506,He read the sentences of which the Church service is composed correctly and with intelligence.,m
8507,"While he read in his natural voice, I was interested; when he intoned, a sense of unreality possessed me.",m
8508,As we went through the service a thousand memories flooded my mind.,m
8509,"I had heard these prayers, and read the Psalms a hundred times at Oxford and at Winchester.",m
8510,"Memories of old days came flashing back to me, and I was a boy again in the school chapel, listening to old ""Thunder and Lightning,"" as we used to call him, preaching to us.",m
8511,"Presently Mr. Trelaske entered the pulpit and gave out his text: ""If a man die, shall he live again?""",m
8512,"""Now,"" I thought to myself, ""I am going to get something.",m
8513,"Here is a man who is set apart to teach people the Christian faith, and he is going to deal with that phase of his faith in which I am really interested.""",m
8514,"I think he noticed me in his congregation, for he looked curiously towards me more than once.",m
8515,"I rather liked him, too.",m
8516,"As I said, he was evidently a gentleman, and doubtless had been to Oxford or Cambridge.",m
8517,Possibly he had been at my own College.,m
8518,In about ten minutes his homily was finished.,m
8519,"When I try to remember what he said, I am reminded of a story I have since heard.",m
8520,A popular preacher came to Cornwall and preached to a crowded congregation.,m
8521,"On the following day this popular preacher saw an old miner, to whom he spoke in a familiar fashion.",m
8522,"""Well, Tommy,"" he said, ""what did you think about my sermon last night?""",m
8523,"""What ded I think about it?"" repeated Tommy.",m
8524,"""Yes,"" said the popular preacher, ""what did you think about it?""",m
8525,"""I ded'n think there was nothin' to think about,"" was Tommy's reply.",m
8526,That was my summing-up of Mr. Trelaske's sermon.,m
8527,There was nothing to think about.,m
8528,"I had come to Church curious to know--ay, and more than curious;",m
8529,"I was longing to know if life promised anything beyond the grave, but the Church gave no answer to my question.",m
8530,"In place of burning conviction, there were empty platitudes.",m
8531,"In place of vision, there was only the sound of a child crying in the night.",m
8532,"""In God's name,"" I asked myself as I went back to my little habitation, ""why should people go to Church or to Chapel?",m
8533,"What is there for them but boredom?""",m
8534,"I did not want argument, I did not want learning; but I wanted conviction, light, vision--and there were none of these things.",m
8535,When I got back to my house I found that Simpson had returned.,m
8536,"""Have you been to Chapel, Simpson?""",m
8537,I asked.,m
8538,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.",m
8539,"People have been asking a lot of questions about you, sir.""",m
8540,"""Oh, indeed!""",m
8541,"""Yes, sir.",m
8542,"Mr. Josiah Lethbridge asked me about you, sir.",m
8543,He lives in that big house up by Trecarrel Lane.,m
8544,"He is a great mine-owner and ship-owner, sir.""",m
8545,"""Indeed,"" I said.",m
8546,"""Has he any children?""",m
8547,"""Yes, sir.",m
8548,One son and one daughter.,m
8549,"Is that all you need, sir?""",m
8550,And Simpson gave the finishing touches to his arrangement of my supper-table.,m
8551,Before I went to bed that night I stood under the veranda of my little house and looked seaward.,m
8552,In the dying light of the day I could still see the giant cliffs stretching away northward.,m
8553,I could also see the long line of foam where the waves broke upon the shore.,m
8554,"I heard the sea-birds crying, too.",m
8555,"""If a man die, shall he live again?""",m
8556,"I said, repeating the words of the text I had heard that night, but no answer came.",m
8557,I went to bed wondering.,m
8558,"IV  THREE VISITORS   On the day following nothing happened, and excepting Simpson I did not see a single person.",m
8559,"Indeed, but for one occasion, when out of curiosity I clambered down to the beach, I did not leave the house; but on the Tuesday I had a regular influx of visitors.",m
8560,"No less than three persons came to see me, to say nothing of Mrs. Martha Bray, who, in fulfilment of her promise to Simpson, came over to see whether her services were further needed.",m
8561,My first visitor was an entire stranger.,m
8562,"He came ostensibly to ask for a drink of milk, but really I believe out of curiosity, for when Simpson had, at my request, supplied him with the milk, he showed no desire to leave.",m
8563,Rather he appeared much interested in my reasons for coming to St.,m
8564,Issey.,m
8565,"He was a middle-aged man, say from forty-five to fifty, and lived, he told me, at St.",m
8566,Eia.,m
8567,"He proved a rather clever conversationalist, too, for in spite of myself I found myself talking to him freely.",m
8568,"There were all sorts of rumors about Father Abraham, he told me.",m
8569,"Some had it that he was mad; some said that he was a refugee; others, again, thought he had in the past committed some crime and was hiding from justice, while more than once it had been whispered that his end was the result of a kind of vendetta which was sworn against him because of something he did in his young manhood.",m
8570,"""Have you any theories yourself, sir?"" he asked.",m
8571,"""No,"" I replied, ""I have no theories.",m
8572,"I must confess, however, to being a little interested.",m
8573,"The old man evidently had a purpose in building the house, and, I think, intended it to be a permanent residence.",m
8574,"As you see, although it is composed of wood, it is very carefully built, and was intended to last.",m
8575,"For the life of me, however, I can hardly believe he was murdered.",m
8576,"Of course, there was blood found upon the floor, but it is not easy to dispose of a body even so near the sea.",m
8577,"From what I can hear no one has been washed up here, and but for the marks of struggle and the blood no one would have thought he was murdered.""",m
8578,"""Exactly,"" replied my visitor.",m
8579,"""But many things are going on of which we know nothing, and many people have purposes in life which they have no desire to make known.",m
8580,"What is your opinion of European politics?""",m
8581,"""I cannot say I have any very fixed ideas,"" I replied.",m
8582,"""A section of the Press,"" went on my visitor, ""would have us believe that we are on the verge of war, and certainly there have been indications these last few years that we are standing on the brink of a volcano.",m
8583,"Do you believe in the stories told about Germany?""",m
8584,"""What stories?""",m
8585,I asked.,m
8586,"""Oh, that the Germans are preparing for war, and that they mean to go to war with England.""",m
8587,To this I gave no answer.,m
8588,"""Have you read those articles in _The Daily_----?"" he asked.",m
8589,"""I mean those articles which told us frightful stories of German preparations for war, of their avowed determination to bring about war with England, and of the toast which the military and naval people in Germany drink on every great occasion.""",m
8590,"""You mean the toast to 'Der Tag'?",m
8591,"Of course, one has heard such stories, but what do they amount to, after all?""",m
8592,"""That is my own attitude,"" was his answer, ""and as far as stories about German spies are concerned, I think they are worked up by the Press in order to increase the circulation of the papers.",m
8593,"By the way, have you ever seen anything suspicious in this neighborhood?",m
8594,"This,"" and he looked towards the bay, ""would be a splendid spot for German boats to land if they wanted to do so.""",m
8595,"""Why should they want to land in a remote corner of the world like this?""",m
8596,I asked.,m
8597,"""Exactly,"" he replied, ""only I was wondering whether you, who live here alone, had ever seen or heard anything which aroused your suspicions?""",m
8598,"""No,"" I replied, not thinking it worth while to tell him anything about the brooch I had found.",m
8599,"""You have seen nothing and heard nothing, then?"" he persisted.",m
8600,"""I have only been here a short time,"" I replied.",m
8601,"""Why do you ask?""",m
8602,"""I only wondered, that is all.",m
8603,The people over at St.,m
8604,"Eia say that foreigners have been sneaking around trying to pick up information, and I wondered whether you had heard anything.""",m
8605,"""No,"" I replied, ""nothing at all.""",m
8606,"""I suppose,"" he said, ""that these cliffs here are honey-combed with caves?",m
8607,"Have you seen any of them?""",m
8608,"""Yes,"" I replied.",m
8609,"""I saw one the day after I came here.",m
8610,"I came upon it suddenly, for the entrance to it is only a fissure in the rocks.""",m
8611,"""Ah!"" he cried.",m
8612,"""Did you enter?""",m
8613,"""Yes,"" was my reply, ""but it was not at all mysterious.",m
8614,"I could see all round it by the aid of a match, and it contained nothing.",m
8615,"Of course, it was very curious and very interesting.""",m
8616,"""But you saw nothing suspicious?"" he asked.",m
8617,I shook my head.,m
8618,"My visitor did not remain long after this, and although for a time I wondered why he should be so interested, I soon ceased to pay attention to his questions.",m
8619,"Perhaps I should have thought more about him, but just before noon I had another visitor.",m
8620,"This was a young fellow about twenty-two years of age, whom I knew to be an Oxford man before he had spoken a dozen words.",m
8621,"""My name is Lethbridge,"" he said.",m
8622,"""My people live up at Trecarrel yonder, and I came--well, I came really at my pater's request.""",m
8623,"""Indeed,"" I said, looking at him curiously.",m
8624,"""Yes; you were at Chapel on Sunday morning, weren't you?""",m
8625,"""I was,"" I replied.",m
8626,"""Well, my pater and sister were there, and the pater wondered very much who you were.",m
8627,"In the evening, contrary to his usual custom, he went a second time, and saw your servant, who told him who you were.",m
8628,"Directly the pater mentioned your name, I remembered hearing it in Oxford.",m
8629,"You are an Oxford man, aren't you?""",m
8630,"""Yes.",m
8631,"I was at Balliol.""",m
8632,"""So was I. I left last June.",m
8633,You are often spoken of by the men.,m
8634,"Indeed, I had your old rooms.",m
8635,"You will excuse the liberty we took in talking about you, won't you? but really we have very little to interest us in this corner of the world.""",m
8636,"""You are very kind to come,"" I replied.",m
8637,"""When I told my father who you were, he suggested that I should come down and ask you to come up to dinner.",m
8638,"You see, we had heard of some one coming to live in old Father Abraham's hut, and when it turned out to be you, we got interested.",m
8639,"You will forgive this informal method of procedure, won't you?",m
8640,"But if you will come up and spend an evening with us soon, we shall all be jolly glad.""",m
8641,"""I am afraid I am too ill to come,"" I replied.",m
8642,"""You do look a bit seedy,"" was his response, ""but the air down here is ripping.",m
8643,"It will soon set you up again.""",m
8644,"""I am afraid I am too far gone for that,"" was my reply, ""but if I am well enough, I shall be only too glad to come.""",m
8645,"""Say to-morrow night,"" he said.",m
8646,"""If you will leave it an open question,"" was my reply, ""I will say yes, but if I am too ill, you will understand the reason for my absence.""",m
8647,He looked at me closely.,m
8648,"""Is it as bad as that?""",m
8649,"""I am afraid it is,"" and I sighed when I spoke, for at that moment a wave of desire for life rolled over me.",m
8650,"""May I smoke?"" he asked, pulling out his pipe.",m
8651,"""Please forgive me,"" I said.",m
8652,"""I will tell Simpson to bring some cigars.""",m
8653,"""Oh no, thank you.",m
8654,"A pipe for me, please.",m
8655,"By the way, I did not know you were of the Chapel-going order.",m
8656,"The one reason I doubted it was you was because my father said you were at the little Wesleyan Chapel.""",m
8657,"""I went there out of curiosity, I am afraid.",m
8658,"I was wondering whether these people had anything to say to a man whose days were numbered.""",m
8659,"""I go there twice a year,"" was his reply.",m
8660,"""I used to go regularly when a boy.",m
8661,"Do you intend to stay long down here, by the way?""",m
8662,"""To the end, I expect,"" I said, shrugging my shoulders.",m
8663,"""Come, now, we will not talk like that.",m
8664,I am sorry to see you looking so seedy.,m
8665,You were always spoken of in Oxford as an athlete.,m
8666,"You got your Blue, didn't you?""",m
8667,"""Yes,"" I replied;",m
8668,"""but one never knows what germs of disease one has in one's system.",m
8669,"However, we will not talk about that.",m
8670,"It is awfully good of you to ask me to come up to your house.""",m
8671,"""Rather it will be awfully good of you if you come,"" he replied.",m
8672,"""What a jolly fine view you have here.",m
8673,The old man who built this hut chose one of the most beautiful positions on the whole coast.,m
8674,"How did you find it out?""",m
8675,"""Simpson, my man, did that for me,"" was my reply.",m
8676,"""He was a boy down here, he says, and when I told him I had to get away from London, he came down here on spec.",m
8677,"I consider myself very lucky.""",m
8678,"""I am afraid you will find it a bit lonely in the winter, won't you?",m
8679,"The sea is all right when the sun is shining on it, but in winter, when the clouds are black, I know of nothing more dismal.",m
8680,"Besides, those black, beetling cliffs are enough to strike terror into one's soul.""",m
8681,I must confess to liking young Lethbridge.,m
8682,"He was an athletic, healthy-looking young fellow, tanned by much exposure to the sun, and his every look and movement suggested frankness and honesty.",m
8683,"I did not judge him to be very clever, but he was certainly likeable.",m
8684,"""You were doing very well at the Bar, weren't you?"" he went on.",m
8685,"""Our chaps at Balliol spoke of you as one who would bring added lustre to the old College.""",m
8686,"""I was only just beginning to see light,"" was the reply.",m
8687,"""I was lucky in one of the cases I had, and won it by a fluke.",m
8688,That was why briefs were beginning to come in.,m
8689,But I have got to the end of them now.,m
8690,"What do you do with yourself?""",m
8691,"""That is the hang of it,"" he replied.",m
8692,"""I am doing nothing.",m
8693,"The pater wanted me to go in for the Law, and then try for Parliament.",m
8694,"He has an idea that I ought to represent one of the Cornish constituencies, but I am not cut out for that sort of thing.""",m
8695,"""What would you like to be?""",m
8696,I asked.,m
8697,"""Oh, a farmer,"" he replied.",m
8698,"""If, instead of spending all the money he has spent in sending me to Oxford, the pater had bought a thousand acres of land and set me up farming, I should be as happy as a king, but law books are just Sanskrit to me.",m
8699,"I love an open-air life, and I love horses and animals generally.",m
8700,"The pater won't see things in my light, however; that is why I am doing nothing.",m
8701,I wish you would tell him when you come up that none but brainy men can do anything at the Bar.,m
8702,"Well, it is close upon lunch-time, and I must go.",m
8703,"But you will be sure to come, won't you?",m
8704,"Look here, let's have an understanding.",m
8705,"I will send the motor down to the end of the lane to-morrow evening at seven o'clock, and then, if you cannot come, you can send your man out to tell the chauffeur.",m
8706,"But be sure to come, if you can.""",m
8707,When he had gone I somehow felt better.,m
8708,"His very presence was healthful, and I looked forward with pleasure to meeting him again.",m
8709,"""You have been quite busy this morning, sir,"" said Simpson when he came in to lay the table for my lunch.",m
8710,"""Two visitors in one day in a neighborhood like this is something wonderful.""",m
8711,"""Yes,"" I replied, ""and I like young Lethbridge.""",m
8712,"""I hear he is a great trouble to his father, sir.""",m
8713,I did not reply to this.,m
8714,"""You see, sir, old Mr. Lethbridge wants him to marry into a county family.",m
8715,"The truth is, when I was a boy down here he was only a poor lad.",m
8716,How he has got on in the way he has is a mystery to every one.,m
8717,"Somehow or other everything he touched turned to money, and now he is richer than Mr. Treherne, the Squire.",m
8718,"He is very ambitious, too, and wants to get in with the county people.",m
8719,"That is why people wonder at his sticking to the Wesleyan Chapel.""",m
8720,"""But how has young Lethbridge caused him trouble?""",m
8721,I asked.,m
8722,"""Well, sir, it is said that he's in love with a farmer's daughter, and that the old gentleman says he will cut him off with a shilling if he doesn't make up to Miss Treherne.",m
8723,"Of course, people will talk, and maybe it is only gossip.""",m
8724,"I felt more interested than ever in young Lethbridge after this, although I was rather annoyed with myself that I had listened to servants' gossip.",m
8725,"All the same, I believed there might be some truth in what I had heard.",m
8726,There was a look in the young fellow's eyes which suggested that the deepest longings in his heart were unsatisfied.,m
8727,"Before the day was over, the old adage which says that it never rains but it pours was fulfilled in my case.",m
8728,Simpson had only just brought my tea when he came to me with an important look on his face.,m
8729,"""Mr. Trelaske, the Vicar, has called to see you, sir.""",m
8730,"""Good!""",m
8731,I replied.,m
8732,"""Show him in.""",m
8733,"""I hope you will forgive the liberty I am taking,"" said the Vicar on entering, ""but, as you are one of my parishioners, and I was told you were at Church on Sunday evening, I thought I might call.""",m
8734,"""It is very kind of you,"" I said.",m
8735,"""You have just come in time for tea, too.",m
8736,"Won't you sit down?""",m
8737,"Mr. Trelaske did not look so imposing, as he sat in my little room, as when wearing his clerical robes in Church.",m

8739,"""I suppose you know that you are the subject of a great deal of discussion in St.",m

8741,"""I'm very flattered,"" was my reply.",m

8748,"As for the coast scenery round here, it is, in my opinion, the most beautiful in the whole country.",m
8749,"Anyhow, a stranger attracts a great deal of notice.",m
8750,"Then, you see, this hut is a mystery.""",m
8751,"""Yes, I have heard all about that,"" I replied, ""but I dare say a great deal of the mystery has been magnified.",m
8752,"Anyhow, it suits me entirely; it is situated in one of the most lovely spots in the vicinity.",m
8753,"It is utterly quiet, and yet it is not altogether out of the world.""",m
8754,"""Might one ask, Mr. Erskine,"" he said, turning to me suddenly, ""why you came to this part of the world?""",m
8755,"""I came here to die,"" I replied.",m
8756,He stared at me curiously.,m
8757,"""To die, Mr. Erskine?"" he said.",m
8758,"""Yes,"" I replied.",m
8759,"""I have been given a year to live--at the outside.",m
8760,It may be that I shall only last a month or two.,m
8761,"When I told my man Simpson about it, and said I wanted to die in the most pleasant place possible, and to do it rather cheaply, he came down here and took this house.""",m
8762,"""Y-you do look rather seedy,"" he stammered.",m
8763,"""But surely it is not so bad as that?""",m
8764,"""Dr. Rhomboid, who is at the head of his profession, examined me very carefully, and that was the verdict he passed.",m
8765,"That was why I went to Church last Sunday night.""",m
8766,"""I don't think I quite understand you,"" and the Vicar looked at me as though he doubted my sanity.",m
8767,"""You are an Oxford man, aren't you?"" he went on.",m
8768,"""At least, that is what I have heard; and you were a barrister, and have won some repute in that direction?""",m
8769,"""With the exception of your last sentence, you have been correctly informed,"" was my reply.",m
8770,"""What I have told you is quite true, nevertheless.",m
8771,"It is also true that I went to Church last Sunday night because of what Dr. Rhomboid told me,"" and I looked at his face curiously, because I wanted to see how he would take it.",m
8772,"""No,"" I continued, ""I am not an illustration of the old rhyme:      ""The devil was sick, the devil a monk would be,     The devil was well, and the devil a monk was he!",m
8773,"It is not that at all; but do you know, Mr. Trelaske, when a man is suddenly told that he has only a year to live, and may possibly die in a few weeks, he is, to say the least of it, somewhat curious to know what will happen after he is dead.",m
8774,"I repeat, that is why I went to Church last Sunday night.""",m
8775,"""Yes, yes, certainly,"" and I thought he seemed a little bit uneasy.",m
8776,"""Mr. Trelaske,"" I said, ""what happens to a man after he is dead?""",m
8777,"He was silent for a few seconds, and again he looked at me as if he doubted my sanity.",m
8778,"""I am not joking,"" I persisted.",m
8779,"""After all, it is a matter of some interest to me, and as you are a clergyman, and as a belief in a future life is one of the articles of the faith you preach, I thought I would ask your opinion about it.""",m
8780,"""But surely, Mr. Erskine,"" he said, ""you are not a heathen.",m
8781,You are an old 'Varsity man.,m
8782,"You took an arts degree, and would, to say the least of it, have had to study the Greek Testament.",m
8783,"You know what is taught there.""",m
8784,"""Excuse me,"" was my reply, ""but that doesn't quite meet the situation.",m
8785,"It is quite true, as you say, that I had to study the New Testament at Oxford, and also while at school at Winchester I was in a Confirmation Class; but all that kind of thing is a long way off.",m
8786,"It is simply traditional, and when a man comes down to the depths of life traditions don't count.",m
8787,"It is true that I have not read the New Testament lately, not, indeed, since I left Oxford.",m
8788,"I am like thousands of other fellows, who, on going out into the world, give these things the go-by.",m
8789,"Years ago I suppose I held to the traditional faith, although I have troubled very little about it; but now, as things are, I am interested--I am more than interested.",m
8790,"What will happen to me a few months hence, when I am dead?",m
8791,"Anything?""",m
8792,"I could quite see that he was surprised at the course the conversation was taking, and that he had no expectation of being asked such questions; but now that I had spoken, I meant to know all that he could tell me.",m
8793,"""Our state in the future,"" was his reply, ""depends on the life we have lived here.""",m
8794,"""Isn't that rather begging the question?""",m

8796,"""You are assuming something which, as it seems to me, is a matter of doubt.",m
8797,"No, do not mistake me, I haven't lived a bad life.",m
8798,I have not descended to the vulgar vices which are supposed to be so common to men in these days.,m
8799,"I have, as my acquaintances say of me, 'gone straight.'",m
8800,I listened very attentively to your sermon on Sunday night.,m
8801,"You see, I was more than ordinarily interested.",m
8802,"Your text was, 'If a man die, shall he live again?'",m
8803,"Will he, Mr. Trelaske?""",m
8804,"""Of course,"" was his reply.",m
8805,"""Are you _sure_?""",m
8806,"I asked, emphasizing the word.",m
8807,"""Hasn't it been the teaching of the Church from its earliest history?"" and he looked a little indignant.",m
8808,"""Excuse me, but if you will forgive me for saying so, the teaching of the Church is the very thing in question.",m
8809,"As you may imagine, I do not ask the question out of idle curiosity;",m
8810,"I am deeply interested, vitally interested.",m
8811,"Mr. Trelaske, are you sure, if I were to die to-night, that there would be anything after?",m
8812,"Mind you, I do not ask for a mere opinion; we all have those, but is it a matter of certainty with you?""",m
8813,"""As I said on Sunday night,"" he replied, after some silence, ""spiritual things are spiritually discerned; and immortality is a matter of the spirit, isn't it?""",m
8814,"""I am afraid I don't follow you,"" I replied.",m
8815,"""As you said just now, I am a lawyer, and my business for several years has been to test evidence.",m
8816,"After I have tested the evidence that has been brought in support of any particular case, it has been my business to convince the jury that the evidence is conclusive.",m
8817,"If I don't convince the jury, of course I fail to win my case.",m
8818,Your answer suggests that I lack the qualities to understand the proofs in support of the doctrine you taught on Sunday night.,m
8819,Perhaps you are right; probably I have so neglected what you call the spiritual part of me that it has become atrophied.,m
8820,"I will put it in another way, then, and, believe me, it is furthest from my desire to be impertinent.",m
8821,"Supposing you were to die to-night--you, an ordained clergyman--are you _sure_ there is a life beyond?""",m
8822,Mr. Trelaske was silent.,m
8823,"""Forgive my asking you,"" I said.",m
8824,"""I am afraid I have been frightfully rude; but you see, living here alone, with the doctor's verdict constantly before me, I am curious to know.""",m
8825,"""Not at all, not at all,"" he said hastily, ""I am very glad you asked me; but the question is so sudden.",m
8826,I do not think that during the whole time I have lived in St.,m
8827,"Issey any one has asked me such a thing before, at least not in the same way.""",m
8828,"""I was wrong,"" I said;",m
8829,"""please forgive me.""",m
8830,I could see that I had made him miserable.,m
8831,The look in his eyes told me that.,m
8832,"As I said before, Mr. Trelaske was evidently a gentleman, and he wanted to be absolutely honest with me.",m
8833,"All the same, his silence made my heart heavy.",m
8834,"Although I had, in a way, made up my mind that there was nothing after death, the thought of becoming nothing was grim and repellent.",m
8835,"""Look here, Mr. Erskine,"" he said, after a somewhat painful silence, ""you must come to the Vicarage and see me.",m
8836,"I will think over what you have said, and then perhaps I shall be better prepared to meet the situation.""",m
8837,"From that time the conversation drifted to general matters, and when the Vicar left me, it was on the understanding that I should, at an early date, spend an evening with him.",m
8838,V  AN EMERGING MYSTERY   After the Vicar had gone I suffered a slight reaction.,m
8839,"My mind was almost abnormally active, but physically I felt utterly languid and depressed.",m
8840,"I could see that Simpson was watching me closely, and when I did not do justice to the dinner he had provided he was almost as depressed as I.  ""I could not help hearing what you and the Vicar were talking about, sir,"" he said presently.",m
8841,"""I tried not to listen, but some things came to me in spite of myself.""",m
8842,"""You heard nothing very edifying, Simpson.""",m
8843,"""No, sir; all the same, I was sorry for you.""",m
8844,"""Sorry for me!",m
8845,"Why?""",m
8846,"""Well, sir, I think I understand how you feel.",m
8847,"I am only a poor, ignorant man, sir, but I think I should feel something the same myself.",m
8848,"Mr. Trelaske did not help you much, did he?""",m
8849,"""Well, he did not seem any more sure than you did, Simpson.""",m
8850,"""Yes, sir;",m
8851,I cannot understand it.,m
8852,"I was at the death-bed of my father, sir; he was what you would call an old-fashioned Methodist.",m
8853,"He was not clever or learned, or anything of that sort; but he was very sure, sir.""",m
8854,"""Sure of what, Simpson?""",m
8855,"""Sure that he was going to heaven; sure that this life was only a school for a greater life, sir.",m
8856,"I am afraid I have not put it very well, but he was what the Vicar says he isn't--sure.",m
8857,"What I can't understand, sir, is that religion seems to have no meaning nowadays.",m
8858,I was hoping that when I got down here I should find things the same as they were when I left home forty years ago.,m
8859,"Then, sir, religion meant something; it doesn't now.",m
8860,"They say the same words at Chapel as they used to say, but they do not mean the same things.""",m
8861,"""You mean that religion is dead altogether, then, Simpson?""",m
8862,"""I don't mean that, sir.",m
8863,I only mean that people seem to have lost it.,m
8864,"It seems a terrible thing, doesn't it, sir, that when a young gentleman like you wants to know something, and you go to Chapel, and to Church, to learn the thing they ought to be able to tell you, you find out that they know no more than you do?",m
8865,"However, sir, it isn't for me to criticize.",m
8866,"Is there anything more I can do for you, sir?""",m
8867,"""No, nothing at present, Simpson;"" and I turned to the book-shelves that he had fitted up, hoping to find a book that would interest me.",m
8868,"In this, however, I utterly failed.",m
8869,"I turned from volume to volume, but could fasten my mind on nothing.",m
8870,Books which a few months ago would have enabled me to pass a pleasant evening seemed meaningless and absurd.,m
8871,"I turned from one writer to another, but always with the same result.",m
8872,What they had to say meant nothing.,m
8873,"Of course, my mind was in an abnormal condition, but that was not my fault.",m
8874,"Here was I, face to face with death, hungering for reality, hungering for truths that were vital.",m
8875,My law books repelled me.,m
8876,"What did I care about old Acts of Parliament, passed hundreds of years before?",m
8877,"Of what interest to me were the decisions of old judges, long since dead?",m
8878,"They affected only some nice points of law, which, as far as I could see, mattered nothing.",m
8879,They never touched the depths of life at all.,m
8880,"Then there were novels, many of them written by men and women I knew personally.",m
8881,But they had nothing to say to me.,m
8882,"I did not care a fig about paltry intrigues, neither was I in the slightest degree interested in _risque_ situations.",m
8883,"I went to the door, and looked out into the silent night.",m
8884,"Daylight had just gone, and that kind of atmosphere which can only be felt just after sunset and just before sunrise, pervaded everything.",m
8885,The air was full of mystery.,m
8886,"The wondrous depths of the sky, the wide sweep of the Atlantic, the cry of the sea-birds, and that deep hush which accompanies the dying day, aroused infinite longings.",m
8887,"What was life, its meaning, its mystery, its destiny?",m
8888,Simpson came to my side.,m
8889,"""I beg your pardon, sir, but you are not going out, are you?""",m
8890,"I had not thought of it, but his words caused me to determine to go for a walk.",m
8891,"""Yes, Simpson, I am,"" I replied.",m
8892,"""Shall I go with you, sir?""",m
8893,"""No, thank you, Simpson, I will go alone.""",m
8894,"""Excuse me, sir, but are you not foolish?",m
8895,"Walking in the night might do you harm, sir; it might shorten your days.""",m
8896,"""What does that matter?""",m
8897,I asked.,m
8898,"""As the end is so near, of what consequence are a few days, or, for that matter, weeks?",m
8899,"The sooner I die, the sooner I shall solve the great mystery of the Beyond, if there is a Beyond; if there isn't, what have I to live for here?""",m
8900,"""I beg your pardon, sir, I am very sorry.""",m
8901,And Simpson sighed.,m
8902,"I put on a light overcoat, and made my way to the highest point of the cliffs.",m
8903,"Beneath me, far down, perhaps three or four hundred feet, the waves rolled on the black, rugged rocks.",m
8904,"As I looked seaward, the water, as it seemed to me, became darker and darker.",m
8905,"The lines of foam, which stretched along by the coast, became more and more distinct.",m
8906,Night had now fallen.,m
8907,The sky was star-spangled.,m
8908,I had never seen such a sky in England before.,m
8909,"Once or twice down by the Mediterranean I had seen something similar, but never in my own country.",m
8910,"I felt as though invisible presences were near me, as though they were trying to speak to me; but I could not understand the language.",m
8911,"Unmindful of consequences, I sat down on the heather, and gave myself up to fancy.",m
8912,I tried to pierce the veil which hung between me and the Beyond.,m
8913,I tried to understand the meaning of the far-off voices which were wafted to me by the night breezes.,m
8914,I wanted to read the riddle of Life and Death.,m
8915,"Then, suddenly, I heard voices, and I was brought back from things intangible and mysterious to things mundane.",m
8916,"""You are sure he knows nothing?""",m
8917,It was a woman's voice I heard.,m
8918,"""Perfectly sure.",m
8919,I questioned him closely this morning.,m
8920,"I so framed my questions that he could have no suspicion--but always with the same result.""",m
8921,"""But why should he choose a place like this?",m
8922,"Surely, if he is ill, dying, he would never come to a madman's hut, in a place where murder was supposed to be committed.""",m
8923,"""I tell you that there is no need for fear; he suspects nothing--he is just what he seems to be.""",m
8924,The voices died away.,m
8925,"The man and woman whom I had heard talking, and whom I had dimly seen, descended the hill, and were lost in the darkness.",m
8926,"Then it was that, in spite of myself, I became interested in things mundane.",m
8927,"Why they should do so I could not imagine, but I felt that they had been talking about me.",m
8928,But why should they?,m
8929,What was the purport of their conversation?,m
8930,How had I become mixed up in the plans of people of whom I knew nothing?,m
8931,"I felt myself at the centre of a mystery, and my interest in that mystery caused the greater mystery of Life and Death to lose its hold on me.",m
8932,I recognized the voice of the man.,m
8933,He had been to see me soon after my arrival; but who was the woman?,m
8934,What interest could my movements have to her?,m
8935,"She spoke like one having authority, and it was evident that she feared I should discover something.",m
8936,"I forgot my ailments, forgot the tragedy of my life, in trying to solve this new riddle.",m
8937,I could not help connecting it with the old-fashioned brooch I had picked up in the cave accidentally the day I had come to Cornwall.,m
8938,The activities and interests in this life again became paramount.,m
8939,"""I will get to the bottom of this, anyway,"" I said to myself as I made my way back to my hut.",m
8940,"""It will be better for me, too, than to be forever brooding about myself.",m
8941,"And, after all, while I am alive I will live, and I will keep my eyes and ears open until I have discovered what this means.""",m
8942,"When I reached my little room again, Simpson awaited me eagerly.",m
8943,"""Please, sir,"" he said, ""I have had visitors.""",m
8944,"""More visitors, Simpson?""",m
8945,"""Yes, sir, a gentleman and a lady.""",m
8946,"""Do you know who they are?""",m
8947,"""No, sir; they are both complete strangers.",m
8948,"They came and asked to see you, and I told them you were not to be seen, sir.",m
8949,"They asked a good many questions about you, but I told them nothing.""",m
8950,"""And then, Simpson?""",m
8951,"""The gentleman gave me his card, with his compliments, sir.""",m
8952,"I took the card and read the address:      MR. JOHN LIDDICOAT,            THE HILL TOP,                  ST.",m
8953,EIA.,m
8954,"""All right, Simpson,"" I said.",m
8955,"""I shan't want you any more to-night.""",m
8956,"""Please, sir,"" said Simpson, ""I have some books here which I think might interest you.""",m
8957,"""Hang books!""",m
8958,I replied.,m
8959,"""I don't feel like reading.""",m
8960,"Then, feeling ashamed of myself for not appreciating Simpson's kindness, I added, ""It's awfully good of you, Simpson, and I might like them after all.",m
8961,"What is it you have got?""",m
8962,"""John Wesley's _Journal_, sir.",m
8963,"He came to this part of Cornwall, and I thought you might like to read about it.",m
8964,"Not that I should advise you to read to-night, sir, if I might take such a liberty, but perhaps to-morrow.",m
8965,"Good-night, sir.""",m
8966,And he left me.,m
8967,"I was just on the point of going to bed, when, on opening one of the volumes he had placed on the table, I came upon a passage which interested me.",m
8968,I saw that the name of St.,m
8969,"Issey was mentioned, and a description given of this very neighborhood.",m
8970,In a few minutes I had become utterly absorbed.,m
8971,Hitherto John Wesley had only been a name to me.,m
8972,I had had no interest either in his life or work.,m
8973,"I had looked upon him as somewhat of a fanatic, who had appealed to the fears of a superstitious people, and had founded a sect.",m
8974,"Now, however, he revealed himself to me in a new light.",m
8975,"This diary was the work of a thoughtful man, and a cultured man, too, who had lived his life to the full, and who faced its issues squarely.",m
8976,"My word, religion had meant something to him!",m
8977,"It was not a mere name, a tradition, a set of dogmas, a respectable institution.",m
8978,"It was something real, vital, pulsating with life.",m
8979,"To him the Founder of Christianity was not a mere mystic and social reformer, who lived nineteen hundred years ago on a little strip of land on the Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean, but a Divine Person, Who lived now.",m
8980,"This John Wesley, who was an educated man and a thoughtful man, spoke like one who knew, and because of it he had authority and power.",m
8981,"I went on reading page after page, until, looking at my watch, I found it was past midnight.",m
8982,"VI  THE LETHBRIDGE FAMILY   We had adjourned to the smoke-room, and for my own part, I was feeling better than I had felt for some time.",m
8983,"Opposite me sat Mr. Lethbridge, while by my side sat young Hugh Lethbridge, who had been to see me the day before.",m
8984,"I had eaten a good dinner, and felt inclined to take a bright view of everything.",m
8985,"Mr. Lethbridge had played the part of host perfectly, and had done his best to make me feel welcome, not only as a visitor in the neighborhood, but in his house.",m
8986,"I had the opportunity, moreover, of making the acquaintance of his wife and daughter.",m
8987,"The former was a well-meaning lady, whose _metier_ was to manage other people's affairs.",m
8988,"While we were at dinner she gave her husband a great deal of information as to how he should manage his men, how he should work the mines he owned, and how the vessels he controlled should be utilized.",m
8989,"She also informed her son how he should spend his time, what his amusements and avocations should be.",m
8990,She greatly amused us all by describing what she would do if she were a girl again.,m
8991,She had opinions about everything in heaven above and on earth beneath.,m
8992,"I found that she knew intimately the history of every family in the neighborhood, and she took it upon herself to manage the affairs of those families.",m
8993,"She might be rather a tiresome person to live with, but for my own part I found her vastly entertaining.",m
8994,"Young Hugh Lethbridge told her that he intended writing to the Prime Minister, offering her services as general adviser to the Government, while her daughter laughingly remarked that she would wear herself out in attending to the affairs of people who had a distinct preference for attending to their own business.",m
8995,"Mrs. Lethbridge took it all in a good humor, however, and seemed to regard it as her chief business to be a universal helper.",m
8996,"She even went so far as to instruct me how I might deal with Simpson, and gave me a great deal of valuable advice on housekeeping.",m
8997,I found that Isabella Lethbridge was entirely different from her mother.,m
8998,On the whole she puzzled me.,m
8999,That she was intelligent there could be no doubt whatever.,m
9000,"In many ways she was attractive, but on the whole I did not like her.",m
9001,"For one thing, I thought she showed bad taste in holding up her mother to ridicule, while more than once I thought she revealed an almost sullen disposition.",m
9002,"Still, she was interesting.",m
9003,"She was more than ordinarily good-looking, and at times became quite animated.",m
9004,"The family, as a whole, did not strike me as ideal.",m
9005,They seemed to be at cross-purposes with each other.,m
9006,"I could see that Mr. Lethbridge did not at all understand his son, and resented any difference of opinion which might exist between them.",m
9007,He apparently regarded Hugh as a boy who should unquestioningly obey his father's behests without regard to his own feelings and opinions; and yet he seemed to be angry with him for not being something in the world which would give him a position among his fellow-men.,m
9008,And yet I am sure Mr. Lethbridge meant well.,m
9009,"He was, as I have before suggested, a strong, capable man, and fully bore out what I had heard concerning him.",m
9010,"He could never have been a nonentity, wherever he was placed, and whatever he took in hand he would do with such conscientiousness and thoroughness as to make it succeed.",m
9011,"Consequently, it was no wonder that he had risen from a poor lad to be a man of wealth and of eminence in the county.",m
9012,"That he was exceedingly ambitious there could be no doubt, and I judged that he was a little bit sore that all his ambitions had not been realized.",m
9013,He seemed composed of contradictory elements.,m
9014,"On one hand, he seemed a man of the Napoleonic order, who would make everything and every person yield to his desires.",m
9015,"On the other, I judged him to be a man who wanted to be strictly honest and conscientious, a man who would not give up one iota of his convictions, even if by so doing he could gain the things he desired.",m
9016,"Although no plain statement was made at the dinner-table to that effect, I gathered that he had suffered socially because of his adherence to what he termed his Nonconformist principles, and that he would have taken his position among the county families had he not remained true to the Chapel he had attended as a boy.",m
9017,"On the other hand, however, that same Chapel, as it seemed to me, was a fetish rather than something which vitally affected his life.",m
9018,"I am spending some time in recording my impressions about this family, because I was brought into close contact with it in later days, and also because the various members of it affected me considerably.",m
9019,"""Yes,"" said Mr. Lethbridge, as we sat in the smoke-room, ""I am an old-fashioned man, Mr. Erskine.",m
9020,"I do not believe in giving up my early convictions simply because they are not popular.""",m
9021,"""What are your early convictions?"" asked Hugh.",m
9022,"""I mean my Nonconformist principles.",m
9023,"See what Methodism has done for Cornwall, see what it has done for the whole country for that matter.""",m
9024,"""Yes, what has it done?"" asked Hugh.",m

9044,Everything seems stereotyped.,m

9330,"Moreover, although I cannot explain it, a sense of dread possessed me.",m
9331,"I felt sure that something was going to happen, and that I was going to be at the centre of some untoward event.",m
9332,I expect I felt all the more irritable because my desire to live became stronger and stronger.,m

9419,"The day was beautifully fine, and, as I felt more than ordinarily well, I took a long route home.",m
9420,"I had not gone far when, passing a stile, I saw Miss Lethbridge leap lightly into the road.",m
9421,I could not help reflecting how handsome she appeared in her light summer attire.,m
9422,When visiting her father's house a few days before she had struck me as being hard and repellent.,m
9423,"Even now there was nothing winsome or girlish about her, but that she presented an attractive figure I could not deny.",m
9424,"More than ordinarily tall, and finely formed, she carried her well-fitting clothes to perfection.",m
9425,"Her features, too, while not exactly beautiful, were striking; and, flushed somewhat as she was by her walk through the fields, she seemed a part of that bright, early summer day.",m
9426,"""I hope you are better, Mr. Erskine,"" was her greeting.",m
9427,"""Yes,"" I replied, ""I feel well enough to take a fairly long walk.",m
9428,"I have been down into the village talking with some of the people there, and trying to discover some of the romance for which Cornwall is famous.""",m
9429,"""And have had your labor for your pains,"" was her reply.",m
9430,"""Not entirely.",m
9431,"I feel as though I have happened upon something which will lead to interesting developments.""",m
9432,"""Believe me, you will not, Mr. Erskine.""",m
9433,"""No?",m
9434,"Why?""",m
9435,"""If ever there was a false tradition, it is the tradition that Cornwall is romantic.",m
9436,"I have lived here all my life, and there is no more romance in the county than in that mine-heap,"" and she nodded towards a discarded mine which lay in the distance.",m
9437,"""The Cornish people,"" she went on, ""have no sense of the mysterious, no sense of the romantic.",m
9438,"If ever they had it, it has all died.",m
9439,"I suppose that years ago, when the people were entirely ignorant, they believed in all sorts of superstitions, but now that they are better educated they have discarded everything but what they can see, and feel with their own hands.",m
9440,"I am inclined to think they are right, too.""",m
9441,"""I am not so sure,"" was my answer.",m
9442,And then I told her of the conversation that had taken place a few moments before.,m
9443,"""And do you imagine, Mr. Erskine, that any romance surrounds the old man who built the house you live in, and lived like a hermit away there by the cliff?",m
9444,"Do you think that any romance is associated with the idiot lad who ran his errands and did his bidding?""",m
9445,"""Why not?""",m
9446,"""Because none exists.""",m
9447,"""Pardon me if I do not agree with you.",m
9448,"After all, there is something romantic in the thought of that old man coming there alone and building his hut in a lonely place, and spending years of his life there.""",m
9449,"""Yes, it may seem so; but, pardon me, is there anything romantic in your coming there, Mr. Erskine?""",m
9450,I shrugged my shoulders.,m
9451,"""I am afraid not,"" I replied.",m
9452,"""And I dare say the reason why he came there was just as unromantic.",m
9453,"As for Fever Lurgy, every village has its idiot who is a butt for rustic jokes.""",m
9454,"""And what about old Father Abraham's mysterious disappearance?""",m
9455,I asked.,m
9456,"""What you call a mysterious disappearance,"" was her reply, ""I regard as a sordid crime.",m
9457,"I expect the old man had a little money hoarded up, some tramps heard of it, and, for the sake of that money, murdered him and threw his body over the cliff.""",m
9458,"""At any rate,"" I said, ""it is more pleasant to think that some mystery surrounded his life, and that he left the neighborhood from some romantic cause.",m
9459,"Do you know, I am inclined to think that he is still alive, that he will turn up some day, and that the whole thing will be the talk of the countryside.""",m
9460,"""And yet you are a trained lawyer, and have lived in London!"" she laughed.",m
9461,"""Perhaps that is why.",m
9462,Lawyers get weary of hard thinking.,m
9463,"Besides, when one comes to think of it, hard thinking is only responsible for a tithe of the discovery of truth.",m
9464,"Far more of it is discovered by intuition than by logic.""",m
9465,"""Do you know, you are very refreshing, Mr. Erskine.",m
9466,"It is delightful to think of a man coming from hard, matter-of-fact London to Cornwall, and believing in the things that we simple rustics have discarded for a generation or more.""",m
9467,"""Then you don't find life either romantic or mysterious?""",m
9468,"""I find it the most prosy, uninteresting thing imaginable.",m
9469,"There is no mystery and no romance in the world; everything is hard, matter of fact, commonplace.""",m
9470,"""Come, come, now, you cannot believe that,"" I laughed.",m
9471,"""One believes as one finds.""",m
9472,And I thought her eyes became hard.,m
9473,"""The other day I read what is called a romantic novel.",m
9474,"It had gone through numberless editions, and was, I suppose, the rage of reading circles.",m
9475,It told of all sorts of mysterious happenings and romantic adventures.,m
9476,Then I reflected on what had actually happened to myself and to girls with whom I am acquainted.,m
9477,"I went to school in France and Germany, as well as in England, and, do you know, I really cannot find one bit of romance that has ever happened to me or to the girls I have known.",m
9478,"I can't remember anything mysterious.""",m
9479,"""Isn't life one great mystery?""",m
9480,"""Yes, mystery if you like, but simply because of our ignorance.",m
9481,"When the mystery is explained, the explanation is as prosy as that cottage.""",m
9482,"And she looked towards a cottage door, where a woman stood by her wash-tub.",m
9483,"""Do you ever find life mysterious, Mr. Erskine?""",m
9484,"""Yes, it is mysterious from end to end.",m
9485,"Sometimes, as I sit in my little wooden hut, facing the sea, at night-time, and hear the wind moan its way over the cliffs and across the waste of waters, when the solemn feeling of night broods over everything, I feel that life is one great mystery.",m
9486,What is behind it all?,m
9487,What is the meaning of everything?,m
9488,Is there a Creator?,m
9489,What lies beyond what we call death?,m
9490,"Surely, that is mystery enough.",m
9491,"You may say, if you like, that this feeling of mystery is because of our ignorance; nevertheless, it is there.""",m
9492,"""Yes,"" she replied.",m
9493,"""But the trouble is that, in so far as we have discovered mysteries, they turn out to be of the most prosy and commonplace nature.",m
9494,"Things that were once unknown, and appealed to the world as romantic, now that they are known are just as prosy and uninteresting as the commonplace.",m
9495,Directly a thing is known it becomes humdrum.,m
9496,"I went to a lecture one night given by a scientist--an astronomer, in fact.",m
9497,He was lecturing on the planet Mars.,m
9498,"He said that he himself had examined the planet through a powerful telescope, and he had seen what to him were convincing proofs that there were canals cut through a piece of land which was similar in nature to the Isthmus of Panama.",m
9499,"As a consequence the planet Mars was inhabited--inhabited by thinking, sentient beings, who lived in a world millions of miles from this world.",m
9500,"It seemed very wonderful at that time, but, when I came to think of it, it was all very prosy.",m
9501,What if it were inhabited?,m
9502,"It would simply mean that people somehow exist there, just as they exist here, and think and suffer, and struggle and die.",m
9503,"Can anything be more prosy and unromantic than that?""",m
9504,"""Isn't the very mystery of death itself attractive--wonderful?""",m
9505,I asked.,m
9506,"""Do you think so?""",m
9507,And she looked at me curiously.,m
9508,"""Sometimes,"" I replied, ""although I dread the thought of death, I have a kind of feverish curiosity about it, and I would like to die just to know.""",m
9509,"""Yet it would be disappointing in the end.",m
9510,"When that so-called mystery comes to be explained, there will be nothing but great, blank darkness.""",m
9511,"""And that is your creed of life and death?""",m
9512,"""We can only argue from the known to the unknown,"" was her reply.",m
9513,"""And do you not long for something more?""",m
9514,"""Long!""",m
9515,And there was passion in her voice.,m
9516,"""Then, to you, religion, immortality, have no interest?""",m
9517,"""Yes, interest,"" was her reply, ""but, like everything else, it is because of my ignorance.",m
9518,"I know I am very ignorant, Mr. Erskine, and I dare say you will laugh at me for talking in the way I do; but, so far as I have read of the origins of religions, they are simply the result of a fear of the unknown.",m
9519,"People are afraid to die, and they have evolved a sort of hope that there is a life other than this.",m
9520,"I know it is a cheerless creed, but don't facts bear out what I have said?",m
9521,"In different parts of the world are different religions, and each and all of them are characteristic of the people who believe in them.",m
9522,"Wasn't Matthew Arnold right when he said that the Greeks manufactured a god with classical features and golden hair, while the negroes created a god with black skin, thick lips, and woolly hair?""",m
9523,"""Do you go far enough back, even then?""",m
9524,I asked.,m
9525,"""You are simply dealing with the shape of the god.",m
9526,"What is the origin of the idea?""",m
9527,"""I suppose man invented it,"" was her reply.",m
9528,"""Yes, but how?",m
9529,"After all, knowledge is built upon other knowledge.",m
9530,Imagination is the play of the mind around ascertained facts.,m
9531,'No man hath seen God at any time.',m
9532,"How, then, have people come to believe in Him, except through some deeper and more wonderful faculty, which conveyed it to the mind?",m
9533,"For the mind, after all, is only the vehicle, and not the creator, of thought.""",m
9534,She shrugged her shoulders.,m
9535,"""You get beyond me there, Mr. Erskine.",m
9536,When you dabble in metaphysics I am lost.,m
9537,"Still, is it not a fact that the more intellectual the race the less religious it becomes?",m
9538,"Take France, for example.",m
9539,"Paris is the great clearing-house of ideas, and yet the French are an unbelieving people.""",m
9540,"""Is that altogether true?"" was my reply, for I was led to take up an attitude of the soundness of which I was far from being convinced.",m
9541,"""Is not France literally sick and tired of the atheism which surged over the nation at the time of the Revolution?",m
9542,"France no longer glories in hard unbelief, and, as far as I know, the French people are simply longing for faith, and, for that matter, are going back to faith.",m
9543,"Not, perhaps, the faith which the Revolution destroyed, but to something deeper, diviner.""",m
9544,"She seemed thoughtful, and for some time neither of us spoke.",m
9545,Then she burst out laughing merrily.,m
9546,"""Don't things seem reversed?"" she said.",m
9547,"""Here are you, a scholar of Oxford, and a clever lawyer, upholding tradition, imagination, intuition, superstition, while I, an ignorant girl, am discarding it all.""",m
9548,"""Perhaps,"" I replied, ""that is because life is long to you, short to me.",m
9549,"When one comes to what seems the end of things, one looks at life differently.",m
9550,"There,"" I went on, for at that moment we had passed a lad with his arm round a girl's waist, ""that boy lives in heaven.",m
9551,He is with the girl he loves.,m
9552,"Suppose you tried to convince that boy and girl there was no such thing as romance, would they believe you?""",m
9553,"""Perhaps not,"" she replied;",m
9554,"""but I could take you down the village yonder, and show you men and women who, twenty years ago, were just as romantic as those two cooing doves; and to-day the men loaf round the village lanes, smoking, or, perhaps, are in the public-house drinking; while the women are slatternly, discontented, standing at the wash-tub, or scrubbing out cottages.",m
9555,"Where now is the romance, or, for that matter, the love?""",m
9556,"""Then you don't believe in love either?""",m
9557,"She was silent, and I watched her face closely, and again I was struck by her appearance.",m
9558,"Yes, no doubt, Isabella Lethbridge was more than ordinarily handsome.",m
9559,"Her features, without being beautiful, were fine.",m
9560,The flash of her eyes betokened intelligence beyond the ordinary.,m
9561,"At that moment, too, there was a look in them which I had not seen before--a kind of longing, a sense of unsatisfaction, something wistful.",m
9562,"""Love?"" she repeated.",m
9563,"""No, I don't think I believe in it.""",m
9564,"""Surely,"" I said, ""that is going a little bit too far.""",m
9565,"""Yes, perhaps it is,"" was her answer.",m
9566,"""There is love--the love of a mother for her child.",m
9567,You see it everywhere.,m
9568,"A lion will fight for her whelps, a hen will protect her chickens.",m
9569,"But I suppose you were meaning the love which man has for a woman, and woman for man?""",m
9570,"""Yes,"" I replied, ""I was.",m
9571,"I was thinking of that lover and his lass whom we have just passed.""",m
9572,"""I do not know,"" she replied.",m
9573,"""All I know is that I never felt it, and yet I confess to being twenty-four.",m
9574,"It is an awful age, isn't it?",m
9575,Fancy a girl of twenty-four never having been in love!,m
9576,"Yet, facts are facts.",m
9577,"I do not deny that there is such a thing as affinity; but love, as I understand it, is, or ought to be, something spiritual, something divine, something which outlasts youth and all that youth means; something which defies the ravages of time, that laughs at impossibilities.",m
9578,"No. I do not believe there is such a thing.""",m
9579,"""Then what is the use of living?""",m
9580,I asked.,m
9581,"""I hardly know.",m
9582,"We have a kind of clinging to life, at least the great majority of us have, although I suppose in the more highly cultured States suicides are becoming more common.",m
9583,"We shudder at what we call death, and so we seek to live.",m
9584,"If, like the old Greeks, we surrounded death with beautiful thoughts----""  ""Ah yes,"" I interrupted;",m

9587,"""True,"" she replied.",m
9588,"""But where is the old Greek mythology now?",m
9589,It has become a thing of the past.,m
9590,"Mr. Erskine, will you forgive me for talking all this nonsense, for it is nonsense?",m
9591,I know I am floundering in a deep sea and saying foolish things.,m
9592,"Besides, I must leave you.",m
9593,"There is a house here where I must call.""",m
9594,"She held out her hand as she spoke, and looked at me.",m
9595,I felt as though she were trying to fascinate me.,m
9596,"For a second our eyes met, and I felt her hand quiver in mine.",m
9597,At that moment something was born in my mind and heart which I had never experienced before.,m
9598,"I confess it here, because probably no one will read these lines but myself.",m
9599,I felt towards Isabella Lethbridge as I had never felt towards any woman before.,m
9600,"Even in those days when I had flirted and danced and laughed with girls of my own age, and with whom I fancied myself in love, I had never felt towards a woman as I felt towards her.",m
9601,"""Good-day, Miss Lethbridge,"" I said, as I walked away.",m
9602,"""I hope you will come up to Trecarrel again soon,"" she said.",m
9603,"""Please don't wait for a formal invitation; we shall always be glad to see you.",m
9604,"At least, _I_ shall,"" and she gave me a bewildering smile.",m
9605,"I walked some little distance down the road, then turned and watched her till she was out of sight.",m
9606,I tried to analyze the new feelings which had come into my life.,m
9607,"""Why am I so interested in her?""",m
9608,I asked.,m
9609,"""What is this which has come to me so suddenly?",m
9610,"Whatever it is, it is not love.""",m
9611,"And I knew I spoke the truth, even as I know it now.",m
9612,Yet she fascinated me.,m
9613,"I reflected that her talk had been pedantic, the product of an ill-balanced mind, and, while she was clever, she was superficial.",m
9614,Yet she attracted me in a way I could not understand.,m
9615,"She had moved me as no other woman had moved me, but I knew, as I know now, that I was not in love with her.",m
9616,I walked slowly along.,m
9617,"We had come to the end of June, and the birds were singing gaily.",m
9618,Away in the distance I could see the sheen of the waves in the sunlight.,m
9619,The great line of cliffs stood out boldly; the world was very fair.,m
9620,A weight seemed to have rolled from my shoulders.,m
9621,"Oh, it was good to live--good to bask in the sunlight on that summer day!",m
9622,I laughed aloud.,m
9623,No romance! no mystery! no religion! no love!,m
9624,"The girl had almost made me believe in what she had said, although at the back of my mind I felt it was all wrong.",m
9625,"I looked at my watch, and knew that I must be returning, or Simpson would be anxious about me.",m
9626,He had become quite paternal in his care.,m
9627,I descended the steep hill towards the little copse at the back of my house.,m
9628,"Once or twice I stopped and listened to the waves as they rolled on the hard, yellow beach, while the sea-gulls hovered over the great beetling cliffs.",m
9629,"""I won't die!""",m
9630,I cried.,m
9631,"""I simply won't!""",m
9632,"And yet I knew at the time that death had taken possession of me, was even then gnawing away at the centre of my life.",m
9633,I entered the little copse and drew near to the house.,m
9634,"I had gone, perhaps, twenty yards, when I stopped.",m
9635,"Peering at me through the leaves of the bushes, which grew thick on the side of the cliff, was a pair of gleaming eyes.",m
9636,"They seemed to me to be the eyes of a madman, a maniac.",m
9637,"Perhaps my imagination was excited, and my mind unbalanced, but I thought I saw revenge, hatred, murder.",m
9638,The eyes were large and staring.,m
9639,"I could see no face, no form.",m
9640,"I felt no fear, only a sense of wonder and a desire to know.",m
9641,"I took a step in the direction of those wild, maniacal orbs, and I heard a cry--hoarse, agonized.",m
9642,"I took another step forward and looked again, and saw nothing, neither did I hear another sound.",m
9643,"Feverishly I made my way towards the spot, but there was nothing there.",m
9644,"No footmarks could I discover, no signs of any one having been there.",m
9645,"I am perfectly certain I saw what I have described, as sure as that I am sitting in my little room at this moment, but although I searched everywhere I could discover nothing.",m
9646,"I returned to my house and began to dress for dinner; but all the while I was haunted by those wild, staring eyes.",m
9647,"VIII  MYSTERY   ""Simpson,"" I said, after dinner, ""do you believe in ghosts?""",m
9648,"""Yes, sir, I think so, sir.""",m
9649,"""What are your views about them?""",m
9650,"""Well, sir, I don't know that I could put them into words.",m
9651,"Will you have your coffee now, sir?""",m
9652,"""Yes, please, Simpson; and will you pass my cigar-box?""",m
9653,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
9654,"""You are somewhat of a philosopher, aren't you, Simpson?""",m
9655,"""In my own way, sir.",m
9656,"If I hadn't been I should have been dead before now.""",m
9657,"""Oh, indeed,"" I said.",m
9658,"""How?""",m
9659,"""Well, sir, it was during the two years I was married.",m
9660,"It was my philosophy that saved me.""",m
9661,"""In what way?""",m
9662,I asked.,m
9663,"""Well, you see, sir, I hadn't been married more than a month before I discovered that my wife had a remarkable command of language.",m
9664,"While we were courting, she pretended to be shy, and had very little to say; but when we got married she developed the power of speech awful, sir--just awful.",m
9665,"At first I answered her back, and every time I spoke I seemed, as it were, to open up the fountains of the great deep, until I thought I was going mad.",m
9666,"Then I got to thinking about it, sir, and after careful study of my wife's character I came to the conclusion that the only way I could meet her was by silence.",m
9667,"I didn't smoke at that time, sir, she having said as how she hated smoking; but I bought a pipe and tobacco, and every time she started talking I just loaded up my pipe and commenced smoking.",m
9668,"I didn't say a word, sir, but let her go on and on.""",m
9669,"""Well,"" I asked, ""did that cure her?""",m
9670,"""Not at first, sir; for a time she was worse than ever, and I thought I should have to give it up.",m
9671,"That was where my philosophy came in, sir;",m
9672,I just held on.,m
9673,"The more she talked the more I smoked, never uttering a word.""",m
9674,"""Yes,"" I said, ""and what then?""",m
9675,"""She began to cry, sir.",m
9676,She cried and cried until I thought she was going to cry her eyes out.,m
9677,"I almost gave in, but being a philosopher I still kept quiet.",m
9678,"After that, she began to threaten what she would do.",m
9679,"She rampaged round the house like a mad woman, but I only bought a new pipe.""",m
9680,"""And did you master her that way?""",m
9681,"""No, sir;",m
9682,I never mastered her.,m
9683,"It is my belief that if a woman has got the gift of the gab as she had, she never can be mastered.",m
9684,"But she left me, sir.""",m
9685,"""I thought you told me she was dead, Simpson?""",m
9686,"""Oh, no, sir;",m
9687,I never told you that;,m
9688,I only told you that I had a wife for two years.,m
9689,"Yes, sir, she kept with me for two years, trying to break me down.",m
9690,"Then, one day, when I came into the house I found a letter from her.",m
9691,"She said that she could not live with a brute who would not answer her back, so she went off on her own.""",m
9692,"""And what did you do then, Simpson?""",m
9693,"""I went to live with your father, sir, and I have lived with the family ever since.",m
9694,But it was my philosophy which saved my life.,m
9695,"If I had given in she would have killed me.""",m
9696,"""And where is she now, Simpson?""",m
9697,"""I don't know, sir, and I don't want to.",m
9698,"Yes, sir, nothing but philosophy will master a woman.""",m
9699,"""Well, to come back to where we were, Simpson.",m
9700,"You being a philosopher, have you any explanation to offer as to ghosts?""",m
9701,"""Well, sir, not ever having seen one, I don't see how I can.",m
9702,If I had seen one I might answer.,m
9703,"Have you seen one, sir?""",m
9704,"""Yes, Simpson.",m
9705,"This evening, just before coming in to dinner, I was coming along the footpath through the copse, when I saw a pair of bright, staring eyes, like the eyes of a madman.",m
9706,There was no doubt about it;,m
9707,I am certain I saw them.,m
9708,"I could make out no face, but I am certain I saw the eyes.",m
9709,When I went to the place where I saw them I could find nothing.,m
9710,"What is your opinion about it?""",m
9711,"Simpson thought a minute, then he replied solemnly:  ""It was an 'allucination, sir.""",m
9712,"""Was it that, Simpson?""",m
9713,"""Well, sir, if you will excuse me for asking, who had you been with before you saw the eyes?",m
9714,Had you spoken to any one?,m
9715,"Had you been talking about ghosts, or that sort of thing?""",m
9716,"""No, Simpson;",m
9717,"I had been talking with Miss Lethbridge, a young lady who does not believe in ghosts.""",m
9718,"""Ah, that explains, sir.""",m
9719,"""How, Simpson?""",m
9720,"""A woman always upsets the mind--always.",m
9721,"If you had said you had seen the face without the eyes, I could perhaps have believed you; but when you say you saw eyes without a face, and then tell me you had been talking with a young lady, I know just what is the matter.""",m
9722,"""Yes; but, Simpson, that is not all.",m
9723,I heard an awful moan.,m
9724,"Rather more than a moan--it was a kind of moan and cry combined.""",m
9725,"""And did you hear any rustling in the bushes, sir?""",m
9726,"""Not a sound.""",m
9727,"""Ah, well, sir, I stand by my opinion.",m
9728,"Anything more you want, sir?""",m
9729,"""Nothing more, thank you.""",m
9730,And Simpson went away into the kitchen.,m
9731,"He had not been gone long, when I heard footsteps outside, and shortly after young Hugh Lethbridge appeared.",m
9732,"""You don't mind my calling, do you, Erskine?"" he said.",m
9733,"""On the contrary, I am delighted,"" I replied.",m
9734,"""I have just been talking with my man about something which I saw this evening, and he can offer no explanation.",m
9735,"Perhaps you can.""",m
9736,And I told him what I had seen.,m
9737,"""By Gum!"" he said, ""that's funny.",m
9738,"You are sure you are not mistaken, Erskine?""",m
9739,"""Impossible,"" I replied.",m
9740,"""I saw those eyes as plainly as I see you.",m
9741,"It was not dark--the sun had not set, for that matter.""",m
9742,"""And were you excited in any way?""",m
9743,And he looked at me steadily.,m
9744,"""No,"" I replied;",m
9745,"""I was not excited.""",m
9746,"""It's funny.",m
9747,"You don't imagine, do you, that there was anything supernatural about it?""",m
9748,"""I wish I did, but I am sorry to say that I have no faith whatever in the supernatural.""",m
9749,"""No,"" he said;",m
9750,"""I remember what you told us up at Trecarrel.",m
9751,"And you searched the place thoroughly?""",m
9752,"""Yes, thoroughly.",m
9753,"You see, I was curious.""",m
9754,"""And you had not been thinking about supernatural things?""",m
9755,"""Not in the least.",m
9756,"For that matter, I had a few minutes before met your sister.""",m
9757,"""Oh, yes;",m
9758,"Bella told me she had met you, and was afraid she had shocked you.""",m
9759,"""No, I was not shocked at all;",m
9760,"I was very interested.""",m
9761,"""Bella is a curious girl,"" said Hugh Lethbridge, after a short silence.",m
9762,"""We have always been very good friends, but I have never understood her.",m
9763,"Even when she was quite a girl she was different from those of her own age.""",m
9764,"""In what way?""",m
9765,"""She was always so hard, so matter of fact.",m
9766,"I have told her more than once that she has no soul.""",m
9767,"He said the words lightly, but to me they were ominous with meaning.",m
9768,He had put into words what I had felt.,m
9769,"""I suppose I ought not to say this,"" went on Hugh;",m
9770,"""but I don't feel towards you as I do towards other men.",m
9771,I don't know why it is.,m
9772,No sooner did I see you than I wanted to have you as a friend;,m
9773,I felt I could trust you.,m
9774,"You don't mind my saying this, do you?""",m
9775,"""Rather it is awfully good of you.""",m
9776,"""I am a lonely kind of fellow,"" he went on, ""and my home life has shut me off from the society of those I might care for.",m
9777,"Other fellows invite their college chums to stay with them, and all that kind of thing, but the pater never allowed me to do it.",m
9778,"Why, I don't know.",m
9779,"I know it is wrong to discuss one's people before a stranger, but, as I said just now, I don't feel you are a stranger.",m
9780,"What do you think of my father, Erskine?""",m
9781,"""I think he is a strong, capable man,"" I replied.",m
9782,"""Yes, there is no doubt about that.",m
9783,"Why, years ago he was only a poor lad, living in a district where there seemed to be very few chances of a lad making his way, and yet you see what he has done.",m
9784,He was a clerk in the office of a man who had to do with shipping in Penzance.,m
9785,"Only in a small way, you know, but he gave my father the chance to learn the business.",m
9786,He did learn it.,m
9787,What the pater doesn't know about shipping isn't worth knowing.,m
9788,To-day he owns scores of vessels.,m
9789,"He got into touch with the mining world, too, and he seemed to possess a sort of genius for fastening on to mines that would pay.",m
9790,"He has not only a controlling interest in the few prosperous Cornish mines, but he is connected with the mining world in almost every country where mines are to be found.",m
9791,"He is as keen as a razor, is the pater, and has a way of making his will felt everywhere.",m
9792,"""And yet he is a most conscientious man.",m
9793,"That is, conscientious in his own way.",m
9794,He used to be very religious.,m
9795,"He used to pray at the Chapel, and all that sort of thing, but he's given it up now.",m
9796,But he holds to the form of religion still.,m
9797,"As you heard him say the other night, he is a very strong believer in democracy.",m
9798,"On the other hand, a greater autocrat never lived.",m
9799,"In reality he believes in the feudal system, even while he professes to scorn what we call aristocracy.",m
9800,"Yes, I see you smile.",m
9801,Never was a man more anxious to associate with county families than he.,m
9802,But he never yields an inch to them.,m
9803,"If he had, he would have been admitted into what is called county society.",m
9804,"Even as it is, Squire Treherne seems to be afraid of him.""",m
9805,"""How is that?""",m
9806,I asked.,m
9807,"""Oh, he pays deference to his opinions; always supports him in public matters, and all that sort of thing.",m
9808,I am inclined to think that the pater has old Treherne in his power.,m
9809,"You will not say anything about this, will you, Erskine?",m
9810,"I do not believe my father cares a fig about me,"" he added.",m
9811,"""Nonsense!""",m
9812,I replied.,m
9813,"""I don't really.",m
9814,In a way he is interested in me.,m
9815,"I suppose it is because blood is thicker than water, but do you know I can never remember the time when he kissed me, or anything of that sort.",m
9816,"He always tried to rule me with a rod of iron.""",m
9817,"""And has he treated your sister in the same way?""",m
9818,I asked.,m
9819,"""Yes, and no. Do you know, Erskine, my sister is a strange girl.""",m
9820,I was silent.,m
9821,I felt I had no right to ask the question which rose in my mind.,m
9822,"""What do you think of Bella?"" he asked suddenly.",m
9823,"He did not seem to realize that he was overstepping the bounds of good taste in asking me, a stranger, such a question, and I realized more than ever that he was only an impulsive boy, although he had reached man's estate.",m
9824,"Indeed, in one sense, Hugh did not know what it was to be reserved, and yet in others he was strangely reticent.",m
9825,"I thought he seemed to be about to take me further into his confidence at this point, but, perhaps noting the non-committal nature of my reply, he desisted.",m
9826,"""Of course, she's a bundle of contradictions,"" he said;",m
9827,"""but she's really splendid.",m
9828,"Why, on the day after she'd--but, there, I mustn't tell you about that.",m
9829,"Anyhow, there was an accident at Pendeen Mine.",m
9830,Two men were believed to be in danger of drowning by the flooding of the old workings.,m
9831,"The miners had made every attempt--at least, so they said--to rescue them, and to do anything more would be to throw away their own lives.""",m
9832,"""Yes,"" I said.",m
9833,"""What then?""",m
9834,"""Bella went to them and talked to them as they had never been talked to before.",m
9835,"She laughed all their protests to scorn, and when they proved to her that, humanly speaking, they had done all that men could do, she insisted upon going down the mine herself.",m
9836,"It was the maddest thing a woman could do, and God only knows how she did it; but she rescued the miners.",m
9837,"Why, it was in all the newspapers.",m
9838,"Yes, Bella is magnificent, but--but----""  Hugh Lethbridge was silent for some time after this, neither did I speak.",m
9839,I was thinking of the impression she had made on me when I first saw her.,m
9840,"""She was never like other girls, even when she was a child,"" he went on.",m
9841,"""She did not care for games--that is, ordinary children's games--so, although she is only two years older than I, we were never what you call playfellows.",m
9842,"She is a very brainy girl, too, and by the time she was fourteen had read all sorts of out-of-the-way books.""",m
9843,"""I wonder she did not go to Somerville or Girton when she left school.""",m
9844,"""That's what she wanted,"" replied Lethbridge, ""but the pater said he did not believe in women going to a university.",m
9845,He has always maintained that this modern craze about advanced education for women is so much nonsense.,m
9846,"Still, Bella is an educated girl.",m
9847,"She speaks French and German and Italian fluently, and there is scarcely a classical writer in these languages whom she has not read first hand.",m
9848,"Yes, Bella is a strange girl, but very hard.""",m
9849,Again there was a silence between us for some seconds.,m
9850,"""She is not at all like mother,"" went on Lethbridge.",m
9851,"""I wish she were.",m
9852,"Although, as you saw the other night, we teased mother about being general manager of the world, there is scarcely a family in the parish which mother has not helped in one way or another, and in a way she is very popular; but no one would think of going to Bella in trouble.""",m
9853,"I must confess that I wanted to ask more questions about her, but refrained from so doing.",m
9854,"After all, it would not have been good taste on my part.",m
9855,"""Well, I must be going now,"" said Lethbridge presently, rising from his chair.",m
9856,"""I am glad I have seen you.",m
9857,"Our chat, somehow, has done me good, although I have done most of the talking.",m
9858,"I was awfully restless after dinner to-night, and the walk here, and seeing you, have made me feel better.",m
9859,"By the way""--and I saw that this was what he had really come for--""I spoke to you about Mary Treleaven the other night.""",m
9860,"""Yes, I remember.""",m
9861,"""I have had a row with the pater about her to-day.""",m
9862,"""I am sorry for that.""",m
9863,"""It was bound to come.",m
9864,"You see, he will not hear of my marrying her.",m
9865,"He says it would be pure madness on my part, and if I will not fall in with his wishes he will not give me a penny.",m
9866,I should like to introduce you to Mary;,m
9867,"I told you so, didn't I?",m
9868,"Will you let me?""",m
9869,"""If you like, certainly,"" I replied;",m
9870,"""but really, Lethbridge, I cannot help you in that matter.",m
9871,"I would not, even if I could.",m
9872,"It would not be right.""",m
9873,"""If you knew her you would,"" he said, with boyish eagerness.",m
9874,"""She's the finest, sweetest girl in the country, and she is the only one I could be happy with.",m
9875,"As for the pater's ideas, I won't fall in with them--I won't.""",m
9876,"He went to the door as he spoke, and looked out over the sea.",m
9877,"""It's a glorious night,"" he said;",m
9878,"""there is not a cloud in the sky, and the light of the moon transforms everything into a fairyland.""",m
9879,"I went to his side as he spoke, and as I did so a kind of shiver passed through me.",m
9880,"The night was, indeed, wonderful.",m
9881,"The moon shone so brightly that no stars appeared, and I could see the long line of cliffs stretching northward.",m
9882,"Scarcely a breath of wind stirred, and I could hear the waves lapping musically on the hard yellow beach beneath.",m
9883,"""I will walk a few steps with you, Lethbridge,"" I said.",m
9884,"""I will not go far.",m
9885,But really this is not an evening to spend indoors.,m
9886,"How I wish I were strong and healthy!""",m
9887,"Putting on a summer overcoat, I walked with him along the footpath through the copse, and when at length we reached the open country, where heather-covered moorland stretched away on either side, both of us stopped and listened.",m
9888,"""What a noise the silence is making!"" said Lethbridge.",m
9889,"""Did you ever hear anything like it?""",m
9890,"""No,"" I said, ""the hush is simply wonderful.""",m
9891,"Scarcely had we spoken, when rising suddenly before us was the form of a man, and again those strange eyes, which had haunted me for hours, flashed before me.",m
9892,The man moved so quickly that I could not discern his features.,m
9893,He uttered a cry as he went--a cry similar to that I heard in the copse hours before.,m
9894,"""Do you know who it is?""",m
9895,I asked.,m
9896,"""No,"" replied Lethbridge.",m
9897,"""Strange, isn't it?""",m
9898,"""Anyhow, it explains what I saw this afternoon.",m
9899,"It might seem as though some one were watching me.""",m
9900,"""I will follow him, if you like,"" said Lethbridge, ""and find out who it is.""",m
9901,"""Oh, no, don't trouble; very possibly it means nothing.",m
9902,"But I think my mind must be excited, after all.",m
9903,"I will go back now, if you don't mind.",m
9904,"Good-night.""",m
9905,"And I went slowly back to my little hut, wondering what the apparition might mean.",m
9906,"IX  AT THE VICARAGE   On my return to my room, I naturally reflected upon what young Hugh Lethbridge had told me.",m
9907,"It may seem strange that, on such a short acquaintance, he spoke to me so freely about his family, but what I have written down is, as far as I can remember, exactly what took place.",m
9908,"Hugh Lethbridge was scarcely twenty-three, and, although he looked older, was little more than a lad.",m
9909,"He was the child of his mother rather than of his father, and was lacking in anything like secretiveness, especially to any one whom he liked.",m
9910,"For some reason or another I had seemed to captivate him, so much so that he opened his heart and gave his confidence more fully than was natural on such a short acquaintance.",m
9911,"In many respects young Lethbridge was sensitive and self-contained, but in other ways he was so impulsive that he overstepped the bounds of good taste.",m
9912,"I got to know him better afterwards, and found that, although he had spoken so freely to me, he was regarded by many as reserved.",m
9913,"Besides, he was hungering for sympathy, and because he thought I sympathized with him his confidences were so personal that I almost felt uncomfortable.",m
9914,"Nevertheless, I pondered a great deal over what he had told me.",m
9915,"Evidently the household at Trecarrel was not altogether happy, and an estrangement existed between Mr. Lethbridge senior and his son.",m
9916,"As for Isabella Lethbridge, she presented an interesting study to me.",m
9917,"As I have said, she appealed to me as no other woman had ever appealed to me before.",m
9918,"For the moment I had thought I was in love with her, but, on reflection, I knew I was not.",m
9919,I was able to study her character calmly and think of her in a kind of detached way.,m
9920,She formed no part in my life.,m
9921,"She was an interesting specimen of humanity, whom I took pleasure in analyzing, but the feeling I had towards her was not love.",m
9922,Rather she repelled me even while she fascinated me.,m
9923,"The thought of her never caused my heart to throb, nor made the blood course through my veins one whit the faster.",m
9924,"Besides, it was not for me to think about such things.",m
9925,I had come down to Cornwall to die.,m
9926,"In a few months the spark of my life would go out, and I should enter the great darkness.",m
9927,"Days and weeks passed away, and very little of importance happened worthy of record.",m
9928,Often I reflected upon the uselessness of my life.,m
9929,"Why, after all, should I live?",m
9930,"No one but Simpson was really interested in me, and only he would grieve when I had gone; then again the old revulsion against becoming nothing surged within me.",m
9931,"I had hopes, longings, intimations which seemed to overleap the boundaries of time and sense.",m
9932,"If this life were all, then life was a mockery, a promise without possible fulfilment, a hope born only to be disappointed.",m
9933,"Sitting there alone night after night, hearing the cry of the sea-birds, listening to the wail of the wind as it swept over hill and dale, or found its way across the great waste of waters, I asked a thousand questions and pondered over the problems of life and death, without ever receiving one single ray of light.",m
9934,"Sometimes I became so lonely that I called Simpson into my room and talked with him, but I never allowed him to know how dark were the prospects which faced me.",m
9935,"The questions I asked him, I remember, were almost flippant in their nature.",m
9936,"I made a joke of death, as I tried to make a joke of everything else; so much so that I fancied Simpson was convinced that I did not trouble.",m
9937,"After all, why should I worry the poor, simple-minded fellow with questions which he could not answer or understand?",m
9938,"The best thing to do was to bear everything with a kind of stoicism, and to make a jest of what really haunted me night and day with strange persistency.",m
9939,"Indeed, I think I sometimes rather pained Simpson with my flippant remarks, for I found that the beliefs of his boyhood were still powerful in his life.",m
9940,It is difficult to eradicate the impressions of youth.,m
9941,"""After all, Simpson,"" I said one day, ""sleep is a good thing providing one has no bad dreams, and if I sleep for ever I shall know nothing about it.""",m
9942,"""But if one should dream, sir?"" suggested Simpson.",m
9943,"""You are quoting Hamlet,"" I said.",m
9944,"""I don't know the gentleman you refer to,"" was Simpson's somewhat indignant reply;",m
9945,"""indeed, I never heard of him.",m
9946,"But don't you think, sir, that education and cleverness are very poor things?""",m
9947,"""Doubtless, Simpson.",m
9948,"But why do you say so?""",m
9949,"""Why, sir, here are you, a gentleman who has been to college and all that.",m
9950,"You were spoken of in the newspapers as one who would do great things some day, and yet you don't know as much as my old father did, who never had a day's schooling in his life.""",m
9951,"""How is that, Simpson?""",m
9952,"""Well, sir, he _knew_ there was a life after death.",m
9953,"He saw the angels, sir.""",m
9954,"""Did he tell you so, Simpson?""",m
9955,"""Yes, sir, he did.",m
9956,"He was a very ignorant man, sir, but he knew.",m
9957,"Besides, sir--excuse me for saying so--but aren't your opinions very foolish, sir?""",m
9958,"""I dare say,"" I replied.",m

10545,"I imagined that he had lost a lot of money, and he saw the possibility of losing more.",m
10546,"The fact, too, that Hugh, his only son, was not interested in his schemes, angered him.",m
10547,"""I say, Erskine,"" said Hugh, just before my leaving the house, ""you have no objection to my bringing Mary Treleaven over to see you to-morrow night?",m
10548,"I want you to know her.""",m
10549,"""I shall be delighted,"" was my reply.",m
10550,"""But do you think you are wise in opposing your father?""",m
10551,"""How can I help opposing him?"" asked Hugh.",m
10552,"""I am of age, and I have my own life to live.",m
10553,"She is the only girl in the world to me, and I am not going to live in misery because of the pater's fads.""",m
10554,As I left I had a few seconds alone with Isabella Lethbridge.,m
10555,"""You have been bored to death, Mr. Erskine,"" she said.",m
10556,"""No, don't try to deny it.",m
10557,"You have played your part very well, but your boredom is written on your face.",m
10558,"I don't wonder at it.""",m
10559,"""Then I apologize for an unforgetable breach of good manners.",m
10560,"But did I seem bored when I was talking to you?""",m
10561,"""No, you did not; but please, Mr. Erskine, don't go away with a false impression about me.""",m
10562,"""I hope it is not false,"" I said, ""for it is a very pleasant one.""",m
10563,"""That is awfully poor,"" she replied, ""and certainly it is not worthy of you.""",m
10564,"And then she flashed a look into my eyes which, I must confess, set my heart beating violently.",m
10565,"""Perhaps the next time you come, Mr. Erskine, we may have pleasanter things to talk about.""",m
10566,"I went home feeling that my evening had been ill-spent, and yet I was not sure.",m
10567,I felt somehow that forces were at work in my life which were going to make a change in me.,m
10568,"Why, I did not know.",m
10569,"It is said that when people are near death, the horizon of their vision becomes widened, that the barriers which have hitherto bounded their sight break down.",m
10570,Was that so with me?,m
10571,"I did not know why it was, but I felt as though I were on the brink of some discovery.",m
10572,I had no reason for this.,m
10573,My thoughts were rather intuitional than logical.,m
10574,When I reached my little home I reflected upon what had taken place.,m
10575,I tried to gather up the impressions which had been made upon me since I had been in St.,m
10576,Issey.,m
10577,"I was obliged to confess, too, that Isabella Lethbridge was right in many of the things she had said.",m
10578,"I had come to Cornwall, supposed to be a religious county, and yet, as far as I could see, the religion of both Church and Chapel was something that existed only on the surface.",m
10579,There was very little that went down to the depths of life.,m
10580,I had been to Chapel several times since the service I have described.,m
10581,"I had also been repeatedly to the Parish Church, but I never found the thing I wanted.",m
10582,"The note of conviction, of reality, was always wanting.",m
10583,"The people were so awfully comfortable, so completely self-satisfied; the life of every one seemed to be laid over with a thick covering of materialism.",m
10584,"There was no general doubt about spiritual things, but there was a lack of consciousness.",m
10585,Men and women appeared to be careless about what they pretended to accept.,m
10586,"I discovered, too, that people went to Church and to Chapel rather as a matter of form and custom than because they entered into communion with the Unseen and the Eternal.",m
10587,"Next evening Hugh Lethbridge brought Mary Treleaven to see me, and directly we met I did not wonder at the young fellow's determination.",m
10588,"If I have portrayed his character correctly, I have shown him to be a simple-minded, impulsive lad, who cared little for rank or riches; one who obeyed the promptings of his heart, rather than the findings of his reason.",m
10589,"No one could associate Hugh with Mr. Worldly Wiseman, and surely Mary Treleaven was a fit mate for such a man.",m
10590,"As far as I can judge, she was about twenty years of age, unsophisticated and true-hearted.",m
10591,"That she almost worshipped Hugh was evident, and that she stood in awe of his father was just as apparent.",m
10592,"I judged, too, that Hugh had been very enthusiastic in his praises about me, for she seemed to regard me, comparative stranger though I was, as a very dear friend of her lover, and when for a few minutes Hugh left us together, she opened her heart to me.",m
10593,"""You know, Mr. Erskine,"" she said simply, ""I know that as far as money and position and all that sort of thing goes, I am not Hugh's equal.",m
10594,"My father is only a tenant farmer, and I am afraid they up at Trecarrel think that I just look on him as a good catch; but really, Mr. Erskine, it is not that at all.",m
10595,"I almost hope they won't give him any money, and I wish, oh, I wish he was only just a simple farmer like my father!",m
10596,"I don't care a bit about the money.""",m
10597,"""I am quite sure you don't,"" I said.",m
10598,"""You care only for Hugh.""",m
10599,"""Oh, you see that, don't you?""",m
10600,"""Indeed I do,"" I replied.",m
10601,"""Do you know,"" she went on, as artlessly as a child, ""that I have prayed about it for hours.",m
10602,"I thought it my duty to give him up; indeed, I have offered to do so more than once, but Hugh won't hear of it.",m
10603,"But, after all, why should I, Mr. Erskine?",m
10604,"I love him and he loves me, and I am not afraid to work for him.",m
10605,"Why, only give me a chance, and I will work my fingers to the bone for him,"" and the tears started to her eyes.",m
10606,I loved to hear her talk.,m
10607,"She had that peculiar, soft intonation, common to the fairly-well-educated people in Cornwall.",m
10608,"She spoke perfectly correctly, but the Cornish accent, which I had learnt to love--that peculiar, sing-song lilt--was manifest in every sentence she uttered.",m
10609,"""Do you know, Mr. Erskine,"" she went on, ""I have been up to see Mrs. Lethbridge?""",m
10610,"""Oh!""",m
10611,I said;,m
10612,"""and did you have a reason for doing that?""",m
10613,"""Yes,"" she said.",m
10614,"""I thought it right just to let her know what I felt.",m
10615,"Hugh is talking about emigrating to Canada, and I am sure that if he went he would succeed there, and I am willing to wait five, ten years; it doesn't matter how long.",m
10616,"You see, Mr. Erskine, I never loved any one else.""",m
10617,"""And what did Mrs. Lethbridge say to you?""",m
10618,"""Oh, at first she didn't seem to like me, and, as I thought, was angry; but after a bit she got quite pleasant, and Hugh says that she has some money of her own, and that she is willing to give it to him, so that he can start a small farm of his own.",m
10619,"You think it would be right, don't you?""",m
10620,"""Think what would be right?""",m
10621,I asked.,m
10622,"""For him to go against his father, and take it.",m
10623,"It isn't as though I wanted Hugh for his money, Mr. Erskine, I only want him for himself, and he wants me.""",m
10624,"""I am sure that your motives are perfectly pure,"" was my reply, ""but you must remember that Hugh is his father's only son, and it is a very grave thing for a boy to disobey his father's wishes.""",m
10625,"""Yes, I know, and that is what has made me so miserable.",m
10626,We should have been married before now but for that.,m
10627,"I am so glad, Mr. Erskine, that you don't think badly about me.""",m
10628,"""Think badly about you?""",m
10629,"I said, with a laugh.",m
10630,"""That would be impossible.",m
10631,"I only congratulate Hugh on his good luck, and I jolly well wish I had his chance.""",m
10632,"""Now you are laughing at me.""",m
10633,"""Good gracious!",m
10634,"No, I am not laughing at you.""",m
10635,"And I suppose I sighed, for she looked at me curiously.",m
10636,"""Oh, forgive me, Mr. Erskine.",m
10637,I did not think!,m
10638,Hugh has told me all about you.,m
10639,"Perhaps it isn't as bad as you believe.""",m
10640,"""Well, it is no use worrying,"" I replied, ""and, believe me, I am awfully glad to have met you.",m
10641,"Ah, here is Hugh coming.""",m
10642,"""You don't advise me to give him up, do you?""",m
10643,"""No, of course not!""",m
10644,"I said; and I meant it, for this dark-haired, soft-eyed girl had made a strong appeal to me, and I had been perfectly sincere when I said that I envied Hugh Lethbridge.",m
10645,"What, after all, were rank and position?",m
10646,"What was anything compared with the love of a pure girl like that, and I, whose death-warrant was written, felt a great pain in my heart, as I reflected that the love of such a girl would never be known to me, that I should die in ignorance of what it could mean.",m
10647,"""Hugh thinks so much of you, and he is so proud that you are his friend,"" she went on.",m
10648,"""He says you were awfully clever at college, and that if you live you will make a great name for yourself.",m
10649,He says he never felt towards any one like he feels towards you.,m
10650,"Oh, it would be lovely if you got well, and could be our neighbor and be near us always.""",m
10651,"I saw the tears roll down her face as she said this, and I, who have never known what it is to have a sister, felt towards her as, I think, brothers feel towards a sister whom they love.",m
10652,"""You don't think badly of me, do you?"" she went on.",m
10653,And I could see a look of longing in her eyes.,m
10654,"""What makes you ask such a question?""",m
10655,I said.,m
10656,"""Oh, Hugh says his father has quite taken to you too, and thinks a great deal of your opinion.",m
10657,"I wonder if--if----""  ""I am afraid Hugh is mistaken,"" I said.",m
10658,"""But if any word of mine can soften his heart----""  ""Oh, you are good!"" she interrupted impulsively, ""and you don't think that Hugh would be throwing himself away on me, do you?""",m
10659,"""Throwing himself away?""",m
10660,"I cried, and at that moment I thought of Miss Treherne, whom I had seen at Church on the previous Sunday morning, and mentally I compared them.",m
10661,The Squire's daughter was a staid-looking spinster of about thirty years of age.,m
10662,"She had never been beautiful, and no one by the utmost stretch of imagination could call her attractive.",m
10663,"""If I were Hugh,"" I said, ""I would not give you up for anything or anybody, and I should regard myself as the luckiest fellow in the world to get you.""",m
10664,She laughed like a child.,m
10665,"It was easy to see that I had gladdened her heart, and when a few minutes later she walked away hanging on her lover's arm, I heaved a sigh of envy.",m
10666,"""They are right, both of them,"" I said to myself.",m
10667,"""What is all the money in the world, and all the rank, compared to the infinite trustfulness and affection of those two?",m
10668,"""Surely God, if there is a God, wants them to be happy,"" I reflected, and I formed a sort of quixotic resolution that I would speak to Mr. Lethbridge, and try to persuade him to withdraw his opposition to his son's marriage with this pure, sweet, simple-minded country girl.",m
10669,"I did not carry my resolution into effect, however.",m
10670,"The next day I suffered a kind of reaction from the little excitement caused by what had taken place, and immediately afterwards it seemed as though all my thoughts and resolutions were scattered to the wind.",m
10671,"""Please, sir,"" said Simpson, entering my room, ""here's the paper, sir.",m

10674,"""Yes, sir; war is declared, sir.""",m
10675,"I took the paper from his hand, feeling strangely heavy-hearted, and on opening it, saw, staring me in large letters:         ""ENGLAND DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY.",m

10677,ENGLAND DECIDES TO RISK ALL FOR HONOR.,m
10678,"GREAT SCENE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.           THE WHOLE NATION UNANIMOUS.""",m
10679,"No sooner had I read this, than a strange calm came upon me, and I scanned the paper in a detached sort of way.",m
10680,I seemed to have nothing to do with it;,m
10681,I was cut off from everything.,m
10682,"I read what had been written, rather as one who read the history of another country, than as something which vitally affected England.",m
10683,In a way I had expected it.,m
10684,"My conversation at Trecarrel had somewhat prepared me, and yet events had moved so rapidly, that declaration of war came like a shock.",m
10685,"The whole story was set forth in the newspapers, and from the dispatches it was made plain that, while Germany had hoped that England would remain neutral, and had been willing to offer bribes for our neutrality, she had planned this war, and made arrangements for it.",m
10686,"There was no doubt that she believed both Russia and France to be entirely unprepared, and that both she and Austria were prepared.",m
10687,"It was plain too that unless we were willing to violate our plighted word, and to allow our honor to be dragged in the dust, we must stand by Belgium.",m
10688,I saw more than this.,m
10689,I saw that a critical moment had come in the life of our nation and Empire.,m
10690,"For I realized, knowing Germany as I did, that this was not a war to be ""muddled through,"" as had been the case with other wars.",m
10691,"I knew that England must make sacrifices, such as had hitherto been unknown to her.",m
10692,"I knew that before German militarism could be crushed, all the vast resources of our Empire would have to be utilized, and that we must be prepared to spend our last penny, and shed the last drop of our blood.",m
10693,"But even then I did not realize what this war would mean to our Island home, never saw, even from afar, how it would revolutionize the thoughts and feelings of our land, never dreamed how it would affect the lives of the people in this little Cornish village.",m
10694,"XII  FIRST DAYS OF THE WAR   Next morning I took a walk into the village, and just as I was entering it saw a group of youths reading a placard on the wall.",m
10695,"It was headed by the British Coat of Arms, and contained an appeal from Lord Kitchener for five hundred thousand men.",m
10696,The youths looked at it stolidly.,m
10697,They did not seem to think that it affected them.,m
10698,Farther on I saw a woman brushing the little pathway which led to the front door of her cottage.,m

10814,"No one seemed to be stirred to the depths of life, never anywhere was there a deep calling unto the deep; and thus, while the majority of people were respectable and well behaved, they sought for satisfaction in the life around them.",m
10815,"As I walked through the village I came upon a number of miners lounging around, with, apparently, nothing to do.",m
10816,"They were, they informed me, working afternoon ""core"" that week, and thus had their mornings at liberty.",m
10817,"They greeted me heartily as I came up, and willingly entered into conversation with me.",m
10818,"The subject of conversation was the war, and the two things which impressed me were, first of all, that it would soon be over, and, second, that they had nothing to do with it.",m
10819,In the majority of cases they did not seem to feel that Lord Kitchener's appeal was to them at all.,m
10820,"They imagined that soldiers would be forthcoming, and that England would be able to get all the men she wanted, but the idea that they should leave their homes and go away for training did not seem to occur to them.",m
10821,"I am speaking now of those early days of the war, before the terror of it really gripped the country.",m
10822,"""I d'give they Germans about six weeks,"" said one miner to me.",m

10828,"""But you do'ant think they'll bait we, do 'ee, maaster?""",m
10829,"""I think we shall have difficult work to beat them,"" was my reply, ""and the sooner you chaps enlist the better.""",m

10831,"I never fired a gun in my life.""",m
10832,"""Then I think the sooner you begin to learn the better.""",m
10833,But I could make no impression on them.,m
10834,"The war, to them, was a long way off, and they had only a kind of detached interest in it.",m
10835,"They quite agreed with me that, as we were in it, we should have to see it through, only some one else must see it through, not they.",m
10836,The thought of their becoming soldiers seemed utterly alien to them.,m
10837,"I discovered, too, that all of them had a kind of feeling that they would lower themselves in the social grade if they donned the King's uniform.",m
10838,"In the past, the Army had largely been recruited from men of the extreme lower orders.",m
10839,"Of course, I am referring now to privates.",m
10840,"When a young fellow got into trouble, or had disgraced himself in any way, the Army was a kind of harbor of refuge.",m
10841,"Indeed, it was quite common for magistrates to give incipient criminals the choice between joining the Army and being sent to prison.",m
10842,"As a consequence, these Cornish miners, who in their way were exceedingly proud, thought it beneath them to don the King's uniform.",m
10843,"Besides, as Mr. Lethbridge had said on a previous occasion, the whole spirit of the county was utterly alien to anything like militarism.",m
10844,"As, towards noon, I found my way back to my hut, a great feeling of bitterness came into my heart.",m
10845,"""Wouldn't I enlist, if I were able?""",m
10846,I said to myself.,m
10847,"""I would to heaven that I were strong and well, and able to do something; but I am nothing but a useless hulk.",m
10848,"If the spirit shown by these young fellows is the spirit of the country, the Germans will smash us in a few weeks.""",m
10849,For I was not blind to the problem which faced us.,m
10850,I knew that France was not prepared in the same way that Germany was.,m
10851,"I remembered that, forty-five years before, Von Moltke with his perfectly trained army had swept down like an avalanche, and carried away the French army as if by a flood.",m
10852,"I knew, too, that the German forces were far stronger now than they were then, and that, with the thoroughness which characterized them, they had prepared everything to the minutest detail.",m
10853,"I reflected that at that time the German guns were thundering at the Liege forts, and that, except some miracle happened, the German hordes would sweep towards Paris, as in the great _debacle_ of 1870.",m
10854,"I knew we had a little army of, perhaps, 200,000 men, but what could they do against such a mighty host?",m
10855,"I wondered, too, whether our guns were equal to those of the Germans.",m
10856,"Altogether, I was very pessimistic.",m
10857,"After this, some days passed without anything happening.",m
10858,For some reason or other I seemed to be left severely alone.,m

10861,"I went neither to Church nor to Chapel, but hung around my hut, sometimes listlessly walking along the cliffs, but, in the main, staying in my little room.",m
10862,"""I suppose, sir,"" said Simpson, one evening, ""that there is going to be a recruiting meeting in the village schoolroom.""",m
10863,"""How did you find that out, Simpson?""",m
10864,I asked.,m
10865,"""Saw a bill, sir.",m

10872,"I did not ask him any questions, for at that moment Simpson was busily clearing away the dinner utensils.",m
10873,"It was evident, however, that something had excited him greatly.",m

10878,"""Done what?""",m
10879,"""I could not help it, my dear chap. You have seen the placards all over the place.",m
10880,You know the call there has been for men.,m

10893,"I shall have to go to the front immediately.""",m
10894,"""How is that?""",m
10895,I asked.,m
10896,"""What is the use of your going to the front without training?",m

10901,"""But how?""",m
10902,"""Well, you see, for one thing, I know French and German, and for another, I am not a bad hand at mechanics.",m

10904,"""Then you are not going as an ordinary Tommy?""",m
10905,"""In a way I am, and in a way I am not; but there it is.",m
10906,They are going to make a special case of me.,m
10907,"I am off to-morrow to join my regiment, and from what I can hear, the regiment is off in two or three days.",m
10908,"I don't know exactly what my duties will be; but there it is, I am off.""",m
10909,"""What will your father say?""",m
10910,I asked.,m
10911,"""That is what I have come to see you about.",m
10912,I never realized until I had done it what the pater would say.,m
10913,"You know I am fond of him, even although we have never got on well together.",m
10914,"He has never understood me, and I am afraid I have never understood him--there is no link of sympathy between us; but then, you know, he is my pater after all.",m
10915,"Yes, I have joined; but that is not all, Erskine.""",m
10916,"""Not all?""",m
10917,I queried.,m
10918,"""What is there besides?""",m
10919,"""I have been and got married,"" was his reply.",m
10920,"""Got married!""",m
10921,"""Yes.",m
10922,"I expect it was a mad thing to do, but I could not help myself.",m
10923,"You don't know what it is to be in love, Erskine, and I could not bear the idea of leaving Mary without knowing she was my wife.""",m
10924,"""And, of course, your father knows nothing about that either?""",m
10925,"""No, he knows nothing.",m
10926,"You see, I got married by special license.",m
10927,"I was afraid to tell the pater what was in my mind,--afraid he would interfere somehow and stop me,--so I thought I would do it first and tell him afterwards.""",m
10928,Our conversation was not nearly so connected and straightforward as I have described it here.,m
10929,"What he said was uttered in quick, disjointed sentences.",m
10930,"Sometimes he would break off in the middle of what he was saying, and talk about something else.",m
10931,That he was greatly excited was easy to see.,m
10932,"It was evident, too, that his duty towards his father troubled him greatly.",m
10933,"""I don't mind mother,"" he said;",m
10934,"""she will be all right--mother understands me.",m
10935,"Of course, Bella and I laugh at her, and all that sort of thing, because she is always making plans for us, and mapping out our day's program, and telling us what we ought to do.",m
10936,"We call her the general manager; but she is a good sort is mother, and she understands us, too.",m
10937,But the pater is different.,m
10938,"Somehow, he cannot understand us, and we cannot understand him.",m
10939,"I suppose, in a way, he is just, and in many things he is generous to me, but in others----Well, there it is.",m
10940,I wondered what I ought to do.,m
10941,"At first I thought I would go away without telling him anything, but that would be acting like a sneak.",m
10942,"Mind you, Erskine, I would not undo anything I have done.",m
10943,"If ever a man had a call to serve his country, I have, and I think it is a splendid piece of luck that I can be useful at a time like this, without going through the training of an ordinary soldier.",m
10944,"I jumped at the chance of going to the front straight away; but then, there was Mary.",m
10945,How could I leave her without being sure that I had her?,m
10946,I was afraid the pater would take steps to hinder me from ever getting her.,m
10947,You have some idea what he is--and I was afraid.,m
10948,"Besides, she was willing, and so I--I----God forgive me if I have done wrong, Erskine, but I could not help it.""",m
10949,"""Well, what can I do to help you?""",m
10950,I asked.,m
10951,"""There it is, and that is why I have come to-night.",m
10952,I have always had the reputation of having a fair amount of pluck;,m
10953,"I do not fear death a bit, and I haven't a single qualm about going to the front; but it's the pater, you see.""",m
10954,"""What about your father?""",m
10955,I asked.,m
10956,"""I am afraid to tell him, Erskine.",m
10957,"I simply dare not go home and tell him what I have done.""",m
10958,"""Nonsense!""",m
10959,I said;,m
10960,"""he cannot eat you; you have done nothing to be ashamed of.",m
10961,For that matter you have done what thousands of other fellows have done.,m
10962,"You have joined the Army at the call of your King and Country, and it was the right thing to do.",m
10963,"I would to God that I were able to do it too!""",m
10964,"""Would you, Erskine?"" he cried eagerly.",m
10965,"""You think I have done right, then?""",m
10966,"""I think you should have gone to your father first and asked for his consent.",m
10967,"Then, if he would not give it, I think you, being of age, and feeling it your duty, should go in spite of him.""",m
10968,"""But he would not have consented.""",m
10969,"""Exactly; still, you should have asked him.",m
10970,"As for getting married----""  ""Yes, yes, what about that?"" and he looked towards me feverishly.",m
10971,"""Well,"" I said, ""hundreds of fellows are doing it.",m
10972,I have seen scores of such cases in the newspapers.,m
10973,"Hurried marriages have been arranged by young fellows going to the front.""",m
10974,"""Yes, but, you see, they have been different.",m
10975,"They have been married with their father's blessing, and all that sort of thing; but I, I am afraid to go and tell him, Erskine, unless----""  ""Unless what?""",m
10976,I asked.,m
10977,"""The pater thinks no end of you,"" he said excitedly.",m
10978,"""He doesn't say much, but I can see it.",m
10979,"You see, you promised to do well at the Bar, and he thinks you are clever, and all that sort of thing.",m
10980,"Of course he hasn't said much to you, but I know it.""",m
10981,"""Well, what if he does?""",m
10982,I asked.,m
10983,"""Look here, Erskine, that is what I came for.",m
10984,Will you come with me?,m
10985,"If you are with me, I believe I can tell him.",m
10986,"I have got the car outside, and I can run you up in five minutes.""",m
10987,"Although I ought to have seen what was in his mind all the time, his request came almost as a shock to me.",m
10988,Josiah Lethbridge was almost a stranger to me.,m
10989,"It is true I had been to his house twice, and had met him on two other occasions, but he was not a man to whom one could speak freely.",m
10990,At least I thought so.,m
10991,"As I have intimated before, he was a strong, capable man, and, like many of his class, was overbearing, almost repellent.",m
10992,He had risen from a poor lad by his own energy and determination and ability.,m
10993,He had swept difficulties out of his path.,m
10994,He had succeeded because he had made others yield to his stronger will.,m
10995,All these things had left their mark upon him.,m
10996,"He could not bear opposition, and he took it as a personal grievance when others did not fall in with his way of thinking.",m
10997,"I knew, too, his thoughts and desires with regard to his son, knew how he hated militarism, knew how ambitious he was that Hugh, his only son, should take a high place, not only in the county but in the nation.",m
10998,"Therefore, when he was told that Hugh had not only joined the Army as a common soldier, but had married, against his will, a small tenant farmer's daughter, his anger would know no bounds.",m
10999,"Besides, what had it to do with me?",m
11000,"I had known none of them before I came to Cornwall, less than three months before.",m
11001,Why should I be dragged into this imbroglio?,m
11002,"Then I looked at Hugh Lethbridge's face, saw the quiver of his lips, saw the eager look in his eye.",m
11003,"Although I had known him only a few weeks, I had conceived a strong affection for him, and, in spite of myself, could not help sympathizing with him.",m
11004,"""Will you help me?"" he said pleadingly.",m
11005,I nodded.,m
11006,"""You will come with me now and see the pater?""",m
11007,"""If you wish it.""",m
11008,"""Thank you, my dear chap,"" and his voice became husky as he spoke.",m
11009,A few minutes later we stood at the door of Josiah Lethbridge's house.,m
11010,"XIII  FATHER AND SON   I think Isabella Lethbridge must have realized that something out of the ordinary had brought me there that night, for when she met me in the hall there was a look of inquiry on her face.",m
11011,"Still, she greeted me kindly, almost eagerly.",m
11012,"""It is good of you to come up with Hugh.",m
11013,"Father is in the library alone,"" she said, ""and mother and I have sat for more than an hour without speaking.",m
11014,"Come in, will you?""",m
11015,"""I am afraid I can't,"" I said.",m
11016,"""I have come to see Mr. Lethbridge.""",m
11017,"Again she looked at me inquiringly, and I was sure, as her glance passed from myself to Hugh, that she divined something of our purpose.",m
11018,"""You said the pater was in the library, Bella?"" said Hugh.",m
11019,"""Yes,"" was her reply.",m
11020,"""Some man came up to see him directly after dinner, and has only just left.",m
11021,"I fancy he has had some unpleasantness about business.""",m
11022,"Hugh, whose mouth had now become firm and determined, went to the library door and knocked.",m
11023,"""Yes, come in.""",m
11024,"I followed Hugh Lethbridge into the room, while he carefully shut the door.",m
11025,The older man looked at us inquiringly.,m
11026,"""Won't you sit down?"" he said to me, nodding towards a chair; but I could see that he hardly knew what he was saying.",m
11027,"His eyes were riveted on Hugh's face, as if he would read his inmost soul.",m
11028,"Even then I could not help being impressed by the young fellow's behavior, nor, for that matter, by his general appearance.",m
11029,For Hugh Lethbridge was one of the finest specimens of British young manhood I have ever met.,m
11030,"Quite a boy in appearance, he was tall, well knit, and muscular.",m
11031,"He had an open, frank countenance, sparkling blue eyes, and brown, wavy hair.",m
11032,He stood before his father firm and erect.,m
11033,His every movement belied the statement that he was afraid.,m
11034,"There was no suggestion of fear in his presence, except for the fact that once he looked towards me, as if to be certain that I was there, near to him.",m
11035,"Then, without preamble, and without seeking to excuse himself in any way, he burst forth with the news.",m
11036,"""Pater,"" he said, ""I have joined the Army--and--and I have married Mary Treleaven.""",m
11037,The two sentences came like two pistol-shots.,m
11038,He had evidently determined to waste no time or words.,m
11039,His father did not speak a word for some time.,m
11040,"At first he looked at his son, as though he did not comprehend him, and then, when the truth came to him, felt stunned.",m
11041,"I watched his face closely, as Hugh spoke, and for a moment could not help pitying him.",m
11042,"I realized the pride of the man, realized, too, all the plans he had made, and understood something of what he felt when he saw that the structure he had built up was levelled to the ground like a house of cards.",m
11043,At first I thought he was going to lose control over himself.,m
11044,"I saw anger flash from his eyes, saw his face harden.",m
11045,"Perhaps, had I not been there, he would have yielded to the passion of the moment; but he was a proud man, and would not willingly place himself in a ridiculous position.",m
11046,"It was evident, too, that two forces were fighting in his heart.",m
11047,"One was love for his boy; for doubtless, in his way, Hugh was very dear to him.",m
11048,"He was his only son, and, as he had hoped, heir to his possessions.",m
11049,"On the other hand, he could not bear opposition, and would not yield an inch in the pathway which he had chosen to tread.",m
11050,The silence was almost painful.,m
11051,"After Hugh had blurted out his confession, he seemed like one incapable of speech, as his eyes were riveted on his father's face.",m
11052,Neither did he feel that there was anything for him to say.,m
11053,"I had told Hugh, on my way up to the house, that he must not expect me to plead for him.",m
11054,It was not my business to interfere between father and son.,m
11055,"Indeed, I felt like an intruder all through the painful interview.",m
11056,"As for Josiah Lethbridge, he sat in the leather-covered library chair, close by his writing-desk, motionless, for what seemed an interminable time.",m
11057,"Then, as if by force of habit, he took a pen, and began to draw grotesque figures on the blotting-pad.",m
11058,He was evidently thinking deeply.,m
11059,"Outside the night was windless, and no sound reached us save that of the roll of the waves upon a distant beach.",m
11060,"""Dad,"" burst out Hugh at length, ""have you nothing to say?""",m
11061,"The older man moved in his chair slowly, and as if with difficulty.",m
11062,"""What is there to say?"" and his voice was hard and cold.",m
11063,"""Well, I thought that--that----"" And then Hugh broke down.",m
11064,"""What is there to say?"" repeated Josiah Lethbridge in the same cold, even voice.",m
11065,"""You know what my views are, you know what my wishes are.",m
11066,"I have told you more than once my plans about you; but it seems that you thought yourself wiser than I. Or perhaps,"" he added, ""you do not care about my wishes.",m
11067,"That is why you have gone and married a penniless girl who can never be anything but a drag to you--married her, too, senselessly, madly, without a shadow of reason for doing it.""",m
11068,"I saw then that the thing which had wounded him most deeply was not the fact that his son had joined the Army, but that he had married a poor village girl--married her in spite of his wishes, in spite of his positive command.",m
11069,"""You have acted in a very honorable way, too, haven't you?"" he sneered.",m
11070,"""Knowing what my feelings are in the matter, you take the irrevocable step first, and then come and tell me afterwards.""",m
11071,"""But, dad, don't you see?"" and Hugh spoke excitedly.",m
11072,"""Yes, I ought to have spoken to you first, perhaps; but then I knew you would not give your consent, and--and I could not bear to lose her.",m
11073,"You see, I--I love her!""",m
11074,"""Love her!"" and Josiah Lethbridge spoke contemptuously.",m
11075,"""Yes, love her,"" cried the young fellow hotly.",m
11076,"""I have loved her for years.""",m
11077,"""A common village girl!"" burst forth the father.",m
11078,"""She is not common,"" replied the son.",m
11079,"""A purer, better girl never breathed.",m
11080,No one has ever dared to raise a breath against her.,m
11081,"She is well educated, too, and every one respects her.""",m
11082,It was evident the father's contempt aroused the lad's anger.,m
11083,He had no difficulty in speaking now.,m
11084,"Mary Treleaven had to be defended, and he no longer stammered in his speech; words came easily.",m
11085,"""I say she is a pure girl and a good girl,"" he continued almost angrily, ""and I love her.""",m
11086,"I thought for the moment that Josiah Lethbridge would have lost self-control here, and have burst forth in a tirade of abuse; but still he kept command over himself, and, although his lips quivered, he spoke quietly.",m
11087,"""Pardon me if I doubt your love,"" he said.",m
11088,"""May I ask what you intend doing with her?",m
11089,"If a man loves a woman, he should at least have some prospect of keeping her decently before he marries her.""",m
11090,At this Hugh was silent.,m
11091,"The father had, by his question, pierced the weak place in Hugh's armor.",m
11092,"""If you think,"" went on Josiah Lethbridge, ""that I am going to do anything for her, or you, you are mistaken.",m
11093,You have chosen your own way; you must follow it.,m
11094,"I had intended another future for you, but my intentions do not seem to count.",m
11095,"I think there is nothing more to say,"" and he moved in his chair as though the interview were at an end.",m
11096,"Then, as if on second thoughts, he turned to me and said quietly:  ""I do not see why you should have been dragged into this, Mr. Erskine; but I suppose you had your own reason for coming.""",m
11097,"I felt he had placed me in a wrong position, and for a moment was at a loss how to answer him.",m
11098,"Indeed, I felt I had made a mistake in coming, and I was almost sorry I had yielded to Hugh's entreaty.",m
11099,"""He came,"" stammered Hugh, ""because I--I begged him to.",m
11100,"I was a coward, and I--I thought you would b--be more reasonable to me if he came.""",m
11101,"""Have I ever been anything but reasonable to you, Hugh?"" asked the father.",m
11102,"""Of course, to one like yourself, who will not listen to reason, I suppose my words have seemed harsh and arbitrary.",m
11103,"I am an older man than you, and therefore think my way is best.",m
11104,Besides----But we will not speak of that.,m
11105,"Surely, however, Mr. Erskine did not come here with the intention of condoning your action.""",m
11106,"""I am sorry if my presence here is unwelcome,"" I said.",m
11107,"""All the same----""  ""Excuse my interrupting,"" said Josiah Lethbridge.",m
11108,"""Did you know of my son's intention?",m
11109,"Were you aware of his mad plans?""",m
11110,"""No, dad,"" burst in Hugh;",m
11111,"""Erskine knew nothing.",m
11112,"He was as surprised as you when, an hour ago, I went and told him.",m
11113,"The truth is, dad, that you and I have never got on well together.",m
11114,"You seem to have forgotten that you were ever a young man, and had a young man's feelings and thoughts--seem to have forgotten that you were ever in love.",m
11115,"You have always treated me, even since I have reached a man's age, as though I were never to have a will of my own, or to think of disagreeing with you.",m
11116,"I feared you as a child, and--and up to to-night I feared you still.",m
11117,"That was why I asked Mr. Erskine to come with me while I made my confession.""",m
11118,"""Did you think,"" asked Mr. Lethbridge, ""that he would influence me in any way?""",m
11119,"""I don't know what I thought,"" replied Hugh;",m
11120,"""but Erskine told me that you ought to know--that I ought to come and tell you everything; and I have come, and I have told you.""",m
11121,"""Very well.",m
11122,"That is all, I suppose?"" and still the older man spoke in the same calm, measured tones.",m
11123,"""You, I imagine, think you have done a very romantic and heroic thing.",m
11124,"On the other hand, I feel that my only son has disgraced me.""",m
11125,"""Disgraced you?""",m
11126,"""Yes, disgraced me.",m
11127,Every one in the county who knows me will point at me as one whose son married against his father's wishes--married without a penny--married like one who is ashamed of his action.,m
11128,"Well, I imagine I can bear it.""",m
11129,"""Is that all you have to say, dad?""",m
11130,"""I cannot see what there is to say besides.",m
11131,"You have followed your own devices, and you must take the consequences.""",m
11132,"""I think it may be as well to remember, Mr. Lethbridge,"" I said, ""that, whether your son has acted wisely or foolishly, he can claim the credit of being sincere and honest.",m
11133,There is nothing ignoble in a young fellow marrying the girl he loves.,m
11134,"As for his joining the Army, it is what every young man ought to do at a time like this.""",m
11135,"""Pardon me, Mr. Erskine, if I have my own opinions about my son's actions.",m
11136,No doubt the old-fashioned ideas which were instilled into my mind as a boy are regarded as out of date.,m
11137,"I was taught to believe in the Commandment, 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'",m
11138,"That Commandment, in the present generation, is discarded; but I do not think the present generation, or future generations, will be any the better because they have discarded it.",m
11139,"As for his joining the Army, he certainly knows my views about that.""",m
11140,"""But surely you will give him credit for being conscientious and sincere?""",m
11141,Josiah Lethbridge looked down at the blotting-paper upon which he had been tracing grotesque figures without speaking.,m
11142,He seemed to imagine that my question did not call for a reply.,m
11143,"""Hugh tells me that in all probability he will have to go to the front shortly,"" I went on.",m
11144,"""It may be--although I sincerely trust he will come back in safety--he will never come back again.",m
11145,"That being so, it is natural to hope that his father will say a kind word before he goes.",m
11146,"After all, your son is doing the noblest thing of which he is capable: he is offering his life to his country.""",m
11147,"""Pardon me, Mr. Erskine,"" replied Josiah Lethbridge, ""but perhaps I may be forgiven if I hold different views from your own.",m
11148,"I am a plain man, and as a rule do not waste words.",m
11149,"When a son of mine deliberately flouts the deepest convictions of his father's life; when he deliberately defies and does what his father has commanded him not to do; when he tramples underfoot his father's deepest convictions--then, I say, he is no longer a son of mine; henceforth he is a stranger to my house.""",m
11150,I was staggered at this.,m
11151,"I had quite expected anger--denunciation, perhaps--but not this cold, cruel treatment.",m
11152,"""You cannot mean that, sir?""",m
11153,I said.,m
11154,"""I am not in the habit of saying what I do not mean, and I do not speak hastily.",m
11155,"Your presence here, Mr. Erskine, may have given my brave son the courage to speak to his father, although I have my own opinion about your good taste in coming here to support him; but it doesn't alter my opinions and determinations in the slightest degree, and I presume that, since he has chosen to defy me, he has made his own plans for the future.",m
11156,"Anyhow, I have no more to do with him.""",m
11157,"""Dad, you don't mean that!"" and Hugh's voice was hoarse and trembling.",m
11158,"""I do not think I need detain you any longer,"" and Josiah Lethbridge rose from his chair as he spoke.",m
11159,"""I have many things to attend to.""",m
11160,"Perhaps I was foolish, but I could not bear the idea of the young fellow being turned out of his home without making protest.",m
11161,"I knew it was no business of mine, and that I was taking an unpardonable liberty in interfering in any way, but I could not help myself.",m
11162,"""Mr. Lethbridge,"" I said, ""you will live to repent this.",m
11163,"That your son may have been foolish in making a hurried marriage I do not deny; but that he has done wrong in joining the Army at such a time as this I _do_ deny, and it seems to me that no father should treat his son as you are treating yours.",m
11164,"He, at least, is offering his life, while you, without a thought of sacrifice and without care for your country's need, coldly turn him out of the house.""",m
11165,"""Sacrifice!"" and for the first time there was a touch of passion in his voice.",m
11166,"""We are dragged into this ghastly war through the bungling of our statesmen; we are made the puppets and playthings of political hacks!"" he cried.",m
11167,"""The whole country is being dragged to ruin because of the mad bungling of those at the head of affairs, and then, because some of us are sane and do not wish to see the country bled to death, we are told that we are making no sacrifice.",m
11168,Sacrifice!,m
11169,I have within the last week lost a fortune through this madness.,m
11170,My business will be ruined; we shall be all bled white with taxation;,m
11171,"England will never be the same again; and my own son--or he who was my son,"" he added in bitter parenthesis--""offers himself as a legalized murderer!",m
11172,And then you talk about sacrifice!,m
11173,"But remember this,"" he added, looking towards Hugh, ""it will be no use your coming to me in days to come, or expecting help in any way.",m
11174,I wash my hands of your whole future.,m
11175,"As you have made your bed, so you must lie on it.""",m
11176,"Hugh Lethbridge stood in the middle of the room, looking at his father in a dazed kind of way, as though he had failed to comprehend his words.",m
11177,"""You--you surely don't mean that, dad!""",m
11178,"Josiah Lethbridge stood, resting one hand on the back of his chair, his face hard and immovable, no word passing his lips.",m
11179,"""Good-bye, dad,"" and Hugh held out his hand.",m
11180,The father did not seem to notice it.,m
11181,"He stood perfectly still, with the same hard look on his face.",m
11182,"Hugh passed out of the room, leaving me alone with the angry man.",m
11183,"""Good-night, sir,"" I said.",m
11184,"""I am sorry, and some day you will be.""",m
11185,"He hesitated a second, as if in doubt whether to speak, then he looked at me more kindly.",m
11186,"""Mr. Erskine,"" he said, ""doubtless you do not approve of my actions, but my convictions are not of yesterday.""",m
11187,"""I hope, when you have considered, you will act differently,"" was my reply.",m
11188,"""Your son may have all the foolishness of a boy, but he is a lad of whom any father ought to be proud.""",m
11189,"Mr. Lethbridge did not speak a word for some seconds, then he said, half apologetically:  ""I am afraid, Mr. Erskine, that I have been very rude to you.",m
11190,"I remember that you are a guest in my house, and I am afraid that, in my disappointment, I have broken the laws of hospitality.",m
11191,"I shall always be pleased to see you here, when you care to call.""",m
11192,"""Thank you,"" I replied, ""but I am afraid I cannot accept the hospitality which you offer.",m
11193,"The man who closes his door to such a son as yours, and for such a reason, forfeits all right to respect.",m
11194,"I am told you claim to be a religious man, but I will not speak of that.""",m
11195,"And I, too, passed out of the room.",m
11196,I had scarcely closed the door behind me when I saw Isabella Lethbridge standing in the hall.,m
11197,"""Hugh has gone in to see mother,"" she said.",m
11198,"""Please tell me what has happened.""",m
11199,"""I have no right to do that, Miss Lethbridge,"" was my reply.",m
11200,"""Good-night.""",m
11201,"I went to the door and opened it, regardless of what she might think of me.",m
11202,"It seemed to me that I could not breathe in the house; the atmosphere was stifling, and the memory of the look I had seen on Hugh's face made me so angry that I could not trust myself.",m
11203,"XIV  THE RECRUITING MEETING   The human mind and heart are difficult to understand, and, in spite of all men's researches in the realm of psychology, can never be explained.",m
11204,"I had left Mr. Lethbridge's house, angry with the owner of it, almost angry with Hugh, certainly hard and bitter towards Isabella Lethbridge; and yet, no sooner had I got outside than an entire revulsion of feeling and thought came over me.",m
11205,"My mind seemed like a cloud of dust, while confused, whirling thoughts possessed me.",m
11206,"But nothing was real and clear, save that I had played an unworthy part.",m
11207,"I reflected that I had not understood Hugh, neither had I understood his father, and in everything I had bungled.",m
11208,"I had left Mr. Lethbridge when, as it now seemed to me, he was in the humor to be reasoned with.",m
11209,"Had I, I reflected, understood anything of the human heart, I should have known that he would have felt a sense of utter desolation at Hugh's departure, and might, if I had been wise, have repented of his harsh action; but I had not been wise.",m
11210,"In a fit of anger I had refused his hospitality, I had insulted him, and thereby had closed the door of his house against me forever.",m
11211,"With this thought, too, came the realization that I had been anything but courteous to Isabella Lethbridge.",m
11212,"She, naturally, had desired to know something about the interview which had taken place, and I had rudely refused to reply to her question.",m
11213,"I had left the house in a way that was less than civil, and had, as a consequence, stamped myself as a clown.",m
11214,"Strange as it may seem, I had practically forgotten all about Hugh.",m
11215,"I had come to his father's house in order to be near him during the most critical and difficult hour of his life, and I ought to have been with him during the period of anguish which must naturally follow.",m
11216,Instead of which I had left him as though I did not care how he fared.,m
11217,"But more than all this my mind and heart were in a state of turmoil, as I considered my feelings towards Isabella Lethbridge.",m
11218,I had caught the flash of her eyes as she looked into mine.,m
11219,"In my pride and vanity I could not help believing that she had an interest in me which was more than ordinary, and I knew my heart had responded to what I believed existed in hers, even although, all the time, I felt angrily towards her.",m
11220,"I walked towards the Lodge gates, scarcely knowing what I was doing or realizing what had happened, except in a vague, confused way.",m
11221,"At that time I forgot my own malady, forgot that my days were numbered.",m
11222,"It seemed to me that life stretched out before me, full of wonder, and full of promise.",m
11223,"Presently, however, my confused feelings subsided, and I began to think more sanely and connectedly on what had taken place.",m
11224,"I remembered that Hugh's car was outside the house, and that, in all probability, he would be coming along in a few minutes.",m
11225,"I determined, therefore, to wait for him.",m
11226,"So instead of passing through the Lodge gates, I turned and walked back towards the house.",m
11227,I had not gone more than a hundred yards when I met Isabella Lethbridge.,m
11228,"Why she had come I had no idea, because she could not have expected to meet me.",m
11229,"She would, naturally, think I had continued my journey home, yet she showed no surprise at meeting me.",m
11230,"""Mr. Erskine,"" she said, ""what have I done that you should--should----""  I thought I caught a sob in her voice.",m
11231,Certainly she seemed strangely wrought upon.,m
11232,"I was silent, for I did not know how to answer her.",m
11233,"Longings, hopes, fears, and desires surged through my heart in a most unaccountable way.",m
11234,"In one sense I felt strangely happy at being there with her on that bright moonlight night; for the clouds had now rolled away, and the moon sailed serenely in the sky above.",m
11235,"On the other hand, I knew I was much depressed.",m
11236,"While everything was possible, nothing seemed possible.",m
11237,"Truly, life was a maddening maze!",m
11238,"She turned with me, as if to return to the house, and for some time we walked side by side without speaking.",m
11239,"""Won't you tell me what has taken place?"" she asked.",m
11240,"""Your brother has joined the Army,"" I replied.",m
11241,"""He has got married too--married to Mary Treleaven.",m
11242,"He asked me to come with him to the house while he told his father.""",m
11243,"""And----?"" she asked.",m
11244,"""Need I tell you that?"" was my response.",m
11245,"""You mean that my father has driven him out of the house,"" and her voice was hard and angry.",m
11246,"I do not know why it was, but at that moment I felt I must champion Josiah Lethbridge's cause.",m
11247,"The man had angered me beyond words, and yet I found myself excusing him.",m
11248,"""Your father has had all his convictions trampled upon, all his hopes destroyed,"" I replied.",m
11249,"""The things Hugh has done came upon him suddenly, and overcome by disappointment and grief, he--he----""  ""Do you excuse him, Mr. Erskine?"" she interrupted.",m
11250,"""I have neither the right to excuse nor condemn.",m
11251,"I was simply an onlooker, and had no right to be there at all.""",m
11252,She caught my arm convulsively.,m
11253,"""Don't say that,"" she said eagerly.",m
11254,"""You--you have the right; that is, you are interested in Hugh.",m
11255,"He is so fond of you, and he thought, of course he thought, you might influence my father.",m
11256,"Besides----""  ""Besides what?""",m
11257,"I queried, as I saw her hesitate.",m
11258,"""Oh, I don't know.",m
11259,"Everything is in a muddle; everything is so hopeless; and yet father talks about God--talks about the power of religion--talks about providence!""",m
11260,"I was silent at this, for her words were but an echo of my own thoughts.",m
11261,"""Why should not Hugh marry the girl he loves?"" she went on.",m
11262,"""He is young, and has the right to live his own life; if they love each other, what right has my father to stand in their way?""",m
11263,"""I thought you did not believe in love.",m
11264,"I remember, when talking with you about it one day, you expressed the opinion that such a thing did not exist.""",m
11265,"I said this almost triumphantly, as though pleased to get the better of her in an argument.",m
11266,"""At any rate,"" she replied, ""he has the madness of love.",m
11267,"He is willing to give all, sacrifice all, risk all, for it.",m
11268,That is something anyhow.,m
11269,"Mr. Erskine, will you not come back to the house again and plead with my father?",m
11270,He might listen to you.,m
11271,"Do you not think you owe it to Hugh, since you came up with him?""",m
11272,Then her mood altered.,m
11273,"""After all, what is the use of it?",m
11274,Life can never be anything but a promise of something which can never be fulfilled.,m
11275,But I love him for what he has done.,m
11276,I am prouder of my brother than ever.,m
11277,"It is worth living to know that one whom one loves as a brother, has dared everything, and sacrificed everything, for his love.""",m
11278,"A strange feeling possessed me; at that moment I thought I loved Isabella Lethbridge; felt that here, at least, was a woman who, in spite of her contradictions, in spite of the fact that she had repelled me, was worth the love of a lifetime.",m
11279,"As I reflected upon it afterwards, however, I knew that I did not love her.",m
11280,Between my life and hers was a great impassable barrier.,m
11281,"Besides, what right had I, a man with one foot in the grave, a man whose days were numbered, to think of such things?",m
11282,"Again there was a silence between us, and during that silence such a longing filled my life as I had never known before.",m
11283,"I longed to live, to live on and on indefinitely.",m
11284,I hated the barriers by which I was bounded.,m
11285,My whole being revolted against the thought of death.,m
11286,"At that moment, too, I felt as though there must be something for which I could find no better name than God Who was behind all things, Who made all things, Who thought all things.",m
11287,"Why should that Infinity give me life, only to stamp it out, according to His caprice?",m
11288,Why should I be the subject of such a hideous mockery?,m
11289,"With the longing of life, too, came the longing for something even deeper.",m
11290,For the moment my mind was bounded by no barriers.,m
11291,"I saw infinite possibility, possibility which transcended all thought and imagination.",m
11292,"It seemed to me that if man were a child of God, he possessed something of God's life, lived in Him, was part of Him, that he shared in God's Infinity and Eternity.",m
11293,"Then I looked at the woman by my side, and as I did so she seemed to shrivel up.",m
11294,"She was a thing of a day, of an hour.",m
11295,She did not seem to share in this Eternal Life of which I had been thinking.,m
11296,All the time she clutched my arm convulsively.,m
11297,"At that moment I heard footsteps on the drive, and saw Hugh Lethbridge coming towards us.",m
11298,"""Where are you going, Hugh?""",m
11299,I asked.,m
11300,"""Going!"" he cried.",m
11301,"""I am going to the only place a man can go at a time like this.",m
11302,"I am going to my wife.""",m
11303,"""Your father has said nothing more to you?""",m
11304,"""I have not seen him.",m
11305,"He has not come to me, and I could not go to him; but I have seen mother.",m
11306,"She knows, she understands.""",m
11307,"""Are you walking back, then?""",m
11308,"""Walking?""",m
11309,Then he laughed.,m
11310,"""Oh, I see, you are thinking about the car.",m
11311,It is not my car now.,m
11312,"My father has disinherited me, disowned me; this place is no longer my home; but I would do it again, Erskine, I would do it a thousand times.",m
11313,"Good-night, Bella, old girl.",m
11314,"What have you and Erskine been talking about?""",m
11315,"""But I shall see you again, Hugh?"" said Isabella Lethbridge, without seeming to notice the question.",m
11316,"""You will have to come early to-morrow morning, if you do,"" he replied, with a laugh.",m
11317,"""I am under orders now, and must report myself to-morrow afternoon.",m
11318,"Don't worry, old girl.""",m
11319,"""I will make father forgive you, I'll simply make him.""",m
11320,Hugh laughed sceptically.,m
11321,"""You might as well think of moving Routor, or Brown Willie, as think of moving my father; and you know it, Bella; but mother's a trump.",m
11322,"Do you know, mother sees more of this business than I have ever seen.",m
11323,"I told her just now that I was going to the front almost immediately, and I don't think she ever expects to see me alive again; but she behaved like a saint in heaven.",m
11324,"She sees into the heart of this war--sees why England must fight, why it is our duty to crush German militarism; sees why we must save Belgium.",m
11325,"You and I have often laughed, Bella, but her mind, or rather her heart, has probed the thing to its very depths.",m
11326,She has made me believe more in religion during the last few minutes I have been with her than I have believed in all my life.,m
11327,"She quoted some words from the Bible, which opened a new world for me--'Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.'",m
11328,She spoke like one inspired.,m
11329,"I cannot explain the meaning of it, I only know that as she repeated the passage I _felt_ its meaning;--and she made me feel I was doing a great thing.",m
11330,"I was no longer going to the war simply at the call of my country, but at the call of God.",m
11331,"Good-night, Bella, old girl; shall I see you to-morrow?""",m
11332,"""Where can I see you, Hugh?""",m
11333,"""At my wife's home,"" he said proudly.",m
11334,"""Will you dare father's anger, and come?""",m
11335,"Her only reply was to throw her arms round her brother's neck and kiss him, and then, without even looking at me, she rushed rapidly towards the house.",m
11336,"When I reached my little hut that night, I paid the penalty for the excitement through which I had passed.",m
11337,At one time I thought I was going to die.,m
11338,"Pain such as I had never suffered before racked me, and I was as weak as a child.",m
11339,"It was not until morning that the pain subsided, and I was able to sleep.",m
11340,"I, too, had intended to go to John Treleaven's house, and give Hugh a word of cheer as he left to join his regiment; but nature was too strong for me.",m
11341,"I did not awake till after midday, and Simpson had been too wise to interfere with nature's healing balm.",m
11342,"I had expected during the time I was suffering so terribly that it would be many days before I was restored to my ordinary strength, and yet, strange as it may seem, I awoke refreshed.",m
11343,Evidently there was enough vitality in my system to enable me to recuperate quickly.,m
11344,"""There is bad news, sir,"" said Simpson, after I had dressed.",m
11345,"""Bad news!",m
11346,How?,m
11347,"Where?""",m
11348,I asked.,m
11349,"""The Germans are driving us back everywhere, sir, driving the French too.",m
11350,"Do you think the Army would take me, sir, if I offered myself?",m
11351,"I'd like to have a smack at them.""",m
11352,"""How old are you, Simpson?""",m
11353,"""Fifty-five, sir.""",m
11354,"""It may be that they will be obliged to take you before the war is over.""",m
11355,"""I am ready now, sir, if they will have me.""",m
11356,During the afternoon I tried to forget the interview of the previous night in some experiments with the hobby which had occupied my mind for several weeks.,m
11357,"I had become quite efficient in the management of my little wireless apparatus, and I was greatly interested in the little book of codes which the young fellow from M---- had given me.",m
11358,"When evening came I determined, in spite of what I had suffered on the previous night, to find my way to the village schoolroom.",m
11359,"As I have said before, I wanted to feel the pulse of humanity, longed to know what was doing in the world; and living here, in this out-of-the-way corner of the world, it seemed my only chance of fulfilling my desire.",m
11360,"When I arrived, the little schoolroom was nearly full.",m
11361,"There were but few young men, not more than a score in all.",m
11362,The rest of the audience was made up of women and older men.,m
11363,"On the platform was the Squire, who presided over the meeting, and near him were several of the leading people of the district.",m
11364,Both the vicars of St.,m
11365,Issey and St.,m
11366,"Eia were there, together with one or two neighboring squires.",m
11367,"Naturally, Josiah Lethbridge was absent.",m
11368,"I took my seat in a corner of the room, as far out of sight as possible, and tried to understand the little audience which had gathered together.",m
11369,"I suppose every county has its characteristics, and certainly a Cornish audience is different from any I have seen.",m
11370,"Years ago, I had been informed, the people were exceedingly emotional, and easy to be moved.",m
11371,"That, however, was a thing of the past.",m
11372,"There was no suggestion of excitement or enthusiasm, and while each and all seemed to listen carefully to what was being said, it was difficult to tell what their feelings were.",m
11373,"On the whole, I think I never saw a less responsive audience, if one might judge from outward appearances.",m
11374,"A lady with quite a county reputation for singing was at the meeting, and while there are few parts of the country where there is stronger love for music than in Cornwall, she seemed to make little impression on her audience.",m
11375,Yet perhaps I am wrong in saying this.,m
11376,"They appreciated the sweetness of her voice and the melody of her songs, but the sentiment which those songs expressed went for nothing.",m
11377,I have heard audiences spoken of as stolid.,m
11378,The audience at St.,m
11379,Issey was not stolid; it was stony.,m
11380,"The people were keenly alert, they understood all that was being said, and in a way appreciated all the speeches; but they sat coldly critical, and unmoved.",m
11381,Squire Treherne made a model chairman.,m
11382,"He came to them, he said, as a friend and neighbor.",m
11383,"He had known most of them all their lives, and he felt it his duty to point out to them, at this time of national danger, the needs of the times and the duties of the people.",m
11384,"He spoke of what Cornwall had done in the history of the nation; he reminded them of stirring events in the life of the county, when Cornishmen had done their part and more than their part.",m
11385,Then he went on to describe the circumstances which had led to the war.,m
11386,"He described Germany's preparations, told the story of what had taken place in the Balkan States, and related how Sir Edward Grey had done his utmost to avert the war; but the time had come when war could not be averted, and when England had to take her part in it.",m
11387,"Her honor was at stake, her safety was in peril, all that we loved was in danger, and every man in the country was called upon to play his part.",m
11388,"The Squire did not give a brilliant speech, but it was full of good common sense, full of patriotic fervor.",m
11389,The old man did not see how any Englishman could stand aloof at a time like this.,m
11390,"Other speakers followed, who simply repeated what the Squire had said, and presently came the appeal for young men to offer themselves to their King and Country.",m
11391,No one knows how I longed to be able to respond to that appeal.,m
11392,"It seemed to me that, commonplace as the speeches were, no man could, who bore a British name, or had British blood in his veins, keep back.",m
11393,But I could do nothing;,m
11394,I was a useless hulk doomed to die.,m
11395,"I eagerly scanned the faces of the young men who were near me, anxious to catch some suggestion of response to the speakers' appeals, but no one seemed moved.",m
11396,"Each listened attentively to all the arguments that were adduced, but no man made a sign.",m
11397,"Never, as it seemed to me, had I seen a more saddening sight, and presently, when the meeting was about to close, and the audience prepared to depart, I yielded to an overwhelming impulse.",m
11398,"I knew it was madness on my part to do so, but I could not resist it.",m
11399,"After all, what did it matter whether I shortened my days or not?",m
11400,"I could not fight for my country, but perhaps I could persuade others to do so.",m
11401,"As the chairman was on the point of asking the people to rise and sing the national anthem, I got up and asked to be allowed to say a few words.",m
11402,"Of course, consent was immediately given, and I saw some of the people, who were on the point of leaving, resume their seats, as I made my way to the platform.",m
11403,"Indeed, I could not help feeling that there was a wave of more than ordinary interest passing over the audience, as they saw me preparing to address them.",m
11404,I had not the slightest idea of what I wished to say.,m
11405,"Indeed, as I stood up and faced the people, my mind was a perfect blank.",m
11406,"I had simply yielded to an overwhelming impulse, without having any definite message to deliver.",m
11407,Usually making speeches had been no difficulty to me.,m
11408,I had not been a barrister for several years without having had some practice in the art.,m
11409,"Nevertheless, I felt a strange nervousness as I faced these simple country-people.",m
11410,"I had nothing to say, and there seemed no reason why I should be there.",m
11411,"I stood for a few seconds in silence, while the people waited; then, looking in one corner of the hall, I saw Isabella Lethbridge.",m
11412,"She was looking at me intently, her eyes were shining brightly, and her lips were parted, as if with eager anticipation.",m
11413,"Immediately my thoughts took shape, and words came easily.",m
11414,"At that moment, too, a wave of passion passed over me.",m
11415,"I remembered what Hugh Lethbridge had done; knew that even now he had left his wife, left his home, left everything at the call of his country; and as I saw a score of stalwart youths, sitting together in the back part of the room utterly unmoved by all that had passed, a feeling of hot anger filled me.",m
11416,I scarcely knew what I said.,m
11417,"It did not seem to matter; but something seemed to catch fire within me, and in a few moments I realized that the audience had caught fire too.",m
11418,Cheer after cheer burst forth.,m
11419,"Only one thing do I remember saying, and that I thought afterwards was in anything but good taste.",m
11420,"""I have come to you,"" I said, ""as a dying man.",m
11421,"One of the greatest physicians in London has told me that my days are numbered, that I must avoid all excitement, that I must take care that I do not over-exert myself; that if I do, my life hangs on a thread; but I feel I cannot sit still, although this meeting may kill me, while you are unresponsive.""",m
11422,This gave me a kind of text for the appeal I made.,m
11423,"I knew I spoke in hot, passionate words.",m
11424,I forgot everything in my desire to rouse the people to a sense of duty.,m
11425,"I saw that the faces of the people had become set and stern, I noticed that their eyes were shining with a new light, and I felt that influences were at work which had hitherto been absent.",m
11426,"This made me forget the madness of my action, made me careless of my own life.",m
11427,Nothing at that moment seemed to matter but the cause for which I was pleading.,m
11428,"""What are you going to do?""",m
11429,I cried.,m
11430,"""Will you not respond to the call of your King and of your Country?",m
11431,"Will you not fight for liberty, truth, and honor?",m
11432,"As for me....""",m
11433,"Then a great darkness came over me, and I remembered no more.",m
11434,"When I awoke to consciousness, I was sitting in a little anteroom, at the back of the platform, where around me stood the Vicar, the Squire, and two or three others.",m
11435,"""Are you better?""",m
11436,"""I am quite all right,"" I replied.",m
11437,"""What is the matter?""",m
11438,"""You were overcome, exhausted.",m
11439,"I am afraid you ought not to have spoken.""",m
11440,"""Was it in vain, then?""",m
11441,I asked.,m
11442,"""Oh, no; half a dozen young fellows came out at the close of your appeal.",m
11443,"I do not think it was because of what you said so much, but the fact that you were ill, and risked your life in trying to arouse them, which made them feel ashamed.",m
11444,"Are you sure you are better?""",m
11445,"""I am quite all right,"" I repeated.",m
11446,"""I cannot understand how I came to lose consciousness.""",m
11447,"""I am going to run you up in my carriage,"" said the Squire;",m
11448,"""I cannot think of allowing you to walk.""",m
11449,"""There is not the slightest need for that,"" I replied; and as if to prove my words I walked across the room.",m
11450,"""Still, I am going to drive you home,"" said the Squire.",m
11451,"""I am afraid I ought not to have let you speak, even although you have done what we all failed to do.""",m
11452,"As I walked into the schoolroom, a group of people waited, evidently anxious to hear about me, and an old man came up and gripped me by the hand.",m
11453,"""I be glad you be better, maaster,"" he said.",m
11454,"""'Twas good to 'ear ee for sure; you made me think of John Guttridge, when he used to come down 'ere preachin'.",m
11455,"Yes, maaster, you made some of them feel what cowards they was; but we Cornish be curious people.",m
11456,"Besides, maaster, we be'ant used to this sort of thing, and spite of all you say, we ca'ant grip it like.""",m
11457,"""How is that?""",m
11458,I asked.,m
11459,"""For forty year we've bin tould the other thing, maaster.",m
11460,Tha's how it is.,m
11461,"For forty year we've bin tould that war was wrong; and now to be tould it be our duty--well, you see, we ca'ant clunk it.",m
11462,It do'ant seem right.,m
11463,It'll take a lot to git the thought fixed in our minds that the Lord would have us do this.,m
11464,"When you can do that, maaster, there won't be no need for meetin's; the difficulty then will be to keep the boys back.""",m
11465,"Although I did not reply, I felt that the old man had got to the heart of the thing.",m
11466,One could not eradicate the teachings of half a century in a day.,m
11467,"Immediately afterwards, the old man's words were driven from my mind; for coming towards me, with hand outstretched, was Isabella Lethbridge.",m
11468,I saw a look in her eyes that I had never seen before.,m
11469,"""Are you mad, Mr. Erskine?"" she asked.",m
11470,"""I expect so,"" I replied.",m
11471,"""Oh, but I did envy you!"" and her voice quivered.",m
11472,"""It must be glorious to have the power to move people, even though----"" Then she stopped, as if she thought it unwise to utter the thought that had come into her mind.",m
11473,"""Good-night;"" and her voice was like a sob as she went out into the darkness.",m
11474,"XV  HOW THE CHANGE BEGAN   ""That was Lethbridge's daughter, wasn't it?"" asked the Squire, as we drove towards my little house.",m
11475,"""Yes,"" I replied.",m
11476,"""I am surprised that she should be there;"" and I noticed that the Squire's voice seemed tense and angry.",m
11477,"""Surprised!",m
11478,"Why?""",m
11479,"He hesitated a second, then went on.",m
11480,"""I had a row with the man this morning.",m
11481,"I--I could not help it.""",m
11482,"""A row with Mr. Lethbridge?""",m
11483,"""Yes, he made me mad.",m
11484,"I tried to act as generously as I could; but there are limits.""",m
11485,"I was silent, although, truth to tell, I wanted to know what had caused the Squire's anger.",m
11486,"""I went to see him this morning,"" he went on presently.",m
11487,"""You see, I wanted the platform to be as representative as possible, and knowing that Lethbridge is a large employer of labor, and therefore has a great deal of influence among working men, I thought he might be of value to us.",m
11488,"I suppose I ought to have gone to see him before; but the meeting was arranged in a hurry, and--and--anyhow, I didn't.",m
11489,"But I went this morning, and asked him to propose the chief resolution.""",m
11490,"""And what did he say?""",m
11491,"""He refused pointblank, and added an insulting remark to his refusal.""",m
11492,"""And then what?""",m
11493,I asked.,m
11494,"""I am afraid I lost my temper.",m
11495,"You see, I did not understand his point of view--how could I?",m
11496,"Whatever he is, he was born in England, and I am afraid I told him some home truths.",m
11497,"I told him he was a disgrace to his country, that he was unworthy to be called an Englishman, and that I should refuse ever to enter his house again.""",m
11498,"""Pretty drastic,"" I remarked.",m
11499,"""Drastic!"" replied the old man.",m
11500,"""How could I help being drastic?",m
11501,"He abused the Army, abused our statesmen, said we had been dragged into the war by a bungling diplomacy, told me we were as guilty as the Germans were, and that we had torn up more scraps of paper than the Germans had.",m
11502,"I asked him to prove his words, I challenged him to bring forward a single instance where we had treated any country as the Germans had treated Belgium.""",m
11503,"""And he?""",m
11504,I asked.,m
11505,"""He couldn't answer me.""",m
11506,"""Well, what was the upshot of it?""",m
11507,"""After a bit I got rather ashamed of myself for having lost my temper; besides, I thought I might have misunderstood him, and I wanted his help in the fund we are raising.""",m
11508,"""And did he help you?""",m
11509,I felt the old man's body quiver as he sat by my side in the carriage.,m
11510,"""Not a penny, sir, not a penny.",m
11511,"He actually had the cheek to tell me that he had lost a large sum through the war, and that he would be bled to death with taxes.",m
11512,God bless my soul!,m
11513,What have we English people to do talking about taxes at a time like this!,m
11514,"Besides, he is a rich man.",m
11515,"If he lost a hundred thousand pounds to-morrow, he would hardly feel it.",m
11516,"He has been making money hand over fist for a quarter of a century, and now, when the country is in peril, he complains about taxes; squeals like a stoat caught in a gin!",m
11517,"I have no patience!""",m
11518,"""And you got no further than that with him?""",m
11519,"""I got no further with him because I didn't stay.",m
11520,"I have tried to be neighborly with the man, although I hate his views.",m
11521,"But when one's country is at stake, when a man tries to hide his meanness and niggardliness by whining about taxes!--well, you see, we had nothing more to say to each other.",m
11522,"He proved himself to be a bounder, a rank outsider.",m
11523,"I told him so, too.",m
11524,"I said, 'Henceforth, Mr. Lethbridge, we shall be strangers.",m
11525,"I shall never enter your doors again, and naturally you won't want to enter mine.'",m
11526,Then he turned round and asked me what I had sacrificed for the country.,m
11527,"I suppose he thought he was going to make a point against me there, but he didn't get much satisfaction out of it.",m
11528,I told him I had written to Headquarters and offered everything I have.,m
11529,"If they wanted my house for a hospital, they could have it; if they wanted my land for a camping-ground, they could have it.",m
11530,"At that he sneered, and said I was perfectly safe in making such an offer.",m
11531,"Think of it, Erskine, think of it!",m
11532,"What can you do with a man like that?""",m
11533,"""His only son has enlisted,"" I said.",m
11534,"""What, Hugh!",m
11535,"You don't mean it?""",m
11536,"""Yes, I do.",m
11537,"He has enlisted as a private, although I understand that owing to his knowledge of modern languages, and his skill in mechanics, besides being a very good shot, they are going to make a special case of him.",m
11538,"All the same, he enlisted as a private.""",m
11539,"""God bless my soul!",m
11540,"That's good.""",m
11541,"""I am afraid that is why Mr. Lethbridge is so angry,"" I went on.",m
11542,"""You see, he is one of those men who hate war.""",m
11543,"""Hates war!",m
11544,"Well, what of that?",m
11545,We all do.,m
11546,"We English are a peace-loving people, and we detest war, we loathe it, shudder at it.",m
11547,Did I not lose my only son in the Boer War?,m
11548,"But in this case everything is at stake, our plighted word, our honor!",m
11549,"If we slunk out of it, we should be a byword among the nations.",m
11550,"Besides, think what these Germans mean to do.",m
11551,"If they are not crushed we shall have no country, no home.",m
11552,Have you read what they are doing in Belgium?,m
11553,"Have you read about Louvain, Malines, Aerschot?",m
11554,"It is devilish, man, devilish.",m
11555,"They have violated every law, human and divine.",m
11556,I never thought that any fiend from hell could do what they are doing.,m
11557,"And if they can do these things in Belgium, what will they do in England, if they get here?",m
11558,What would become of our women and children?,m
11559,"No, no, it is a call of God, my boy, it is a call of God.",m
11560,"You put it straight to-night, hot and strong.",m
11561,"I nearly lost my head when I heard you.""",m
11562,"""Anyhow, Hugh Lethbridge has joined the Army.",m
11563,"And what has hurt his father even more than that is that he has married that girl Mary Treleaven.""",m
11564,"""God bless my soul!",m
11565,"You don't mean that!"" and the old man lapsed into silence.",m
11566,"""I am glad he did it,"" he went on presently.",m
11567,"""It serves his father right.",m
11568,"And--and Hugh is a fine lad.""",m
11569,"""He _is_ a fine lad,"" I assented.",m
11570,"""But you can understand how his father feels about it.""",m
11571,"""Yes, yes,"" said the Squire.",m
11572,"""All the same, I am glad I gave him a piece of my mind.",m
11573,"I could not help it, Erskine.",m
11574,"I am a peaceful man, and I hate losing my temper, though, God knows, I am a bit given to it.",m
11575,"But I was surprised to see his daughter there to-night,"" he went on, ""and she was carried away by what you said too.",m
11576,"Well, she has good blood on her mother's side.",m
11577,"The Vivians are good people, and the family has owned land in the county for centuries.",m
11578,"Ah, here we are.",m
11579,"I hope you won't suffer for what you have done to-night, my boy.""",m
11580,"""I do not think I shall,"" I replied.",m
11581,"""I dare say I was very foolish, but I could not help it.""",m
11582,"""I am proud of you!"" and the old Squire gripped my hand heartily.",m
11583,"""You have got good English blood in you, you have got the old Cornish feeling.",m
11584,"By the way, I hope you will come over and see me sometimes.",m
11585,"I am a poor man, Erskine, and we shall all of us have to retrench, but you will always find a welcome at my house.""",m
11586,"Then he left me, and I found my way through the copse to my lonely little house.",m
11587,For the next few days I was almost prostrate.,m
11588,I was paying the penalty for my foolishness.,m
11589,"I knew I ought not to have gone to the meeting, and yet, I was glad I had.",m
11590,"So ill did I become that Simpson, without obtaining my permission, sent for the local doctor to come and see me.",m
11591,"This doctor was a tall, gaunt Scotsman, who had, as he informed me, come to Cornwall rather for the purpose of building up his own health than for building up a practice.",m
11592,"I was vexed that Simpson had sent for him, but I could not remain angry with the poor fellow, for I was so ill that he dare not be left alone with me without having some one to advise him.",m
11593,"Dr. Wise was one of the most talkative men I ever met in my life, and after he had asked me a few questions about my illness, he assured me that I had not long to live, and that in all probability what I had done had curtailed the few months which otherwise would have been left to me.",m
11594,"I found out, however, that his chief interest in me was not the malady from which I was suffering, or how he might get me better, but to have me as a listener to his views.",m
11595,"""The country is in a bad way,"" he said.",m
11596,"""We have neither arms nor munitions.",m
11597,"Even now the Woolwich Arsenal is only working two days a week.""",m
11598,"""How do you know?""",m
11599,I asked.,m

11602,"""Has your informant an entree into Woolwich Arsenal?""",m

11607,"""It must be,"" I replied.",m
11608,"""Yes, and then there is all this talk about the Russians coming over to help us; do you know there is a plot in that, a deep-laid plot?"" he asked in serious tones.",m
11609,"""You don't mean it!""",m
11610,"I said, for by this time the man had begun to amuse me.",m

11621,"""That is terrible,"" I replied.",m

11663,"Indeed, as I think of those days, and as I reflect upon my own experiences, I do not so much wonder at the general prevailing sentiment.",m
11664,We are far out of the world down here in Cornwall--St.,m

11666,"That the war existed we knew, that a great struggle was going on hundreds of miles away was common knowledge, but it did not come home to us.",m
11667,The following incidents will give some idea of what I mean.,m
11668,"One day, while walking through the fields towards St.",m
11669,"Issey, I passed a cottage, by the door of which a woman of about forty years of age was sitting.",m

11701,"I could not help laughing at Martha's method for ending the great struggle of the world, neither would I have mentioned it, but to give an idea of the feelings which obtained in certain sections of the country.",m
11702,"But although to many the great carnage of blood which was convulsing Europe was not real, the fact of war brooded over us like a great black cloud.",m
11703,"In a sense we did not realize it, everything was so quiet and peaceful; but in another we did.",m
11704,"It was in the background of all our lives, it colored all our thoughts.",m
11705,"Although I had given up all hope of getting any answers to the questions which troubled me either at Church or Chapel, I still went almost regularly.",m
11706,"I could not understand how, but I had a feeling that it was here I should solve the problems which faced me.",m
11707,"For the first two or three weeks after war was declared there was a slight improvement in the congregations, and then things seemed to settle down to their normal condition again.",m
11708,"And yet there was a difference, a subtle, indefinable difference.",m
11709,"In a way I could not explain, it colored, as I have already said, all our thoughts and feelings.",m
11710,"The services both at the Church and the Chapel were conducted just as they had been, except that some new prayers had been added to the Church liturgy, while the preacher at the Chapel generally made some mention of the war in some part of the service.",m
11711,"It seemed to me, too, that the people were thinking more than usual.",m
11712,"Questions were being asked, which they had never thought of asking when I first came to the village.",m
11713,"They did not go very deep, but they were suggestive of the new forces which were being realized.",m
11714,The change was so slight that a casual observer might not have noticed it; but it was there.,m
11715,"I could not help thinking of the old Biblical story I had read at school, about the cloud the prophet saw which at first was no bigger than a man's hand, but which presently overspread the whole sky.",m
11716,"One day, when I went into the village, a woman stopped me rather angrily.",m

11747,"Indeed, the Navy was far more real to us than the Army.",m
11748,"The Cornish have never been a military people, but have always been at home on the waters.",m
11749,"Many a time, as I have watched those great steel monsters ploughing the Atlantic, I have reflected that they were manned very largely by the Cornish, and that they were the chief bulwark against enemy invasion.",m
11750,"""I wonder if my boy is on her?"" said an old man to me, as one day I watched the smoke from a great warship in the distance.",m
11751,And that question was echoed by thousands of hearts all over the county.,m
11752,"Week after week passed away, until the days became short and the nights grew cold.",m
11753,"Blacker and blacker grew the clouds, while the lists of casualties which daily appeared in the newspapers made us feel that it was no game we were playing, but that we were engaged in a death struggle.",m
11754,"I had not been to Josiah Lethbridge's house, neither had I seen anything of the family, since the night of Hugh's departure, and then--I think it was the beginning of November--I was greatly surprised to see Josiah Lethbridge come to my door.",m

11763,"""I have heard nothing,"" he replied.",m
11764,"""I do not expect to, neither do I wish to.""",m
11765,"I was silent at this, for it was not for me to interfere in his relations with his son, but I could not help feeling angry.",m
11766,"But there was pity in my heart too, for I could not help seeing that the man was suffering.",m
11767,"Why he was suffering I could not tell, but suffering he was.",m
11768,"""You have not been to see us lately,"" he said.",m

11782,"""Of course I have my business, and my public work, but I should be very glad if you would come up to see us sometimes.",m
11783,"If you would let me know when you would come, I'd always send a car for you.""",m

11788,"""I hope you will forgive me for coming so informally, but my wife and I were wondering whether you would come up to-night.",m
11789,Could you?,m
11790,"Of course I will send a car for you.""",m
11791,I reflected a few seconds before replying.,m
11792,"It is true I had told him in a fit of anger that I should refuse his hospitality in future, but I wondered whether he was not repenting of his action towards Hugh; wondered, too, whether by going I could not bring about a better relationship between them and soften his heart.",m
11793,"After all, I owed it to Hugh.",m
11794,"But, if the truth must be confessed, there was another reason which made me long to go.",m
11795,"I knew it was weakness on my part, knew, too, that I was a madman to encourage such feelings.",m
11796,"As I have repeated in this history so many times, with dreary monotony, I had received my death sentence, and as I looked at my face each morning in the glass, and saw it become thinner and thinner, I had no misapprehension about the truth of the doctor's words.",m
11797,Therefore it was worse than madness for me to think about Isabella Lethbridge as I did; and yet--let me repeat it again--I was not in love with her.,m
11798,"""I wish you would come up to-night,"" urged Josiah Lethbridge.",m
11799,"""Ours is a very quiet household.""",m
11800,"""Are you giving a dinner-party or anything of that sort?""",m
11801,I asked.,m
11802,"""Oh no, no. I believe Bella is having one or two friends; but nothing in the shape of a dinner-party.",m
11803,"Come, will you?""",m
11804,"I wanted to accept his invitation more than words can say, and yet something held me back.",m
11805,"""Have you heard anything about your son's wife?""",m
11806,I asked.,m
11807,"Again the old hard look came into his eyes, and he seemed to be struggling with himself.",m
11808,"""I have no son,"" he replied.",m
11809,"""I know nothing about the woman you speak of.""",m
11810,"""Pardon me, Mr. Lethbridge,"" I said, ""but you have.",m
11811,"Your son may not have fallen in with your wishes, but he is your son.",m
11812,Nothing can undo that fact.,m
11813,"As for his so-called disobedience, he acted according to his conscience, and----""  Josiah Lethbridge held up his hand, as if in protest.",m
11814,"""We will not speak of that, if you don't mind,"" he said.",m
11815,"""I do not often alter my mind when it is once made up.""",m
11816,"Again there was a silence, and I was on the point of refusing his invitation, when he, as if anticipating me, broke out almost eagerly.",m

11818,"""My wife is so anxious that you should.",m
11819,She is very fond of you.,m
11820,I never saw her take to a stranger as she has taken to you.,m
11821,"Naturally, too, she is very anxious.""",m
11822,"I tried to read his heart, tried to understand something of the thoughts which were surging through his mind.",m
11823,"""I suppose,"" he went on, ""that you, who know influential people in London, know nothing more of this ghastly business than we do.",m
11824,"That is, you know nothing more than what appears in the papers.""",m
11825,"""No,"" I replied;",m
11826,"""but what has appeared in the papers has surely made us feel proud that we are Englishmen.",m
11827,"You have seen that we have again repulsed the German attack at Ypres?""",m
11828,"""Wholesale murder, I call it!"" and his voice became hard as he spoke.",m
11829,"""But there, we will not talk about that any more.",m
11830,"I shall expect you to-night, then, and will send down the car at a quarter to seven.",m
11831,"No, no, I shall accept no refusal.",m
11832,That is settled.,m
11833,"I dare not face my wife if I had to go back and say you would not come.""",m
11834,And a wintry smile passed over his face.,m

11836,"""Why should I be going to this man's house?",m
11837,Why should I eat of his dinner?,m
11838,Why should I throw myself into the society of this girl?,m

11840,"""I am glad you are going out to-night, sir,"" said Simpson, as he helped me on with my fur-lined coat.",m
11841,"""It must be very lonely for you night after night, sir, with no one to speak to.",m
11842,"I hope you will have a pleasant evening, sir.""",m
11843,"""It must be a little lonely for you too, Simpson, and I am afraid I try your patience sometimes.""",m
11844,"For the man had been with me for so long, and had served in our family for so many years, that I regarded him more as a friend than as a servant.",m
11845,"""No, sir, it is always a pleasure to serve you, sir.""",m
11846,"He lit the lantern and walked ahead of me, as we went along the pathway through the copse.",m
11847,"""Shall I wait up for you, sir?"" he added, as he held open the door of the car.",m
11848,"""I think you may as well, Simpson,"" I said.",m
11849,"""I shall not be late.""",m
11850,"A few minutes later I had reached Josiah Lethbridge's house, and was greeted warmly by Mrs. Lethbridge.",m
11851,"I heard the sound of merry voices in the drawing-room close by, and was made somewhat angry that Mr. Lethbridge had asked me this evening, especially as, in spite of what he had said, they were evidently giving a dinner-party that night.",m
11852,"When I went into the drawing-room, however, I found only three people.",m
11853,"A young man and woman, whom I took to be brother and sister, were the only guests besides myself.",m
11854,"They were the son and daughter of the managing director of one of the Cornish banks, and had motored some twenty miles in order to be present.",m
11855,"The man, Edward Barcroft, was a young fellow of about five-and-twenty, and I knew him to be a rich man's son.",m
11856,There was nothing striking about him.,m
11857,"He was of medium height, somewhat stoutly built, and carried himself with an air of confidence.",m
11858,"I did not like him, however.",m
11859,"He seemed to be too sure of himself, too aggressive.",m
11860,"Miss Barcroft was one of those placid, even-tempered girls who made me think of a German frau.",m
11861,"Before the evening was very far advanced, I could not help concluding that Edward Barcroft was a suitor for Isabella Lethbridge's hand, while, as it seemed to me, she was much flattered by his attentions.",m
11862,I do not think I had ever seen her look so handsome as she looked that night.,m
11863,"I was never able to describe a woman's dress, but I could not help noticing that her clothes fitted her to perfection.",m
11864,They seemed a part of her.,m
11865,"She was very gay, too.",m
11866,"She laughed frequently, but her pleasantries grated upon me.",m
11867,"Why, I could not tell.",m
11868,"She paid me very little attention; indeed, she did not treat me as her guest at all.",m
11869,"I had simply come there at the invitation of her father and mother, while she devoted all her attention to young Barcroft.",m
11870,"I have said that I had never seen Isabella Lethbridge looking so handsome as she did that night; on the other hand, she had never repelled me more, even while she fascinated me.",m
11871,"I understood, as I had not understood before, young Prideaux's description of her.",m
11872,She was a flirt.,m
11873,"I saw that young Barcroft was greatly enamored with her; noted, too, that she laughed at his feeblest jokes, and, as far as I could judge, made him believe that she was as interested in him as he was in her.",m
11874,Yet I could not help realizing the artificiality of her every word and action.,m
11875,"As for poor Hugh, he was never mentioned.",m
11876,"He might never have existed, although I knew by the look on Mrs. Lethbridge's face that she was constantly thinking of him, constantly grieving about what had taken place.",m
11877,"I could not tell why it was, but in spite of the fact that every one except Isabella Lethbridge was very kind and courteous to me, I was angry, and felt a sort of contempt for the self-assertive, unpleasant young Cornishman who made himself so much at home in Josiah Lethbridge's house.",m
11878,"""The war will soon be over, don't you think, Mr. Erskine?"" he said.",m

11950,Why should I care about her evident desire to please this young Cornishman?,m
11951,"And then, realizing that my words were bordering on discourtesy, said:  ""I expect the War Office will have written to his wife.",m
11952,"Anyhow, I will see that she knows to-morrow that her husband is a hero.""",m
11953,"At this, Isabella Lethbridge looked at her father and laughed, while he, having given me an angry look, talked about something else.",m
11954,"The evening, as far as I was concerned, was painful; and yet I was glad I had accepted the invitation, glad I had been there when the news of Hugh's bravery had arrived.",m
11955,"Shortly after ten o'clock I took my leave, vowing to myself as I did so that I would never go there again.",m
11956,"Indeed, as I reflected on what had taken place, I could see no reason for my being asked.",m
11957,"I had nothing in common with Josiah Lethbridge, while, in spite of everything, Isabella Lethbridge was farther removed from me than ever.",m
11958,"""I hope you spent a pleasant evening, sir,"" said Simpson, as he helped me off with my coat.",m
11959,I did not answer him.,m
11960,"Why it was I could not tell, but my mind and heart were full of strange, tumultuous thoughts and feelings.",m
11961,"The next morning, I was on the point of sending Simpson for a carriage to take me over to John Treleaven's farm when Hugh's young wife burst into the room with a radiant smile upon her face.",m
11962,"""Have you seen this, Mr. Erskine?",m
11963,"Have you heard about it?""",m
11964,And she laughed and sobbed at the same time.,m
11965,"""It is about Hugh.",m
11966,"He has got the D.C.M., and they have actually written to me about it, and I have got a letter from Hugh too!",m
11967,"Oh, Mr. Erskine, I am proud and happy!""",m
11968,"""It is splendid,"" I said, ""simply splendid!""",m
11969,"""Did you know about it?"" she asked.",m
11970,"""I only got the letter last night.""",m
11971,"""Yes, I knew,"" I said, before I had time to think of the meaning of my words.",m
11972,"""Has he written to you?",m
11973,"Have you heard from the War Office?""",m
11974,"""No, I have not heard from Hugh for weeks,"" I said, ""neither have I heard from the War Office, but I was up at Trecarrel last night.""",m
11975,"""And have they heard up there?""",m
11976,"""A letter came while we were at dinner.""",m
11977,"""And were they pleased?",m
11978,"Oh, Mr. Erskine, I am so proud and happy, and yet I am miserable too.",m
11979,"You see, I am constantly wondering whether I did right.",m
11980,"I cannot bear to think about it, although I am so happy.""",m
11981,"""Think about what?""",m
11982,I asked.,m
11983,"""About Hugh being disinherited.",m

11985,"""I hope it will all come right in the end, Mrs. Lethbridge,"" I said.",m
11986,"""Oh, but you mustn't call me Mrs. Lethbridge; you must call me Mary.",m
11987,You are Hugh's friend.,m
11988,Do you really think it will all come right?,m
11989,I pray a hundred times a day that it may.,m
11990,"Somehow I think it will, because God has answered my prayer in keeping Hugh in safety.",m
11991,"Oh, Mr. Erskine, I never prayed in my life as I have been praying lately.",m
11992,Somehow I never felt the need of prayer as I do now.,m
11993,"Now that Hugh has gone and left me alone, and while he is in such terrible danger, I am obliged to pray.",m
11994,"God has become more real to me lately; and seeing that He has answered my prayer in keeping Hugh safe, perhaps He will do the other also.",m
11995,"Why, Mr. Erskine, his father cannot keep a hard heart against Hugh when he is such a hero!",m
11996,Have you seen the paper this morning?,m
11997,They have told all about it.,m
11998,"Hugh did wonderful things, simply wonderful!",m
11999,"Oh, he can't help being proud of his son when he reads it, can he?""",m
12000,"I did not reply, because when I remembered the look on Josiah Lethbridge's face I felt I could give her no comfort.",m
12001,"Still, Mary's visit did me good.",m
12002,Her simple trustfulness and her devoted love were such a change from the atmosphere at Trecarrel that her presence seemed like a ray of sunshine on a dark day.,m
12003,"After this, days and weeks passed without anything happening which needs recording.",m
12004,"We had become used to the war, and while we still read our papers anxiously, there was not the great excitement there had been in its early stages.",m
12005,"Our hearts thrilled at the story of the battle of Ypres, especially when, presently, the details of that terrible struggle became known; but the keen excitement and feverish desire to read what had taken place somewhat subsided.",m
12006,"Meanwhile, as all the country knows, the spy fever became prevalent.",m
12007,"On every hand we heard that agents of the German Secret Information Department covered our country like a plague, and even here, in Cornwall, all sorts of stories were afloat concerning people who were suspected of giving information to Germans.",m
12008,"Personally, I paid but little attention to these stories.",m
12009,"I did not see how we, situated as we were, away in the extreme end of the country, could be in any way utilized by the enemy.",m
12010,Neither did I see how any one in Cornwall could render them service.,m
12011,"I was soon to be undeceived in this matter, however.",m
12012,XVII  THE PHANTOM BOATS   It came about in this way.,m
12013,"One morning in the early spring of 1915, it was unusually fine.",m
12014,"For more than a week the weather had been cold and dismal beyond words, then suddenly, as if by magic, the clouds disappeared, the sun shone brightly, and it seemed like summer.",m
12015,"So much effect did the weather have upon my health that no sooner did I finish my breakfast that day than I made my way towards a high point on the cliffs, and having ensconced myself in a sheltered spot, where I caught the warmth of the sun and at the same time had a glorious view of sea and coast, I gave myself up to pure enjoyment.",m
12016,"I felt very happy, I remember.",m
12017,"A letter had come to me from Hugh Lethbridge, telling me he had received a commission, in recognition of services he had rendered, and that he was well, and almost happy.",m
12018,"The winter had about come to an end, and while I certainly was not so strong as when I had come to Cornwall, I did not feel like dying.",m
12019,"The bright sunshine and pure air seemed to give me a new lease of life, and at times I caught myself wondering whether I had not enough vitality in me to overcome the malady from which I was suffering, and which I so much dreaded.",m
12020,I had not been there more than a few minutes when I heard the sound of voices.,m
12021,"A man and woman were talking in the most casual way about the war, and I gathered that something had appeared in that morning's paper which promised well for our arms.",m
12022,"""It is splendid, isn't it?""",m
12023,It was the woman who spoke.,m
12024,"""A number of trenches taken, and the Germans driven back nearly half a mile.""",m
12025,"""It won't be long now,"" said the man.",m
12026,"""We shall soon begin to work in good earnest.",m
12027,"Did not Lord Kitchener say that he did not know when the war would end, but he knew it would really begin in May?",m
12028,"This is only a foretaste of the good news which will come presently.""",m
12029,"""The Germans are such brutes,"" said the woman.",m
12030,"""There doesn't seem to be a shred of honor in the country.""",m
12031,"""They are not sportsmen,"" said the man.",m
12032,"""I was talking to a man the other day who had been to school there, and he told me that no German boy knew the meaning of 'playing the game.'",m
12033,All they have done is a repetition of that which commenced the war.,m
12034,"'It is only a scrap of paper,' said the German Chancellor.",m
12035,"'Of course we signed the treaty, we gave our promise; but necessity knows no law.'",m
12036,That is Germany all over.,m
12037,Could anything be more devilish than to bombard those defenseless towns up north?,m
12038,"As for their treatment of the Belgians--well, it is all a part of their gospel of frightfulness.""",m
12039,"""It fairly makes me feel murderous,"" said the woman.",m
12040,"""I am ashamed of having been friendly with Germans.""",m
12041,"""That is exactly what I feel,"" said the man.",m
12042,"I heard every word they said plainly, although I was hidden from their view; and as everything they said agreed so perfectly with my own feelings, I felt like shouting ""Hear, hear.""",m
12043,"Of course, I said nothing, but remained in the shelter of the great rock, basking in the sun and rejoicing in the soft spring air.",m
12044,A little later both the man and woman came within my view.,m
12045,"Evidently they had not been conscious of my presence, for they started when they saw me.",m
12046,"""Excuse me,"" said the man, ""but the sight of you was so sudden that it almost gave me a shock.",m
12047,"You have discovered a delightful spot.""",m
12048,Then I remembered having seen the man before.,m
12049,"He had come to see me immediately after my arrival, and I had had some little talk with him.",m
12050,"""Have you seen the good news this morning?""",m
12051,Apparently he was in a communicative mood.,m
12052,"""No,"" I replied.",m
12053,"""I never get a paper until hours after other people have read and digested theirs.""",m
12054,"""Ah!"" he said.",m
12055,"""Haven't I seen you before?",m
12056,"Yes, I remember now.",m
12057,"You live at yon little wooden hut, don't you?",m
12058,"I saw you last summer, and your servant was good enough to give me a glass of milk.",m
12059,"Have you not felt it very lonely through the winter?""",m
12060,"""Somewhat,"" I replied, ""but I have got used to it now.",m
12061,"Besides, such a day as this atones for a score of dreary ones.""",m
12062,"""The news this morning is splendid,"" he said.",m
12063,"""My sister and I have just been talking about it.",m
12064,"I think we shall soon have them on their knees now, don't you?""",m
12065,I did not reply.,m
12066,"I was at the moment too much interested in watching the lady, at whom I am afraid I stared rather rudely.",m
12067,"She was, perhaps, my own age, or it might be two or three years my junior.",m
12068,"According to every standard of beauty I know, she was one of the most handsome women I had ever seen.",m
12069,"Magnificently proportioned, simply dressed, a fine carriage, and a brilliant complexion, she would be noticed in any crowd.",m
12070,"I wondered who she was; wondered that even I, living the secluded life I did, had not in some way heard of her.",m
12071,"Her eyes, too, were very striking--large, lustrous, brilliant.",m
12072,"""I don't know,"" I said, turning to the man.",m
12073,"""With such an enemy as Germany, we have all our work cut out.""",m
12074,"""Ah, but surely,"" and he laughed gaily, ""you are not what the papers call a 'dismal Jimmy,' you are not a pessimist.",m
12075,"The Germans are no fighters, they are only boasters.",m
12076,"I admit they are very thorough in their preparations, and there is no doubt about it, they have prepared for this war to the minutest detail; but when it comes to hand-to-hand fighting, they are nowhere.""",m
12077,"""You think so?""",m
12078,I queried.,m
12079,"""I am sure of it,"" said the man.",m
12080,"""I have been in Germany a good deal, and they are blusterers, boasters, cruel if you like, but not brave.",m
12081,"My sister and I were talking about them a few minutes ago, and we both agreed about it.",m
12082,"Of course, they are mean and treacherous, they have no sense of honor.",m
12083,"There are no depths to which they will not sink, in order to gain their own ends.""",m
12084,"""Yes, you have had evidence of that,"" I replied.",m
12085,"""But what angers me more than their treachery, is the treachery of our own people who have given them information.",m
12086,"I saw in yesterday's paper that only English people could have given them signals on the Yorkshire coast whereby they were able to do their baby-killing.""",m
12087,"""Well, we are safe down here, at all events,"" was the man's reply.",m
12088,"""There is nothing for which they need come to Cornwall.""",m
12089,"""I am not so sure,"" replied the woman, and her voice startled me, it was so clear, so musical.",m
12090,"""They seem to have a hundred deep-laid schemes which are apparently innocent, so nobody suspects them.",m
12091,"Even in a district like this there may be spies about.""",m
12092,Both the man and myself laughed merrily.,m
12093,"Looking out over the blue waters, which glistened in the sunlight, we could see three great warships evidently patrolling the coast.",m
12094,"""We have no fear for what they can do here, Rachel, with those steel monsters about,"" laughed the man.",m
12095,"""The Navy has been our salvation, and will be our salvation.""",m
12096,"""I have heard,"" said the woman, ""that Germans know this country to its minutest detail, that there is not a lane, nor a creek, nor a cave along the whole coast from Land's End to John o' Groat's House, but what they are aware of it.""",m
12097,"""Nonsense, Rachel.",m
12098,"I think you are like the rest of the women, carried away by fairy stories.",m
12099,"How long have you been living here, sir?""",m
12100,"""More than nine months,"" I replied.",m
12101,"""The war must have broken out soon after you came?""",m
12102,"""Yes,"" I replied.",m
12103,"""I came in May.""",m
12104,"""My sister is awfully frightened, and is constantly manufacturing schemes whereby the Germans can invade us, and she fancies that every stranger is a German spy.",m
12105,"Have you, living so close to the cliffs for more than three-quarters of a year, ever seen anything of a German spy?""",m
12106,I shook my head.,m
12107,"""Never seen a sign of a German spy, have you?""",m
12108,Again I shook my head.,m
12109,"""There, Rachel,"" laughed the man, ""surely that should quieten your fears.""",m
12110,"A few minutes later they passed on, leaving me alone.",m
12111,"I watched them follow the pathway which led close to my house, then they mounted the hill at the back, and were lost to my sight.",m
12112,That night I went to bed early.,m
12113,"I had exercised myself more than usual during that day, and felt rather tired, yet I could not sleep.",m
12114,"I could not tell why it was, but my mind seemed abnormally active.",m
12115,Perhaps it was because the time allowed me by Dr. Rhomboid was fast drawing to a close.,m
12116,"If he were right, I had not more than three months to live.",m
12117,I got up and lit a candle and looked in the glass.,m
12118,"My cheeks were certainly pale and hollow, my hands and arms painfully thin, and yet I did not feel like a dying man.",m
12119,I remember blowing out the light and putting aside the curtain and looking out on the sea.,m
12120,"There was no moon, but it was a wonderful night of stars, and I could see the long line of breakers as they rolled against the cliffs.",m
12121,"The night was as still as heaven, not a breath of wind stirred.",m
12122,"The very thought of war, of tumult, of the roar of big guns, seemed infinitely removed from me.",m
12123,The night contained the very genius of peace.,m
12124,"I went back to bed again, and still I could not sleep.",m
12125,Hour after hour I lay restless.,m
12126,"Why it was I could not tell, for on the whole I slept well.",m
12127,"I yielded to what seems now a mad impulse, and putting on my clothes, I went out into the night.",m
12128,"Soon my heart beat wildly, for coming round the headline I saw several boats.",m
12129,"They made no noise, and yet, in the light of the stars, I was sure I saw them.",m
12130,"How many there were I could not tell, but there seemed to be many.",m
12131,"Each cleared the corner silently, and then, passing near to the cliffs, was lost to my view.",m
12132,"As I have said, the night was windless, but not a sound could I hear.",m
12133,"No splash of oars, no throb of machinery, and yet, I felt sure I had seen the boats pass.",m
12134,"Of course, I might easily be deceived; for, although it was a night of stars, nothing on the sea showed clearly--the boats were like so many phantoms.",m
12135,"Once, as I crept closer towards the cliff, I thought I heard a rustling noise, but I was not sure.",m
12136,"No matter how still the weather might be, the murmur of the waves was always heard, and my mind, excited as it was, could easily conjure up foolish fancies.",m
12137,"How long I stood there, I do not know.",m
12138,"It might have been an hour, for I was unconscious of time.",m
12139,"Presently I felt myself shiver, then, realizing how foolish I had been, made my way back to my little wooden hut.",m
12140,"I had barely reached my door, when I was certain I heard a rustling in the bushes, just above the spot where a spring of water gushed out.",m
12141,"""It was a hare or a rabbit, or it might be a fox,"" I said to myself, and yet, in the excited state of my mind, I was not satisfied.",m
12142,I had a feeling that something was happening around me.,m
12143,I called to mind the story of Father Abraham.,m
12144,"I remembered, too, the repeated visits of the idiot lad called Fever Lurgy.",m
12145,What had become of him?,m
12146,I had neither seen nor heard anything of him for months now.,m
12147,What lay behind this feverish warning?,m
12148,Why had he told me to leave?,m
12149,"I went back to bed, and in a few minutes was asleep.",m
12150,"When I awoke, it was broad daylight, and hastily dressing myself, I went to the spot in which I had stood the previous night.",m
12151,All was quite calm and peaceful.,m
12152,"The day was wondrous in its glory, even although the sun was yet low in the heavens.",m
12153,"Sea-birds floated overhead, uttering mournful cries.",m
12154,"Out at sea the great steel monsters ploughed their way through deep waters, ever watching our shores.",m
12155,After breakfast I clambered down the rugged footpath towards the beach.,m
12156,I felt a feverish desire to see the cave I had visited on first coming to St.,m
12157,Issey.,m
12158,"The day was like summer; the sea rippled on the yellow sandy beach, and its music to me was like a long song.",m
12159,Everything caused my wild fancies to appear foolish.,m
12160,"I looked carefully on the sand, but there was no sign of a foot-mark, no suggestion of a boat.",m
12161,Presently I found the fissure which led to the cave.,m
12162,"This I entered, thinking as I did so of the quaint brooch of barbaric design which I had found there months before, and which I still possessed.",m
12163,"Lighting a match, I looked at the sandy floor, and my whole body quivered with excitement.",m
12164,"I saw many footmarks, and what seemed to me more important still, a piece of paper which had evidently been used as a wrapper of a bottle.",m
12165,"On it was printed, in German, these words: ""_Bremen's Special Whisky, Manufactured in Dusseldorf_.""",m
12166,"What seemed suspicious was, that any one in Cornwall should be drinking German whisky nine months after the war had commenced.",m
12167,Not even in peace-time had the English people been in the habit of patronizing German whisky distillers.,m
12168,In war-time it was unthinkable.,m
12169,"More than that, I was absolutely certain that this paper did not lie here when I last visited the cave.",m
12170,"Moreover, the footmarks were fresh.",m
12171,They had been made within the last few hours.,m
12172,"I felt as perturbed as Robinson Crusoe was, when, walking on the beach of his lonely island, he had seen a man's footprint on the sand.",m
12173,What did it portend?,m
12174,"I ransacked my brain, but could think of nothing.",m
12175,What could Germans be doing here?,m
12176,What advantage could it be to them?,m
12177,"And yet, what I had seen troubled me.",m
12178,"Leaving the cave, I carefully examined every portion of the cliff, but could discover nothing.",m
12179,No footmarks appeared.,m
12180,No place seemed to exist wherein anything could be hidden.,m
12181,"I spent hours thinking, wondering, watching, all to no avail.",m
12182,When I reached my cottage it was lunch-time.,m
12183,"That afternoon, I remember, the sky became cloudy, and the sea, instead of a wondrous blue, became dark and forbidding.",m
12184,"""I will not go to bed to-night until I feel sleepy,"" I reflected.",m
12185,"""I won't have such a restless time as I had last night.""",m
12186,"I undid the wrapper of a new novel which I had ordered to be sent to me, and prepared to read.",m
12187,Simpson had gone to bed.,m
12188,"The night was chilly, so throwing some fresh lumps of wood on to the fire, and drawing up a chair, I made myself as comfortable as possible.",m
12189,"The book was by one of our younger novelists who, as it appeared to me, struck a new vein.",m
12190,"He possessed what very few novelists have--namely, vision.",m
12191,He looked deeper into the heart of things than any man I had read for some time.,m
12192,"I became so interested that I forgot the lapse of time, until, looking at my watch.",m
12193,I found it was past midnight.,m
12194,I had scarcely noticed this when I heard stealthy footsteps outside.,m
12195,I sat up and listened.,m
12196,A moment later there was a knock at the door--not loud but cautious.,m
12197,"I waited a few seconds, and the knock was repeated.",m
12198,"Standing close to the door I spoke, not loudly, but sufficiently clearly to reach any one who might be outside.",m

12204,"""I mean only your good,"" was the answer.",m
12205,"""That is easily said,"" was my reply.",m
12206,"""As it happens, my man is sleeping only a few yards away, and I have a loaded revolver close beside me.",m
12207,"I am a good shot, too.""",m
12208,I scarcely know why I said this.,m
12209,Perhaps it was because I thought if the man were there on evil intent I might frighten him.,m

12211,"""Who are you?",m
12212,"What is your name?""",m
12213,"""One name is as good as another.",m
12214,"I mean only your good; let me in.""",m
12215,"""Very well,"" I said, ""I will open the door.",m
12216,"If you do not play the game fairly, expect trouble.""",m
12217,"Whereon I opened the door, and saw an old, white-bearded man.",m
12218,"He wore a long ulster and a soft, broad-brimmed hat which partially hid his features.",m
12219,"He came in without invitation, and I shut the door and locked it, putting the key in my pocket.",m
12220,"He looked at me steadily, questioningly.",m
12221,He appeared like a man trying to form an estimate of me.,m
12222,"""Won't you take off your ulster?""",m
12223,I said.,m
12224,"Without a word, he divested himself of the heavy coat, and placing his hat upon it, looked at me steadily again.",m
12225,He might have been Adam in _As You Like It_.,m
12226,"He was doubtless very old, but he was ruddy and hale.",m
12227,"His eyes were bright and piercing, and I noticed that they were largely shaded by heavy white eyebrows.",m
12228,"His hair, also, was thick and white and glossy.",m
12229,"A kindly-looking old man he was, but alert, capable, strong.",m
12230,"""There,"" I said, pointing to a chair.",m
12231,"""Sit down, and tell me what you have to say.""",m

12234,"""Do you speak literally or metaphorically?""",m
12235,"""Maybe both,"" was his reply.",m
12236,"""Anyhow, it hasn't exploded yet,"" was my answer.",m

12238,"""You are very cool.""",m
12239,"""I see no reason to be excited.""",m
12240,"He chuckled, as though he were amused.",m

12243,"""Yes,"" I replied.",m
12244,"""Won't you have one?"" and I pushed him the box.",m

12355,I was startled by the change which came over his face.,m

12371,"Now do you follow me?""",m
12372,"""Yes,"" I replied, ""I follow you, but because you will not tell me plainly what is in your mind, you have aroused my curiosity; more than that, you have aroused the John Bull in me.",m
12373,I am too near death to be intimidated by what you tell me.,m
12374,"As a consequence, you have made me more determined than ever to stay here, unless,"" I added, ""you have decided to come back and live here, and drive me from this little hut, which, in spite of myself, I have come to love.""",m

12448,"I unlocked the door, and he passed out into the darkness.",m
12449,"I listened intently, and heard the rustling of the bushes.",m
12450,"A minute later, there was a murmur of voices, and I knew that Fever Lurgy was near.",m
12451,"After having closed the door and carefully locked it, I sat for a long time thinking.",m
12452,Part of the little success I had had in the law was owing to a remarkably retentive memory.,m
12453,I have sometimes thought that my memory is peculiar to myself.,m
12454,I do not quite know how to describe it.,m
12455,"I have listened to a conversation which has interested me, and I have listened to evidence in court which has been of importance, and for three or four days I have remembered it in its minutest detail, and could repeat it word for word.",m
12456,"At the end of three or four days, however, the details have passed from me completely, although I have retained the broad outlines of what I have heard.",m
12457,"Now as I sat, the conversation which had taken place, every word, every look, every gesture of old Father Abraham was clear before my mind.",m
12458,That the old man was sincere I did not doubt.,m
12459,He evidently believed that I was in danger.,m
12460,"I was sure, too, that he had had some connections with Germany, and that his fears were connected with the war.",m
12461,But I doubted his judgment.,m
12462,I was not sure that he was altogether sane.,m
12463,"He was obsessed with thoughts which had no objective reality, at least so I fancied, and yet his warning was grave.",m
12464,"Not that I intended to heed it: I had not much to hope for in life; but danger or no danger, I meant to get to the bottom of what he had said.",m
12465,Evidently this hut was closely connected with his thoughts.,m
12466,"Evidently, too, it had been under his observation ever since he had left it.",m
12467,"I reflected on all I had said to him, and was pleased that I had told him nothing of what I had discovered.",m
12468,"Remembering all that had taken place in the country during the last few months, I determined to use whatever faculties I might possess in order to discover how I might be a menace to the enemy.",m
12469,"If I could discover that, I should be able to help my own country.",m
12470,"When I awoke the following morning, I realized how truly Father Abraham had read my character.",m
12471,"I could not make up my mind, even although I had tried, to tell any one that the old man was still alive, and that his actions were at least suspicious.",m
12472,"For one thing, I did not believe that he was an enemy to our country; for another, I had my doubts whether any good could result in making a search for him.",m
12473,That he was in hiding in some place in the district I did not doubt.,m
12474,Chigwheal was about nine miles from St.,m
12475,"Issey, and he evidently lived near enough to that village to receive postal communications; but where he lived, or what disguises he might assume, I had not the slightest idea.",m
12476,"That he was a man with a quick brain and of great resource I had no doubt whatever, and I felt sure he would know how to defend himself in case of danger.",m
12477,"In addition to that, too, I felt that I should be acting against the interests which had been born in my heart, if I disclosed his possible whereabouts.",m
12478,"I knew instinctively that he was kindly disposed towards me, and to tell of what had occurred would possibly hinder me from the course of action I had decided upon.",m
12479,Added to all this was a kind of secretiveness which hindered me from making known his visit to me.,m
12480,"As may be imagined, I had plenty of food for thought.",m
12481,It was evident that his interest in me was no new thing.,m
12482,Months had now elapsed since Fever Lurgy had given me the same warning.,m
12483,Doubtless the poor thick-witted lad was but a messenger from this mysterious old man.,m
12484,"I carefully thought over every sentence he had uttered, and weighed their possible meanings.",m
12485,"My danger, if danger there was, lay not in the fact that any one harbored evil thoughts concerning me, but that I lived in this little hut.",m
12486,Evidently the hut itself occupied a position of advantage.,m
12487,It was at the centre of some operation.,m
12488,"The old man had built it for some purpose, and then, for reasons unknown to me, had left it.",m
12489,I called to mind the fact that immediately after my arrival I had seen figures in the near distance who looked as if they might be watching my actions; but why?,m
12490,It was well known that I had no purpose in coming to Cornwall save to find a healthy spot where I might conserve my poor feeble life as long as possible.,m
12491,"One thing, however, Father Abraham had done for me.",m
12492,He had set me on my guard.,m
12493,"I had for some months now taken an intelligent interest in what was going on, and had read the papers carefully.",m
12494,"Like all other British people, too, my eyes had been opened to what militarism had done for Germany, and to the depths of meanness and baseness to which they were prepared to sink, in order to carry out their purposes.",m
12495,"As I have said previously, I had visited Germany on more than one occasion.",m
12496,I also understood the language and could speak it and read it fluently.,m
12497,While in Germany I had talked with professors in the universities and officers in their army.,m
12498,"I was aware, too, of their mastery of detail and of their thorough preparedness for everything they undertook.",m
12499,"What I could not understand was how I, living in this obscure corner of the country, could be in a position of advantage, and how I could be a menace to my country's enemies.",m
12500,"I did not know then, neither did I dream, how my eyes were to be opened.",m
12501,XIX  GOD ANSWERED OUT OF THE WHIRLWIND   Nothing happened for some days.,m
12502,"At first I kept close to the house, and was constantly on the alert lest some evil thing should befall me.",m
12503,I watched vigilantly too.,m
12504,"Remembering all that had been reported in the newspapers, my mind was filled with suspicions concerning the possibility of the enemy pursuing his work in this part of the country.",m
12505,Especially did I watch the cliffs around the little bay; but in no way was I rewarded.,m
12506,"I began to think that I was the victim of a hoax, or that Father Abraham was little better than a madman obsessed with mad fancies.",m
12507,"Thus it came about that after a few days I became careless of the warnings given me, and pursued my old course of life.",m
12508,"At that time, I remember, the black cloud of war hung especially heavy on our land.",m
12509,"The Prime Minister had stated in the House of Commons the number of killed and wounded in our Army and Navy, and the appalling figures which he gave were added to daily by the lists given in the papers.",m
12510,The village of St.,m
12511,Issey had not suffered greatly.,m
12512,"It is true that three men had come home wounded, but their wounds were not serious, and as they had been bright and cheerful during their stay, we had been led to hope that we should escape lightly.",m
12513,"Then, suddenly, the horror of the whole business came home to us.",m
12514,Two of our lads were killed at sea.,m
12515,Then we heard that others had been taken prisoners and lay suffering in a German prison camp.,m
12516,Others still were lying wounded in the hospitals in France.,m
12517,"One morning--it was some days after Father Abraham's visit--I found on opening my newspapers that among the killed was one Edward Trelaske, who died in action.",m
12518,"The name struck me, first because it was Cornish, and second because it was the name of our Vicar.",m
12519,"I saw too that he was a captain in one of the battalions belonging to the D.C.L.I., and I wondered whether he were in any way associated with St.",m
12520,Issey.,m
12521,"Scarcely had I read this than a knock came to the door, and I saw the Vicar enter the room.",m
12522,He looked ten years older than when I had first seen him.,m
12523,"I think I said, when describing our first meeting, that he was a hale and handsome man, ruddy and inclined to stoutness.",m
12524,"Now his face was haggard and bloodless, the flesh hung loosely on his cheeks, and I judged from his eyes that he was a stranger to sleep.",m
12525,Immediately I connected his appearance with what I had just read.,m
12526,"I did not speak a word, I thought it best not to; but I held out my hand, which he gripped almost convulsively.",m
12527,Almost unconsciously I looked at the newspaper.,m
12528,"""Yes,"" he said, ""it is there.""",m
12529,"""It was your son, then?""",m
12530,I said.,m
12531,"""Yes, my eldest son; both were in the Army.",m
12532,"One is still alive, thank God; but Ned, my boy Ned----"" Then for a moment he broke down, his whole body trembling violently.",m
12533,"He recovered himself in a few seconds, however.",m
12534,"""I do not complain,"" he said.",m
12535,"""In a way I am proud.""",m
12536,"""I think I understand,"" was my reply.",m
12537,"""I shall never be the same man again,"" he went on.",m

12796,"Perhaps the thought of Hugh's letter made me think of the latter, for, as I found my way along the footpath, I reflected on our meetings.",m
12797,Why was it that my mind was constantly reverting to her?,m
12798,"I had, in a way, become almost sullenly resigned to the fact that, if Dr. Rhomboid were right, I had only three or four months longer to live, and yet, in a way for which I could not account, I constantly found myself thinking of Isabella Lethbridge.",m

12835,I asked.,m

12862,She looked at me like one startled.,m
12863,"""You have tried to play with my heart,"" I said to her, ""I who am only a dying man.",m
12864,"No, do not deny it, but you have.",m
12865,You have flashed looks of love at me.,m

12867,"There have been times when I have been ready to worship you, but I could not do it, although, as I said, I have loved you--that is, I have loved the woman you ought to be, that you were meant to be; but it was not you.",m
12868,"Do you know, Miss Lethbridge, that you have been a baleful influence in the lives of men?",m
12869,"It does not matter to me now, I am beyond that; but since I have been in Cornwall I have met three fellows whose lives you have blackened.",m
12870,"You won their love, you made them think you cared for them.",m
12871,"Why have you done it?""",m
12872,"Her face from rosy red became ashy pale, but her eyes gleamed with hot anger.",m

12884,I knew I had wounded her deeply.,m
12885,"XX  THE VICAR'S SERMON   On the following Sunday I went to Chapel in the morning, and to the Parish Church in the evening.",m
12886,"As I wended my way thitherwards, I reflected how strange it was that I should make it almost a habit to go to a place of worship on a Sunday.",m
12887,"Prior to coming to Cornwall, I had not been inside a Church of any sort for years; indeed, such a thing was alien to my life.",m
12888,"I had no interest in it, neither did I see its utility.",m
12889,"Indeed, even then I could have given no explanation for my action.",m
12890,Neither Church nor Chapel had given me an answer to things I wanted to know.,m
12891,"As I tried to analyze my reason for going, it seemed that something in the atmosphere of Sunday in Cornwall made it natural.",m
12892,"Besides, it gave a kind of mild interest to my life.",m
12893,"I had but few friends, and living alone as I did, I grew tired of reading and thinking; thus, when Sunday came, the ringing of the Church bells seemed to call me to a house of prayer.",m
12894,"I dare say that if I had been in a country where Mohammedanism or Buddhism was the established faith of the people, I should have gone to their mosques or temples just as I went to Church and Chapel in Cornwall.",m
12895,"To speak quite frankly, I had, up to the present, received no benefit from either.",m
12896,"Mostly the pulpit at the Chapel was occupied by some layman, who spoke in a language different from my own.",m
12897,"These laymen had read no books expressing the thought of the age, neither did they at all understand the attitude of my mind.",m
12898,"That they were simple, earnest men I did not doubt, and yet I often wondered at their daring to occupy the position of religious teachers.",m
12899,"What distressed me, moreover, was the fact that most of them appeared very anxious to convince their congregation that they had prepared a fine discourse, rather than to help people.",m
12900,"The note of deep experience was too often lacking; and yet almost Sunday by Sunday I found my way there, until my presence caused no remark whatever.",m
12901,"In spite of all this, however, I could not help reflecting that since I came to the little village of St.",m
12902,Issey a subtle change had come over the congregation.,m
12903,"Not that the Chapel was very much more largely attended; but there seemed to me to be a spirit of yearning, a deep undertone of feeling among the worshippers.",m
12904,That morning especially did I realize this.,m
12905,"The preacher was John Rosewarn, the father of the boy whose death had been recorded the previous week.",m
12906,I will not try to reproduce his sermon.,m
12907,"Intellectually, John Rosewarn had practically nothing to say to me, and yet my heart was moved strangely.",m
12908,"The shadow of his loss was brooding over him, and although he had no great mental acumen, he seemed to be feeling his way to the heart of things.",m
12909,"There was a deep tenderness in his voice, a new light in his eyes.",m
12910,"He made no mention of his son's death, but the fact was felt throughout the whole Church.",m
12911,"Many wondered, I myself included, how he could have conducted the service that day, yet he did; and although his message from an intellectual standpoint was poor and unconvincing, there was a sense of reality which I had seldom felt in the homely little building.",m
12912,"The congregation felt this too, and especially was it manifest during the singing of the hymns.",m
12913,"One hymn, I remember, the people sang with great fervor.",m
12914,"I had never heard it before, and from the standpoint of poetry it had nothing to recommend it, but as these people sang it, it was weighted with meaning.",m
12915,"""We know, by _faith_ we know     If this vile house of clay,     This tabernacle sink below     In ruinous decay     We have a house above     Not made with mortal hands....""",m
12916,"I saw the tears rolling down the faces of the people as they sang, and I thought I noticed a note of triumph.",m
12917,"When the service was over, John Rosewarn came down from the pulpit into the vestibule and spoke to me.",m
12918,"""Thank you, sir, for calling at our house the other day,"" he said.",m
12919,"""It is a terrible loss, sir, but we shall see our boy again.""",m
12920,I went back to my little house on the cliff thinking deeply.,m
12921,"Yes, a subtle change had come over the little congregation.",m
12922,"The first excitement of the war was over, but something, I could not define what, had created a new atmosphere.",m
12923,"Personally, I was still as much in the dark as ever; and the faith, the suggestion of which I had realized that morning, seemed to rest on utterly insufficient foundations; but I could not deny its existence.",m
12924,In the evening I found my way to the Parish Church.,m
12925,I saw at a glance that a larger congregation than usual had gathered.,m
12926,I noticed that old Squire Treherne was in the great square Treherne pew.,m
12927,"Noticed, too, that Mr. Prideaux, father of young Prideaux, whose name I have mentioned, also several of the larger farmers who seldom came to Church of an evening, were present.",m
12928,"What had drawn them there I could not tell, for it was in no way a special service.",m
12929,"And yet, perhaps, it was special, for I knew that the sympathies of the people were drawn out towards Mr. Trelaske.",m
12930,"The Vicar did not look so haggard as when he had visited me, but the marks of suffering were plainly to be seen on his face.",m
12931,There was no change in the order of the service.,m
12932,"The usual evening prayers were repeated, the Psalms were sung, and the village schoolmaster read the lessons as he was wont to do, and yet here, too, was a suggestion of a change.",m
12933,"A deeper note was struck, a new meaning felt.",m
12934,"I asked myself why it was so, and wondered if the change were in me or in the people around me.",m
12935,The Vicar conducted the service like a man who was very weary.,m
12936,There was no suggestion of triumph or even conviction in his tones.,m
12937,He seemed to be bearing a heavy burden.,m
12938,"When presently the hymn before the sermon was being sung and he left his stall in the choir to go into the pulpit, I wondered what he could say.",m
12939,Had he a message to deliver?,m
12940,"Had his sorrow brought him hope, faith?",m
12941,"He preached the shortest sermon, I think, I ever heard.",m
12942,"Altogether, I imagine it did not take more than five minutes in its delivery, but the people listened as they had never listened before during the time I had been in St.",m
12943,Issey.,m
12944,"He chose for his text a passage from the Psalms: ""The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.""",m
12945,"When he had read the passage, he waited for some seconds as if not knowing what to say.",m
12946,"""Has it struck you, brethren, that during this ghastly war, in spite of the fact that the greater part of the world is under arms, in spite of the fact that hellish deeds are being done, in spite of the welter of blood and the unutterable carnage, that we have heard no one deny the existence of God?",m
12947,"I thought when the war first broke out and assumed such awful proportions, when I realized the misery it was causing, that people would have doubted God, that they would have said, like the enemies of the Psalmist of old, 'Where is now thy God?'",m
12948,"I thought that atheism would have lifted its head again and uttered its desolating cry; that men would have said, 'If there is a God, He would not have allowed these things.'",m
12949,"And yet worse things have happened than we, at the commencement of the war, thought possible, but I have heard no one deny the existence of God, neither have I heard any one seriously doubt His goodness.",m
12950,"Why is it?""",m
12951,He paused a few seconds and seemed to be communing with himself.,m
12952,"""Brethren,"" he went on, ""we meet under the shadow of a great loss.",m
12953,"Some of you, even as I at this moment, feel that we are in the deep waters, and in our heart's agony we cry out to God.",m
12954,"We cannot help it.""",m
12955,"He ceased again, and a silence, such as I have never known before in a Church, pervaded the building.",m
12956,"""Brethren,"" he went on, ""will you pray for me, and I will pray for you?",m
12957,"Pray that we may be led out of darkness into light.""",m
12958,"I thought he was going to finish here, thought he was going to utter the usual formula at the conclusion of a sermon, but he went on.",m
12959,"""God is teaching us many lessons--teaching us how foolish we are, how paltry have been our conceptions of Him; teaching us, too, our need of Him.",m
12960,"Will the Church, will religion ever be the same to us again?",m
12961,"I think not.""",m
12962,"Again he stopped, and the people breathlessly waited, as if wondering what he would say next.",m
12963,To me he seemed like a man in doubt as to whether he ought to utter the words which had come into his mind.,m
12964,"""In the past,"" he went on, ""religion, even in our quiet little village, has seemed as though it were divided into two camps.",m
12965,I have avoided the Chapel people and the Chapel people have avoided the Church.,m
12966,I need not say why.,m
12967,I am sure we shall never settle our differences by arguments or by criticisms.,m
12968,There has been too much of that in the past.,m
12969,"This is a time when we need to pray, and so I am asking all the people in the parish, whether they belong to Chapel or to Church, to meet in the village schoolroom to-morrow night, to pray--to pray that God will bless our soldiers and sailors, and all who are seeking to help us to destroy this awful scourge of war, to pray for broken hearts at home, to pray that God will lead us all into His light.""",m
12970,"He made a long pause here, and we wondered what was to come next.",m
12971,"Then suddenly turning his face, as was his custom, he repeated the formula:  ""And now to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, be all honor, power, and dominion, world without end.",m
12972,"Amen.""",m
12973,The little service was at an end.,m
12974,Quietly we left the old building and found our way into the churchyard.,m
12975,"As I reached the gates, I felt a hand upon my arm and saw Squire Treherne standing by me.",m
12976,"""Will you come up and have a bite of supper, Erskine?"" he said.",m
12977,"""Thank you, Squire, but I dare not.",m
12978,"I ought not to have come out to-night.""",m
12979,"""I am glad you did, anyhow,"" was the Squire's reply.",m
12980,"""My word! this business is giving us a shaking up.",m
12981,"Trelaske has never preached such a sermon before in my hearing.""",m
12982,"I could not help smiling, for in truth he had not preached a sermon at all.",m
12983,"""I see what you mean,"" said the old man.",m
12984,"""For that matter Trelaske never could preach; and, mind you, I have been as bitter against dissent as any man, but--but he has done more for religion to-night than he has done for many a long year.""",m
12985,"""Are you going to the prayer-meeting, Squire?""",m
12986,I asked.,m
12987,"""What, I!",m
12988,"I go to a prayer-meeting!""",m
12989,And he laughed as though it were a joke.,m
12990,"""Yes,"" I said, ""why not?",m
12991,"That is, if--if you believe it has any meaning.""",m
12992,"""Yes,"" he said, ""why not?",m
12993,"After all, why not?",m
12994,"Are you sure you won't come up to supper?""",m
12995,"""Quite sure, thank you.""",m
12996,"I wandered slowly back to my little house, thinking of what the Vicar had said.",m
12997,"Yes, he was quite right.",m
12998,"Never, during the beginning of the war, had I heard any one deny the existence of God.",m
12999,"It might seem as if there were no God at all, when one remembered the deeds that had been done; yet no one seemed to doubt that God lived and reigned.",m
13000,"I had scarcely reached the footpath which led to my little copse when, to my surprise, I saw Mr. Josiah Lethbridge coming towards me.",m
13001,"I judged that he had been to my house, though I did not know why he should do so.",m
13002,"""The evenings are stretching out, Mr. Lethbridge,"" I said, ""aren't they?",m
13003,"It is nearly half-past seven, and the daylight has not yet gone.""",m
13004,"""Yes, the evenings are stretching out,"" he said, with a sigh.",m
13005,"""Have you heard from Hugh lately?""",m
13006,I asked.,m
13007,"""No, I have not heard from him.",m
13008,"I--I do not expect to; you know that.""",m
13009,"""I had a letter from him a few weeks ago,"" I said, as cheerfully as I could.",m
13010,"""He sent me his photograph in his lieutenant's uniform.",m
13011,"Have you seen it?""",m
13012,He shook his head.,m
13013,"""Would you care to?""",m
13014,I asked.,m
13015,"""It is in the house close by.""",m
13016,"""No,"" he said, and his voice was almost harsh.",m
13017,"""No, I do not wish to see it.""",m
13018,"""I have just come from the Parish Church,"" I said.",m
13019,"""The Vicar has received a terrible blow, hasn't he?""",m
13020,"""The Vicar believed in that kind of thing--I never did.""",m
13021,"""No,"" was my answer, ""I do not think the Vicar believed in it any more than you.",m
13022,He regards war only as a ghastly necessity.,m
13023,"But would you, knowing all you know, realizing all our sufferings, and all we shall have to suffer, have had us do differently?""",m
13024,"""You mean----?""",m
13025,"""I mean, would you have the Germans work their will, and dominate the world by material forces?",m
13026,"Would you have had them glorify militarism, and set a war-god upon a pinnacle to worship?",m
13027,"Would you have Europe accept the teaching of Treitschke and Nietzsche as the gospel of the future, while we did nothing?""",m
13028,At this he was silent.,m
13029,"""I was at the Wesleyan Chapel this morning,"" I went on.",m
13030,"""I did not see you there.""",m
13031,"""No, I did not go.""",m
13032,"""John Rosewarn was preaching,"" I went on.",m
13033,"""John has lost his boy Tom.""",m
13034,"He hesitated for a few seconds and I thought he seemed on the point of saying something to me, then he held out his hand.",m
13035,"""Good-night, Mr. Erskine,"" he said, and a few minutes later he was lost to my view.",m
13036,"""That man is deeply troubled,"" I said to myself as he walked away.",m
13037,"""I wonder what he has on his mind.""",m
13038,When I entered my cottage Simpson had not yet returned.,m
13039,"He had asked my permission before I went to Church that night if he might be out a little later than usual, as some old friends of his had asked him to supper.",m
13040,"Of course I gave my consent, but when I found myself alone in the house I felt almost sorry.",m
13041,"What I should have done without him during the hours of the long winter nights I do not know, for although his conversation was not very illuminating, it was always a source of comfort to me to know that he was near.",m
13042,"I sat down to the simple little meal that he had prepared, and then, throwing myself into an armchair, saw the previous day's newspaper lying by my side.",m
13043,"I picked it up almost listlessly, and a few seconds later found myself reading an article on the ravages which were being caused by German submarines.",m
13044,"This article detailed the list of disasters caused by this method of warfare, then asked questions which had been troubling the writer.",m
13045,"This gentleman, who seemed to know what he was writing about, stated that there must be secret stations along the British coast where the Germans could be supplied with fuel, therefore many traitors to their own country must exist in England.",m
13046,"He also insisted that although the shores were constantly watched, hour by hour, and every precaution taken, the Germans had, by some means yet unknown to us, been supplied by people in England with what was essential to their devilish work.",m
13047,"""Has the Government,"" the article concluded, ""been sufficiently stringent in their treatment of enemy aliens?",m
13048,"Has it inquired with sufficient care into the means whereby our enemy has caused such appalling losses?""",m
13049,"I must confess, although everything seemed conjectural, that my interest was aroused, and acting on impulse I opened the door and went out into the night.",m
13050,It had now become very dark.,m
13051,"Clouds hung heavily in the sky, there was no moon and not a star appeared.",m
13052,"The night was not stormy, although a fairly strong breeze was blowing.",m
13053,"The tide, I remember, was high, and the sea swept upon the rocks at the base of the cliff on which my hut was situated.",m
13054,"I peered into the darkness, calling to mind as I did so the night on which I had seen, what seemed to me, phantom boats appearing round the headland and then becoming lost to view.",m
13055,I waited for a few minutes and then found myself shivering with cold.,m
13056,When I got back to the house Simpson had returned.,m
13057,"""Have you heard the news, sir?""",m
13058,"""What news?""",m
13059,I asked.,m

13062,"""Where did this happen?""",m
13063,"""I don't know, sir, but some men in the village had got hold of a Sunday newspaper and were talking about it.",m
13064,"I heard too that two people, one an English woman, and the other a German man, have been taken up as spies.",m
13065,"It seems that they have been supplying the Germans with petrol.""",m
13066,"The man's words seemed almost a commentary on what I had been thinking, and I turned, almost unconsciously, to the newspaper I had been reading.",m
13067,"""The Germans are too clever for us, sir, and there is no dirty trick of which they are not capable.",m
13068,"I am told they jeered at the people who were trying to save themselves from drowning, and even shot at them.",m
13069,"I am not very proud of my county, sir.""",m
13070,"""Not proud of your county!",m
13071,"Why?""",m
13072,"""Why, sir, there are dozens of young fellows in St.",m

13074,"""Off to America!",m
13075,"Why?""",m
13076,"""Why, it seems that the Squire has been at them and told them they are cowards to stay at home at a time like this.",m
13077,"It seems, too, sir, that poor Tom Rosewarn's death, as well as that of the Vicar's son, has roused some of the people terribly, and these young fellows have been called such names that they are ashamed to remain at home, but rather than join the Army, as they ought to do, they are leaving for America.",m
13078,"I have never been a believer in conscription, but the stories have very nearly converted me to that way of thinking.""",m
13079,"When Simpson had gone to bed, I put on a thick overcoat and again went out into the night.",m
13080,"I wondered whether the fancies that had been in my mind had any foundation of truth, and whether I ought not to go to the authorities and make my suspicions known.",m
13081,"There were a great many things against such a course of action, however.",m
13082,"Local officials were not very clever, and did not act with much finesse.",m
13083,"The Germans would be prepared for anything they might do, and if anything were done at all, it must be done dexterously and secretly.",m
13084,"By this time I knew, or at least thought I did, every inch of the cliffs around my home.",m
13085,"I had discovered, too, an opening through the bushes which led far down towards the sea.",m
13086,"Again acting on impulse, I found this little opening, and scrambled down the steep cliff-side until I came, perhaps, within forty feet of the water.",m
13087,"I was entirely hidden from view, as at this part thick brushwood grew to within a few yards of the beach.",m
13088,"Besides, it was very dark, and I knew that if I went farther I should risk my life.",m
13089,"Up above me the wind soughed its way through the little copse, and over the heights of the beetling cliffs which rose darkly beyond.",m
13090,Out at sea I could hear the sad monotone of the waves.,m
13091,"Now and then I heard the cry of a sea-bird, as though it were disturbed in its nest among the rocks.",m
13092,"It was now perhaps eleven o'clock, and every one would, in all probability, be abed, with perhaps the exception of the coast watchers who patrolled the coast.",m
13093,I was on the point of returning to the house when I was startled by the sound of a human voice.,m
13094,"I was at this point sheltered from the wind, and my ears, having become accustomed to the noise of the waves and the night winds, could hear plainly:  ""Is that the lot?""",m
13095,"There was a reply to this, but what it was I could not say.",m
13096,How long I waited I could not say either.,m
13097,That something was taking place that ought not to take place I was sure.,m
13098,Else why should men be in this lonely cove at midnight on a Sunday?,m
13099,"Presently I heard a grating sound, then above the sound of the waves was the splash of oars.",m
13100,"I looked intently, but could see nothing, and by and by when I had returned to my house I reflected that my vigils had been in vain.",m
13101,"Yet not in vain, for I determined, whatever might be the danger accruing from my action, that I would not rest until I had in daylight again examined every inch of the cliffs.",m
13102,"Strange to say, I did not feel much worse for my night vigils, and when I awoke on the following morning my brain was clear and every faculty alert.",m
13103,I was arranging to carry my resolutions of the previous night into effect when Simpson placed the morning paper on the table.,m
13104,The next minute I had forgotten all I had intended to do.,m
13105,"XXI  MISSING--DEAD   On turning to the list of casualties which appeared, I saw to my horror that Hugh Lethbridge was missing.",m
13106,"What that might mean I could not of course tell, but the news made my heart as heavy as lead.",m
13107,During the months I had known him I had become much attracted to the young fellow and had conceived a strong affection for him.,m
13108,If he had been my own brother I do not think I could have felt the news more keenly than I did.,m
13109,"But more than that I reflected upon the sorrow of his young wife, and the pain his mother would be suffering.",m
13110,I called to mind the last letter I had received from him.,m
13111,"""Of course, we live only from hour to hour here,"" he said;",m
13112,"""in fact, only from minute to minute.",m
13113,I have known chaps who have been laughing and joking one minute and have been hurled into eternity the next.,m
13114,That might happen to me.,m
13115,"I am feeling very fit just now, but what may be my fate to-morrow, God only knows.",m
13116,"I do not trouble so much about myself, but it is Mary I am constantly thinking about.",m
13117,"She writes me often, and on the whole is very cheerful, but I know what she is feeling.",m
13118,I do not fear death so much except for her and for mother.,m
13119,"As for father and Bella, I do not think they would care much.",m
13120,"Anyhow, I would rather be killed than taken prisoner.",m
13121,"From what I can hear, those Germans act as devils towards English prisoners.""",m
13122,"I wondered what the term ""missing"" might mean.",m
13123,"Of course, he had been lost sight of, but whether he had been taken prisoner or not was not clear from what the paper said.",m
13124,"""Going out, sir?"" said Simpson, as I put on a light overcoat.",m
13125,"""Yes, Simpson, I am going up to Trecarrel.""",m
13126,"""Any bad news, sir?""",m
13127,"""Yes,"" I replied.",m
13128,"""Mr. Hugh Lethbridge is missing.""",m
13129,"""Dear, dear sir!""",m
13130,"Then lapsing into his old formula when he did not know what to say, he added, ""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
13131,I had scarcely come within sight of Trecarrel when I had an attack of my old malady.,m
13132,It was not severe.,m
13133,"Nevertheless, while it lasted it was terrible.",m
13134,I thought I should have fainted on the footpath on which I walked.,m
13135,"Presently it passed away somewhat, and, undeterred by my suffering, I made my way towards the house.",m
13136,At that moment my last meeting with Isabella Lethbridge had no weight with me whatever.,m
13137,"In fact, I did not anticipate seeing her.",m
13138,"However, she must have seen me as I came up the drive, for it was not a servant but she who opened the door.",m
13139,"""What is the matter?",m
13140,"You are ill!"" she cried.",m
13141,"""I--I never saw you looking like this before.""",m
13142,"""That does not matter,"" was my reply.",m
13143,"""I am all right now.",m
13144,"I came up because--because....""",m
13145,I did not finish the sentence.,m
13146,I was startled by the look in her eyes.,m
13147,I saw her lips quivering.,m
13148,"""Your father and mother are in?""",m
13149,I queried.,m
13150,"""Yes, but--but I do not think you had better see them now.""",m
13151,"""It may not be so bad after all,"" I said, trying to speak cheerfully.",m
13152,"""The paper only reports him missing.""",m
13153,"""Oh, but haven't you heard?",m
13154,"No, of course you can't have.",m
13155,But you ought not to be here.,m
13156,"You look so ill, so terribly ill.""",m
13157,"""She must care for her brother more than I thought.",m
13158,"She speaks like one in terrible distress,"" I reflected.",m
13159,"""Oh, no, I am not ill at all now,"" I said aloud, ""but I saw the paper just now, and I could not help coming.",m
13160,"It is not so bad as it might be, is it?",m
13161,"While there is life there is hope.""",m
13162,"""But there is no hope,"" she said.",m
13163,"""Hugh is dead.""",m
13164,"""Dead!",m
13165,"Why, the paper----""  ""Yes, yes, I know; but we have had a special message.",m
13166,It came late last night.,m
13167,Hugh is dead.,m
13168,"Hugh is killed.""",m
13169,"I stood like one stunned, I could not speak.",m
13170,The news had struck me dumb.,m
13171,"""Can't you say something?"" she cried.",m
13172,"""No, of course you can't.",m
13173,And you ought not to be here either.,m
13174,"I will order a carriage to take you back,"" she added like one distraught.",m
13175,Her words came almost in gasps.,m
13176,"""And your father and mother?""",m
13177,"I asked, without seeming to notice what she had said.",m
13178,"""I hope--I hope----""  ""Mother is wonderful.",m
13179,"You see, she expected nothing else.",m
13180,She always said from the day that Hugh went to the front that he would be killed.,m
13181,"Oh, yes, mother is wonderful, but my father....",m
13182,"Perhaps, after all, he will see you.",m
13183,"Shall I tell him you are here?""",m
13184,"""Perhaps it would be better not, after all,"" was my reply.",m
13185,"""I suppose I ought not to have come here; it was foolish; but I was so overwhelmed with the news that I could not help myself.""",m
13186,"She looked at me for a few seconds in a way that I had never seen her look before, and then left the room suddenly.",m
13187,"Presently I heard heavy footsteps coming towards me, and then Josiah Lethbridge entered the room.",m
13188,"He looked years older than on the previous night, but the same stern strength of the man manifested itself.",m
13189,"He held himself erect, and hid any emotions he might have felt.",m
13190,"""Excuse me for coming, Mr. Lethbridge, but although I had known Hugh for such a short time, I loved him as if he were my own brother.""",m
13191,"""It is very kind of you to come,"" he said almost coldly; and then, ""But you ought not to be here.""",m
13192,"At that moment Mrs. Lethbridge entered, and I could not help being struck by her appearance.",m
13193,There was a new dignity in her every look and movement.,m
13194,"A kind of holy pride shone from her eyes, although it was easy to see that they were not strangers to tears.",m
13195,The suggestion of inconsequence which had struck me when I had first seen her was entirely gone.,m
13196,"""I am pleased to see you,"" she said, holding out her hand.",m
13197,"""You were Hugh's friend.""",m
13198,"""I came to tell you how--how grieved I am.""",m
13199,"""You must not speak like that,"" she said quietly.",m
13200,"""My boy died in a holy cause.",m
13201,"'He saved others, but himself he _would_ not save.'""  ""Yes,"" I said, ""that is true.",m
13202,One cannot think of him as dead in the ordinary way.,m
13203,"When one gives his life willingly for what he believes to be the highest and the holiest, death has lost its sting.""",m
13204,"""Oh, he is not dead!"" she said.",m
13205,"""I could not think of him as dead.",m
13206,The spirit which led him to do what he did can never die.,m
13207,Have you seen what they have said about him?,m
13208,"Here, read his Colonel's letter, will you?""",m
13209,And she passed me a missive which I could see had been stained by many tears.,m
13210,"It was the letter of a plain, blunt soldier who was not gifted with great literary powers, and yet because it was so simple, so straightforward, it was more eloquent than if it had been written by a master of words.",m
13211,"It described how Hugh, in the face of almost certain death, had undertaken work which might mean incalculable advantage to the British Army--that he had led his men forward in the face of withering fire, and that he had done what he set out to do.",m
13212,"At first it was thought that he had been taken prisoner, as no signs of him were to be seen, but presently his body was discovered, almost mutilated out of recognition, yet plainly to be identified by infallible signs.",m
13213,"""He died a hero,"" concluded the plain, blunt soldier, ""died for his country and his God.",m
13214,"Had he lived, I should have recommended him for a captaincy right away, but he has received his promotion in a better world.""",m
13215,"""That is it, don't you see?"" said Mrs. Lethbridge, ""he has received his promotion.""",m
13216,I could not keep back the tears which started to my eyes.,m
13217,"I longed, no one knows how I longed, for the assurance which filled the mother's heart.",m
13218,"Nevertheless, I could not help being gladdened by her faith.",m
13219,"""He will not come to me, but I shall go to him,"" she went on.",m
13220,"""Do you know, Mr. Erskine, a few days ago I began to hope that he would return, and I pictured him coming back to St.",m
13221,Issey well and strong.,m
13222,"I saw the people doing my boy honor; but that was pure fancy on my part, and it does not matter now.",m
13223,"Yes, I shall go to him.""",m
13224,I could not help glancing at Josiah Lethbridge as she spoke.,m
13225,"I wondered what he, who had driven his son from home, felt at that moment; but his face told me nothing; he might not have heard his wife's words.",m
13226,It was hard and stony and emotionless.,m
13227,But he did not rebuke his wife as he would have rebuked her the day before.,m
13228,"He who had forbidden his family to mention Hugh's name sat silent, his face grave, ashen, his eyes fixed on the floor.",m
13229,"What he felt or thought I could not tell, but I could not help believing that he shared his wife's pride.",m
13230,How could it be otherwise?,m
13231,"After all, Hugh was his son.",m
13232,"""Bella told me that you looked terribly ill,"" went on Mrs. Lethbridge.",m
13233,"""Certainly you do look pale, but better than she led me to believe.",m
13234,"May I order you some refreshments?""",m
13235,"""No, I am better now,"" I replied, and glancing towards the mirror, I saw that my face had resumed its normal color.",m
13236,"Scarcely had she spoken than I heard the sound of wheels on the drive outside, and a minute later Squire Treherne was shown into the room.",m
13237,"""I could not help coming,"" said the bluff old man.",m
13238,"""The last time I was here I told you--but never mind what I told you--that is over now.",m
13239,"I just glanced at the paper this morning, and then, before I knew what I was doing, I was on my way here.",m
13240,We must hope for the best!,m
13241,"He is only reported as missing.""",m
13242,But Josiah Lethbridge did not speak a word.,m
13243,"Instead, he looked out of the window as though interested in the trees which were just bursting into life.",m
13244,"""Excuse me, Mrs. Lethbridge,"" went on the Squire, ""I did not notice you; it was very rude of me.""",m
13245,Mrs. Lethbridge did not speak a word.,m
13246,She simply handed him the letter of Hugh's Colonel.,m
13247,"""God bless my soul!",m
13248,"I did not know this,"" he stammered.",m
13249,"""No--no, I did not know this, but--but----""  ""I never felt so proud in all my life,"" said the mother.",m
13250,"""I always knew that my boy was a good boy; now I know that he was a hero.",m
13251,"He laid down his life willingly.""",m
13252,Still Josiah Lethbridge did not speak.,m
13253,His eyes were still fixed on the trees in the park.,m
13254,"""I know what you are feeling,"" said the Squire, after a few seconds of almost painful silence.",m
13255,"""I know, I know.",m
13256,"I lost my only son in the Boer War, and I--I have never been the same man since.",m
13257,"Can--can I do anything for you?"" he added.",m
13258,"""I was just going to suggest,"" I said, ""that I should go over to John Treleaven's farm and see Hugh's wife.",m
13259,"She will, of course, have heard the news.""",m
13260,"""Thank you, Mr. Erskine,"" said Mrs. Lethbridge, ""but that is my work.",m
13261,"It is my duty to go and comfort my son's wife.""",m
13262,Again I noticed the new tone in her voice.,m
13263,The last time I was at the house she would not have dared to suggest such a thing.,m
13264,"She would have feared her husband's anger, but now she stated her intentions naturally.",m
13265,"She did not even look towards Josiah Lethbridge as she spoke, but I, who glanced at him at that moment, saw that his face never moved a muscle.",m
13266,"""If you would do something for me,"" said Mrs. Lethbridge, ""take care of Mr. Erskine.",m
13267,"My daughter told me just now that he was very ill and ought not to have come here.""",m
13268,"""God bless my soul! you do look seedy,"" said the Squire.",m
13269,"""What is the matter?""",m
13270,"""I only had a slight attack of my old trouble, and I look a great deal worse than I am.""",m
13271,"""All the same, I am going to take you back with me,"" said the Squire.",m
13272,"""No, no, I shall take no denial.",m
13273,"That hut of yours on the cliff, with only a man-servant to look after you, is certainly no place for a man who feels seedy.",m
13274,"You--you are sure I can do nothing for you, Mrs. Lethbridge?",m
13275,"I do feel for you, God knows that.",m
13276,"All the same, I do envy you.",m
13277,I wish I had another son to give.,m
13278,"Yes, ten sons;",m
13279,I should be prouder than words can say to send every one of them.,m
13280,"Somehow this terrible business makes one think differently of life, makes one feel that we have had wrong ideas of everything.",m
13281,"Somehow we have confused existing with living.""",m
13282,"Surely that was a morning of happenings, for scarcely had the Squire spoken than a servant entered the room bearing a letter.",m
13283,It came from the Vicar.,m
13284,Josiah Lethbridge took the letter without a word and read it through with the same unmoved countenance.,m
13285,After he had done so he passed it to his wife.,m
13286,"""This is kind of Mr. Trelaske,"" she said.",m
13287,"""He must be burdened by his own sorrow, yet he sends this letter to us.",m
13288,"Of course he does not know all the truth.""",m
13289,I rose to go.,m
13290,I felt that I should be intruding if I stayed longer.,m
13291,"I held out my hand to Mr. Lethbridge, who took it almost mechanically.",m
13292,"""It is very kind of you to call,"" he said.",m
13293,"""And--and take care of yourself; you are not strong, you know.""",m
13294,When I reached the hall I found Isabella Lethbridge standing there.,m
13295,"""That letter from the Colonel is simply splendid,"" I said.",m
13296,"""Of course your loss must be terrible, but you must be proud of your brother.""",m
13297,"She made no reply, neither could I understand the look on her face.",m
13298,"It was not so much sorrow I saw, as wonder and amazement.",m
13299,"""Funny family!"" said the Squire to me, as we drove away.",m
13300,"""Did you notice that the man never spoke a word?""",m
13301,"I nodded, and the Squire went on:  ""My God! what must he be suffering!",m
13302,Drove the boy from home too!,m
13303,"But--but, don't I wish he were my boy!",m
13304,"Anyhow, there is going to be a change in that house.""",m
13305,"""What do you mean?""",m
13306,I asked.,m

13308,Did you notice Mrs. Lethbridge's face?,m
13309,"Did you hear what she said?""",m
13310,When we reached St.,m

13312,"""No, no, Erskine,"" he said, ""you must come up and spend the day with me;",m
13313,I have nothing to do.,m
13314,"Do you know, I have often felt condemned at leaving you so much alone; but you seemed as though you did not wish for society.",m
13315,"Still, I have got you now!",m
13316,"Yes, yes, I will send word to that man of yours, telling him what has happened to you.""",m
13317,"A few minutes later I was snugly ensconced in the Squire's library, while Mrs. Treherne and her daughter fussed about me as though I were an invalid.",m
13318,I must confess that it was pleasant to be ministered to by a woman's hands.,m
13319,"Simpson was all very well, but I do not think that any man knows what to do in the time of illness as a woman does.",m
13320,"""What are you thinking about, Erskine?"" asked the Squire presently, after he had placed a box of cigars before me.",m
13321,"""I was thinking about Mr. Lethbridge's face,"" I said.",m
13322,"""I was wondering what he must be feeling.""",m
13323,"""A hard man, Erskine, a hard man.",m

13325,"Whatever he has touched has turned to gold, whatever he has willed has come to pass.""",m
13326,The Squire sighed as he spoke.,m
13327,"""He has pulled all sorts of people into his net,"" he went on, ""and got all sorts of people into his power.",m
13328,"He does not say much, but he could ruin lots of us if he willed so to do.""",m
13329,"I called to mind what Hugh Lethbridge had told me, and I fancy I knew what the old man was thinking.",m
13330,"""Sometimes, deep down in my heart,"" went on the Squire, ""I have called him a Shylock; but I am not going to think about that now.",m
13331,"He is passing through deep waters.""",m
13332,"After lunch, I again announced my intention of returning home, but was again dissuaded; not only the Squire, but neither his wife nor his daughter would hear of my going.",m
13333,"""We will have an informal dinner at six o'clock,"" said the old man, ""then you must come with me to the prayer-meeting.""",m
13334,The idea seemed so incongruous that I could not help smiling.,m
13335,"""Yes, I know what you are thinking,"" said the Squire, with a laugh.",m
13336,"""I have never been to a prayer-meeting in my life, and I had no thought of going until you kind of suggested it to me yourself after last night's service; but when I came to think about it, it seemed natural and right.",m

13338,I never realized it as I do now.,m

13344,We do not realize yet how strong they are.,m
13345,"They have utilized all the resources of their country to beat us, to crush us, and we shall have to use every ounce of strength we possess to come out on top.",m

13347,"""But that is not all, Erskine.",m
13348,"I know I have not been a religious man in the ordinary sense of the word, although I have gone to Church and tried to act straight, but it seems to me as though God wants to teach us a lesson.",m
13349,He is wanting to bring us to our senses.,m
13350,"Never in my life have I realized the need of God as I do now, and if we are to fight His battles we need to go to Him for help.",m

13357,"At seven o'clock that night the Squire and I stood at the door of the village schoolroom, for we had both determined to go to the prayer-meeting.",m
13358,XXII  A DISCOVERY   I must confess that it was with a strange feeling that I took my seat in the little village schoolroom that night.,m
13359,"I had been born and educated in a Christian country, and yet I had never been to a prayer-meeting in my life.",m
13360,"As I have previously said, until I came to St.",m

13362,"I was startled to find, on looking round the room, that not only Mrs. Lethbridge and Isabella, but also Josiah Lethbridge had come.",m
13363,Their faces formed a curious contrast.,m
13364,"Mrs. Lethbridge looked proud, almost triumphant, in spite of the marks of the sorrow which were plainly to be seen on her face.",m
13365,"I noticed, too, that after the meeting commenced she entered heartily into the singing of the hymns.",m
13366,"Her daughter's face, on the other hand, was not easy to describe.",m
13367,"In one sense she looked callous, bored, indifferent; in another, there was an expression of amazement, bewilderment, which I could not explain.",m
13368,But she made no sign of any sort.,m
13369,"She sang none of the hymns, neither did she bow her head during prayer.",m
13370,"As for Josiah Lethbridge, his face remained stern and immovable during the whole of the meeting.",m

13372,"Years before, I was told, Josiah Lethbridge used to pray in the prayer-meetings at the Wesleyan Chapel; but he had ceased doing so for a long time, although he had never severed his connection with the Church and had rigidly maintained his observance of the outward form of religion.",m
13373,"More than once I wondered why he was there, for he must have seen the curious eyes that were cast upon him.",m
13374,Of course every one had heard of Hugh Lethbridge's death.,m
13375,"Every one knew, too, that the father had driven his son from home because he had joined the Army, and because he had married the girl he loved.",m
13376,"Besides all this, it was common talk that John Treleaven's daughter Mary had never been bidden to the great house at Trecarrel.",m
13377,"The gossips had talked about it freely, and many remarks, not complimentary to Hugh's father, had passed.",m
13378,"Still he was there, his face as stern as ever, his eyes keenly alert to all that took place.",m
13379,"Just before the meeting commenced we were somewhat surprised to see not only the Vicar, but the Wesleyan minister ascend the platform together.",m
13380,The Vicar explained this circumstance at the commencement of the proceedings.,m
13381,"He repeated what he had said the previous night, and described how the Church and the Chapel had for years been regarded as opposing camps.",m
13382,"""My dear friends,"" said the Vicar quietly, ""I have been a Churchman all my life, and shall remain one until my death; but the troubles through which we are passing have taught me to see many things.",m
13383,"I suppose we shall never see eye to eye, but we are all believers in the same God and in the same Saviour.",m
13384,"More than that, we are all English people.",m
13385,"Lads from the Church are fighting at the front, side by side with the lads from the Chapel.",m

13398,I will not try to reproduce his prayer.,m
13399,"It was very unconventional, and yet the fact of this man taking part in such a meeting was significant of much.",m
13400,"I noticed, too, that the Squire was as nervous as a child.",m
13401,"When the meeting was over, Mr. Treherne took hold of my arm.",m
13402,"""Wait for me, will you, Erskine?",m
13403,"I want to speak to Trelaske a minute, and then I am going to drive you up to your place.""",m
13404,"The room was nearly empty at this time, and no one but myself saw Isabella Lethbridge come towards me.",m
13405,"""Mr. Erskine, you do not understand, and because you do not understand you are hard and unsympathetic,"" she said.",m
13406,"She gave me no chance of replying, and I was left wondering as to the meaning of her words.",m
13407,The next morning the newspapers were again full of accounts of the work of the German submarines.,m
13408,"Three trading vessels had been sunk, and many lives lost.",m
13409,"This reminded me of the determination to which I had come on the previous Sunday night, and directly after breakfast I made preparations for carrying out my plans.",m
13410,"If there was any truth in old Father Abraham's warnings, however, it was necessary for me to be careful, so I made a point of reconnoitring the coast before taking any definite action.",m
13411,"I dressed myself as if for walking, and arming myself with a walking stick, and putting the revolver, which Simpson had persuaded me to carry, in my hip pocket, I went to the highest point of the cliff.",m
13412,"It was one of those dull days when a thick mist enveloped everything, and although this mist, unlike a London fog, did not entirely hide the view, it shut out everything except what lay in the near distance.",m
13413,I had scarcely reached the summit of the headland when I heard a cry of pain.,m
13414,"With some difficulty I located it, and after investigation discovered a poor little mongrel dog, lying wounded.",m
13415,"The creature looked piteously up at me as I approached, as if to solicit my aid.",m
13416,"On examining it more closely I found that it had received what seemed like a wound from a pistol or a rifle, but of this I was not sure.",m
13417,"I did not think it was mortally wounded, although it bled freely.",m
13418,"I had never seen the dog before, nor could I imagine who could be its master.",m
13419,"""Poor little chap,"" I said, as I patted its head.",m
13420,"It gave a slight yelp, as if in recognition of my act of kindness.",m
13421,"""Simpson has always been wanting me to keep a dog,"" I reflected.",m
13422,"""I wonder if this little thing would live if I took it home and cared for it?""",m
13423,"For a moment the incident, slight as it was, drove from my mind the purpose I had in view.",m
13424,I was preparing to carry it back when I heard the sound of voices.,m
13425,Immediately the dog gave a cry of fear and pain.,m
13426,Perhaps it shrank from my endeavors to carry it.,m
13427,"I placed it upon the ground, reflecting that I would return to the house and obtain Simpson's assistance, but at that moment a man and a woman came within my view.",m
13428,"I remembered in a moment that they were the people who had spoken to me, as I sat basking in the sunlight, a few days before.",m
13429,"""Ah, what have you there?"" said the man.",m
13430,"""I have only just found it,"" I replied.",m
13431,"""I came out for a walk, and heard the poor little thing moaning.""",m
13432,"""The little wretch has been poaching, I expect, and somebody's gamekeeper has shot it.""",m
13433,"""I should not think that likely,"" was my reply.",m
13434,"""This is common land here, and no one, as far as I know, has attempted to preserve it.",m
13435,"The only man who owns a gamekeeper in the immediate district is Squire Treherne, and his woods are at least two miles away.""",m
13436,"The man looked at the dog, as I thought, indifferently, while the woman shuddered at the sight of blood.",m
13437,"""Have you any idea whose it is?"" he asked.",m
13438,"""Not the slightest,"" I replied.",m
13439,"""I should let him stay, if I were you,"" said the man.",m
13440,"""He is an ugly-looking beast, and I should judge that his teeth are poisonous.",m
13441,"There is no trusting that kind of dog, they will bite even those who try to help them.""",m
13442,All this time the poor little thing was whining and whimpering piteously.,m
13443,"""I shall take it back to the house,"" I said.",m
13444,"""I am afraid it is badly wounded, but I should like to save its life if I could.""",m
13445,"""Even if you do, you will never win a prize at the shows,"" said the man, with a laugh.",m
13446,"""I hate those mongrel dogs.",m
13447,"By the way,"" he went on, ""is not this a bad morning for you to be out?",m
13448,"You look very ill, and have the appearance of a man who ought to be in bed.""",m
13449,To this I made no reply.,m
13450,"To say the least of it, I regarded it as an impertinence for the man to make any remark at all on my appearance.",m
13451,"I knew nothing of him, and beyond the occasions I have mentioned I had never met him.",m
13452,"""You are a hard-hearted brute,"" said the lady, speaking to her brother.",m
13453,"""I think it awfully kind of you, sir, to take so much interest in the poor little thing.""",m
13454,"""Excuse me for asking,"" said the man, ""but since I have met you I have often wondered at you living alone at that little hut.""",m
13455,His manner appeared to invite confidence.,m
13456,"""I expect I am somewhat of a hermit,"" I replied.",m
13457,"""But whatever induced you to live in such a place?",m
13458,"Are you not afraid of tramps and that sort of thing?"" and he nodded towards my little house.",m
13459,"""Tramps!""",m
13460,I replied.,m
13461,"""I have not seen a tramp since I have been in Cornwall.""",m
13462,"""Well, different people, different tastes!"" and he laughed as he spoke.",m
13463,"""But if I were you I should not live in such a lonely spot as that for whatever might be given me.",m
13464,"Even in Cornwall it is possible to dispose of people, and you would be fair prey to any strolling vagabond.""",m
13465,"""He might be wanting to frighten me,"" I said to myself.",m
13466,"""I wonder what his purpose is?"" and I could not help connecting him with old Father Abraham.",m
13467,"""Rather bad news of the war again,"" he went on, as if desiring to change the subject.",m
13468,"""As to that,"" I replied, ""I thought it was rather good news, except for what the German submarines are doing.""",m
13469,"""Yes, yes, the submarines, they are very bad.""",m
13470,"""What brutes the Germans are,"" chimed in the woman.",m
13471,"""They make me feel just murderous.",m
13472,"Oh, I wish I were a man that I might join the Army.""",m
13473,All the time the poor little creature was whimpering as if in pain.,m
13474,"""Let me throw it over the cliff,"" said the man, ""and put it out of its misery.""",m
13475,"""No,"" I replied, ""I am going to take it back to the house.""",m
13476,"""Yes, yes, do,"" said the woman.",m
13477,"""May I help you?",m
13478,I am awfully fond of dogs.,m
13479,I have kept them all my life and know a good deal about them.,m
13480,"I have saved two that the veterinary surgeons had given up.""",m
13481,"I picked the little creature up carefully, and was wending my way back to the cottage when the woman rushed to my side.",m
13482,"""You will let me help you, won't you?"" she said.",m
13483,"""I am so sorry for the poor little thing.""",m
13484,"Badly as I wanted to refuse her help, it was impossible to decline a woman's proffered kindness, and a few minutes later both the man and the woman had accompanied me to my little house, and I stood watching her, as with deft fingers she washed the poor little dog's wounds.",m
13485,"""There!"" she said when she had finished.",m
13486,"""I think he will be better now.",m
13487,"May I ask your servant to get me a basin of clean water so that I can wash my hands?""",m
13488,"As I have said in describing our last meeting, she was one of the handsomest women I had ever seen, and I quickly discovered that she was more than ordinarily intelligent.",m
13489,"How it was I do not know, because I am not quick to form acquaintances, but in a few minutes I had ordered Simpson to bring refreshments, and was talking with them freely.",m
13490,They told me that they were staying at a furnished house near St.,m
13491,"Eia, that they had been staying there for some months and intended remaining instead of returning to London.",m
13492,"""I hate London,"" said the woman, ""and I love the quiet peacefulness of this neighborhood.",m
13493,"Besides, I do not think it is safe to live in London.",m
13494,"The Germans intend to raid London, and they will throw bombs all over the city.",m
13495,"No one will be safe.""",m
13496,"This led to a general conversation about the war, and about the cruelty and baseness of the Germans in attacking defenseless ships and murdering women and children.",m
13497,"In spite of myself, too, I found that I was subjected to a kind of cross-examination, and yet no one listening could have detected a question which could have in the slightest degree been regarded as suspicious, but here my lawyer's training came to my aid, and I was careful to drop no hint of any suspicions I might entertain.",m
13498,"When they had gone I heaved a sigh of relief, although, truth to tell, the woman's presence had fascinated me.",m
13499,"I wondered who she was, and could not help asking myself if there was not some motive behind that which appeared on the surface, actuating them to find their way into my little cottage.",m
13500,"""Simpson,"" I said, when they had gone, ""what did you think of those people?""",m
13501,"""I think they are a very nice lady and gentleman,"" he said.",m
13502,"""The lady herself was very charming.""",m
13503,"""You liked her, did you?""",m
13504,I said.,m
13505,"""I always say, sir, that when a dumb animal takes to a person there is nothing much wrong with that person.",m
13506,"Now that little dog, sir, was afraid of his life of the man, but did you see how grateful he was to the lady?",m
13507,"And no wonder, sir!",m
13508,"She treated him as if he were a Christian.""",m
13509,"""Which way have they gone, Simpson?""",m
13510,"""They went towards St.",m
13511,"Eia, sir.""",m
13512,I hesitated a second.,m
13513,"I did not like to take Simpson into my confidence, neither was I pleased at the thought that I had been discussing my visitors with him; still, he was an old servant, and, as I have frequently said, I regarded him more in the light of a friend than a servant.",m
13514,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""just follow them, will you, and see where they go and what they do.""",m
13515,"""Yes, sir,"" he said, but I could see that he was astonished at my request.",m
13516,Half an hour later he returned.,m
13517,"""Please, sir,"" he said, ""they went along the St.",m
13518,"Eia footpath, and then turned off as if they meant to go to Chy-an-Wheal.""",m
13519,"Of course there was nothing suspicious in this, and yet my mind was not at ease.",m
13520,"I had never been a man given to morbid fancies, and had always been too much a materialist to pay attention to people who profess to believe in premonitions; and yet my meeting with this man and woman had again stirred a thousand fancies in my mind, while the little creature sleeping on the rug seemed in some way to cause vague fears to come into my mind.",m
13521,Perhaps this was because of the state of my health.,m
13522,"It seemed to me that my life, humdrum and commonplace though it might appear, was surrounded by mystery.",m
13523,I had vague intuitions which had no basis of reason.,m
13524,After a time I rose and went out.,m
13525,I wanted to shake off the feelings which possessed me.,m
13526,"A few minutes later I was scrambling down the cliff-side, hidden by the thick scrub of bushes.",m
13527,"Presently I had a view of the whole of the little bay, which seemed absolutely deserted.",m
13528,"I was far from fit to undertake what I had planned to do, but I could not resist the impulse which possessed me.",m
13529,"I descended farther, and soon I was at the foot of the cliffs, looking eagerly around me.",m
13530,"I found my way into the cave, but there was nothing suspicious there.",m
13531,Evidently no one had visited it since the last high tide.,m
13532,The sandy floor was untrodden; there were no marks of any one having been there.,m
13533,"I crept out again, but still no one was visible.",m
13534,"""What a fool I am,"" I said to myself.",m
13535,"""I am like a nervous child following a will-o'-the-wisp of my own fancies.""",m
13536,"Still, what I had seen and heard could not be without meaning.",m
13537,I could have sworn to the fact that I had heard people at this very spot only a few hours before.,m
13538,"I had heard a man say, ""Is that the lot?"" and some one had given him an indistinct reply.",m
13539,"Of course this might have meant nothing, and yet I was sure it had.",m
13540,"Again I examined the rocks inch by inch, but my search was altogether unrewarded.",m
13541,"I passed the little fissure which led to the cave again, and this time I saw what I had never seen before.",m
13542,"In an obscure corner, not far from the entrance, was another fissure.",m
13543,"It was very narrow, but still wide enough for a man to squeeze his body through.",m
13544,"I wondered why I had never seen it before, but on reexamining it I realized that it was so curiously formed, that any one with only a match to illuminate the cave could easily miss it.",m
13545,"I squeezed myself through the fissure, and found myself in a cave far larger than the first.",m
13546,In an instant the mystery of the last few months became plain to me.,m
13547,The new cave was as perfect a hiding-place as could possibly be found.,m
13548,Altogether there must have been some hundreds of cans of petrol placed there.,m
13549,This petrol was by different makers.,m
13550,"Evidently it had been bought in comparatively small quantities at various places, and had been brought there to be ready for use as necessity arose.",m
13551,I understood now the meaning of the words I had heard only a little while before.,m
13552,"""Is that the lot?""",m
13553,What the speaker meant was evident.,m
13554,"He had brought a consignment of petrol to this lonely spot, and his words referred to what I saw around me.",m
13555,I realized also the significance of what Father Abraham had said to me during his midnight visit.,m
13556,Evidently he knew what the cave contained when he said that I was standing on a powder magazine.,m
13557,According to my calculations it was almost immediately under my little wooden hut.,m
13558,"When I had asked him whether he spoke figuratively or literally, he had replied, ""Both.""",m
13559,"I remembered, too, the article I had seen in the London newspaper.",m
13560,The writer of this article had asked where the Germans had been able to obtain the petrol which enabled them to do their devilish work by means of submarines.,m
13561,Now it was plain.,m
13562,"This cave, curiously hidden in the rocky cliff in a quiet, far-away spot on the Cornish coast, suited their purpose admirably.",m
13563,I myself had visited the outer cave on more than one occasion and yet had not discovered it.,m
13564,"How many lives, I wondered, had been lost by the stuff which had been stored in this place!",m
13565,I called to mind the times when I had seen phantom-like boats coming round the headland.,m
13566,I remembered how I had puzzled as to what they might mean.,m
13567,"Now all was plain; this rocky cliff, although far away from the centre of operations, was important beyond words.",m
13568,Evidently those who had been engaged in this work had cleverly avoided the coast watchers.,m
13569,"Quietly and unsuspectingly they had brought cargo after cargo, and when the submarines had need of petrol they had been able to supply them.",m
13570,"All this flashed through my mind in a second, then the match by means of which I had made my discovery went out.",m
13571,"I realized the awful danger by which I was surrounded; doubtless all these cans were carefully sealed, yet I knew that one spark might ignite this highly combustible fluid, and I should be burnt to death.",m
13572,But that was the smallest part of my danger.,m
13573,I knew that the men who were engaged in this work would stop at nothing; that the spies who had sought out this lonely cave would be ready to do anything in order to keep a secret.,m
13574,A hundred wild fancies surged through my brain.,m
13575,I saw now why Father Abraham had been driven from his hut.,m
13576,"What his connections with the Germans were I had no idea, but evidently he had been regarded as dangerous to their plans.",m
13577,"That, doubtless, was the reason why the old man had warned me.",m
13578,"His words came flashing back to my mind, and revealed to me the fact that I had been under constant surveillance.",m
13579,Then I thought of the man and woman who had lately visited me.,m
13580,What was the meaning of their interest in me?,m
13581,"Were they what they pretended, or had they some sinister motive in asking me questions?",m
13582,My discovery made the necessity of action imperative.,m
13583,But what could I do?,m
13584,"Here was I, a poor invalid, and, if Dr. Rhomboid was right, I had only a few weeks longer to live.",m
13585,"I had, as it seemed to me, only kept myself alive by my strong will power and determination that I would not yield to death.",m
13586,But what could I do?,m
13587,"I had by this time learnt something of the police officials in the neighborhood, and I knew how utterly incapable they were of dealing with the matter.",m
13588,"I was acquainted with some magistrates in the district, but I feared to go to them; a man like Squire Treherne would be utterly incapable of dealing with such a delicate situation.",m
13589,"I knew that in his blunt, straightforward, honest way he would muddle everything.",m
13590,"It is true I might write to the War Office or to the Admiralty, but, rightly or wrongly, I did not form a high estimate of their way of doing things; and yet I could see nothing else for it.",m
13591,Even now I might be watched.,m
13592,Even now German agents might be waiting outside the cave to pounce upon me.,m
13593,"I lit another match, and saw something which had hitherto escaped my notice.",m
13594,It was a slip of paper.,m
13595,"I snatched at it eagerly and carefully read it, my heart beating wildly all the time.",m
13596,The light again went out.,m
13597,"How long I remained there in the darkness I do not know, but it seemed to me as though I lived years in a few minutes.",m
13598,A wild scheme flashed through my brain.,m
13599,I would deal with this matter alone!,m
13600,"I could not fight for my country, but I would serve it in my own way.",m
13601,"I listened intently, but could hear nothing save the dull monotone of the waves outside.",m
13602,No whispering voices reached me.,m
13603,The darkness of the cave seemed to intensify the silence.,m
13604,I crept into the outer cave and again listened; still all was silent.,m
13605,"Then I made my way into the daylight, taking every precaution before doing so.",m
13606,"No, as far as I could tell no curious eyes were watching me.",m
13607,I was alone.,m
13608,XXIII  A CLUE TO THE MYSTERY   I seemed to have a fresh lease of life as I clambered up the rocky cliff towards my hut.,m
13609,"I had no sense of weariness or weakness at all; it might seem as though all my fears had been groundless, and that Dr. Rhomboid had been utterly mistaken.",m
13610,I expect this was because of the great excitement under which I labored.,m
13611,Every nerve in my body was in tension; at that moment nothing seemed impossible to me.,m
13612,"My mind, I remember, seemed as vigorous as my body, and I felt as though I was walking on air.",m
13613,The possibilities of what I had discovered might mean putting an end to one of the greatest dangers which had been threatening our country.,m
13614,"From what I could judge, this might be one of the principal store places of petrol.",m
13615,"I realized, as I had never realized before, the cleverness of the German mind.",m
13616,"No one, I imagined, would think of this out-of-the-way district as a possible centre of their operations.",m
13617,Naturally the whole of the East Coast from Dover to the extreme North of Scotland would be watched with the greatest care; but who would have thought they would choose this out-of-the-way spot on the North of Cornwall?,m
13618,It might seem as though Providence had led me thither.,m
13619,"More than once on my way to the house did I stop and look eagerly around me, but I was always assured that no one watched me, and that I was utterly alone; besides, I could not have chosen a more perfect day for my investigation.",m
13620,"Although it was now near noon and the weather showed signs of breaking, a thick damp mist still enveloped the whole countryside, thus making observation from a distance almost impossible.",m
13621,"""Everything all right, sir?"" asked Simpson, as I entered the house.",m
13622,"""What should be wrong?"" was my reply.",m
13623,"""Nothing, sir, only you might have seen a ghost; you look terribly strange and excited, sir.""",m
13624,I laughed aloud.,m
13625,"""I have not felt so well for months, Simpson.""",m
13626,"He looked at me dubiously, I thought, and seemed anything but satisfied.",m
13627,"""Are you ready for your lunch, sir?""",m
13628,"""Lunch?""",m
13629,I replied.,m
13630,"""Haven't I had lunch?""",m
13631,"Making my way into my little bedroom, I caught a glimpse of my face.",m
13632,I hardly recognized myself!,m
13633,"Pale as I had always been since my illness, my pallor had been nothing to the white, drawn, haggard face which I saw in the glass.",m
13634,"But for the wild glitter in my eyes, it might have been the face of a dead man, and yet every particle of my being seemed instinct with life.",m
13635,"After pretending to eat some of the lunch which Simpson had prepared for me, an unusual languor crept over me, and throwing myself on the couch, I quickly fell asleep.",m
13636,"I was awakened by a sound of voices at the door, and I started up quickly.",m
13637,"As far as I could judge, I suffered no evil results from the excitement through which I had passed.",m
13638,"Whatever had caused me unnatural strength, its influence had not yet departed.",m
13639,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""whom have you got there?""",m
13640,"""I beg your pardon, sir, but I have just told Mr. Lethbridge that he could not see you.",m
13641,"I did not think you looked well, sir.""",m
13642,"""Show Mr. Lethbridge in.",m
13643,"I am perfectly all right.""",m
13644,"""I am afraid I should not have called,"" said Mr. Lethbridge, as he entered the room.",m
13645,"""You do not look well.""",m
13646,"""I am better than I have been for months,"" was my answer.",m
13647,"""Sit down, won't you?""",m
13648,"He gave me a quick, searching glance, and then took the chair to which I had pointed.",m
13649,There were marks of suffering in his face.,m
13650,"Although he was calm and collected and showed no signs of emotion whatever, I thought I saw in his eyes a strange, haunted look.",m
13651,"""I am afraid I did not receive you very cordially yesterday,"" he said presently.",m
13652,"""You see it--it was the shock.""",m
13653,"""Of course it was,"" was my answer.",m
13654,"""I understand how you must be feeling.""",m
13655,"""Do you?"" he replied wearily.",m
13656,"""I don't.""",m
13657,"""Don't what?""",m
13658,I asked.,m
13659,"""Understand.",m
13660,I understand nothing.,m
13661,I am bewildered.,m
13662,"I am in hell.""",m
13663,He spoke very quietly although his voice was strained and somewhat hoarse.,m
13664,"""You didn't sleep last night,"" I suggested.",m
13665,"""No,"" he replied, with a sigh, ""I didn't sleep.",m
13666,"I suppose I am regarded as a hard man, Mr. Erskine?""",m
13667,To this I made no reply.,m
13668,"I knew he was passing through a terrible experience, and, strange as it may seem, I wanted to do nothing to lighten his burden.",m
13669,"""I don't know why I have come to you at all,"" he went on.",m
13670,"""You are a comparative stranger to me--indeed, a few months ago I did not know of your existence--and yet something drew me here.",m
13671,"I suppose it is because you were fond of him.""",m
13672,"""I loved him almost like a brother,"" was my reply.",m
13673,"""If I had been his father, I should be a proud man.""",m
13674,He looked at me steadily for a few minutes in silence.,m
13675,"""I have learnt one thing anyhow,"" he said at length.",m
13676,"""What is that?""",m
13677,"""That one cannot destroy the ties of blood.",m
13678,Yes!,m
13679,Yes!,m
13680,I know I had disinherited him; driven him from home; told him he was no longer a son of mine.,m
13681,Yes! told him that I had put him outside my life.,m
13682,But it was a lie!,m
13683,I had not!,m
13684,I could not!,m
13685,"Oh, the tragedy of it!""",m
13686,"""Yes, tragedy in a way,"" I said.",m

13688,"""No, it is not death that makes the tragedy, it is something else.",m
13689,I can't understand it.,m
13690,"Mr. Erskine, I am a just man.""",m
13691,At this I was silent.,m
13692,I could not for the life of me assent to his words.,m
13693,"""Yes, I am a just man,"" he repeated.",m
13694,"""That is, I have tried to be just.",m
13695,"I did what was right, too; he ought to have obeyed me.",m
13696,"I was his father, and it is the duty of a son to obey a father; besides, I had done everything for him.",m
13697,I sent him to one of the best public schools in England.,m
13698,After that I sent him to the University.,m
13699,I had great plans for him.,m
13700,But he disappointed me.,m
13701,He married the girl I told him he must not marry; he did that which I forbade him to do; therefore I was right in driving him from the house.,m
13702,"But it was all of no use; he was my son still.""",m
13703,"""Of course he was,"" I said.",m
13704,"""Ah, yes! but there is the tragedy of it.",m
13705,"He has died feeling that he was not my son, remembering what I said to him.",m
13706,That is the tragedy!,m
13707,"Oh, how God Almighty must be laughing at me!""",m
13708,"""Not if there is a God,"" I replied.",m
13709,"""Why, don't you believe in God?"" he burst forth almost angrily.",m
13710,"""I don't know,"" I replied.",m
13711,"""But if there is a God, He pities you.""",m
13712,He started to his feet and paced the little room while I stood watching him.,m
13713,"""God! how I loved that boy,"" he broke out, ""and he didn't know it!""",m
13714,"""Yes,"" I said, ""that is the tragedy.",m
13715,"That is the unforgivable sin.""",m
13716,"""Go on,"" he said.",m
13717,"""Say what you want to say.""",m
13718,"""Hugh was hungering for your love, just hungering for it; but he didn't believe you cared for him.",m
13719,"You ask me to speak plainly, Mr. Lethbridge, and so, at the risk of offending you, I am going to do so.",m
13720,"You had your hard-and-fast ideas about life; you worshipped success, position, power, and money; you wanted Hugh to conform to your iron rules and laws, and because he was a live, human boy you tried to crush him.""",m
13721,"""Yes! yes!",m
13722,"I know.""",m
13723,He spoke almost eagerly.,m
13724,"""But even now I cannot feel right about it.",m
13725,"After all, war is murder.",m
13726,"How can I, a Christian man, a believer in the teaching of the founder of Methodism, believe that my son was anything but murdered?",m
13727,"After all, is not a soldier a paid murderer?",m
13728,I think if I could only get that right in my mind I should be happier.,m
13729,Look here!,m
13730,"Do you honestly believe that Hugh did right?""",m
13731,"""I don't believe;",m
13732,"I am sure,"" was my reply.",m
13733,"""Ah! but you don't believe in Christian teaching.",m
13734,You told me months ago that you were an agnostic.,m
13735,"Legalized murder cannot be right.""",m
13736,"""Mr. Lethbridge,"" I said, ""supposing there lived in this neighborhood a band of men without moral sense, without honor, without truth; men to whom you could not appeal because their standards of life were utterly opposed to yours.",m
13737,"And suppose that by rapine, cruelty, and murder they sought to rule this district, to rob people of their homes, to outrage everything sacred in life.",m
13738,"What do you think it would be your duty to do?""",m
13739,"""Yes! yes!",m
13740,I see what you mean.,m
13741,But are the Germans like that?,m
13742,"Aren't they as good and as honorable as we are?""",m
13743,"""Listen!""",m
13744,I said.,m
13745,"""I have just been reading some German books and reviews, and this is what some of the leading men in Germany have lately said.",m

13747,They express the thoughts which dominate the population of Germany.,m

13749,"Whatever acts will help us, we shall commit them, no matter what the world may say.",m
13750,"Germany stands as the Supreme Arbiter of her own actions, and however the world may rave at our cruelty and our atrocities, our devilry, we shall commit these deeds, we shall rejoice in them, and we shall be proud of them.'""  ""Who said that?"" he asked.",m
13751,"""A leading General in the German Army,"" I replied.",m
13752,"""Here is another statement by a renowned Doctor of Philosophy and an educationist: 'Children in our schools and the youths of our universities must be taught a new doctrine, the Doctrine of Hatred.",m
13753,"They must be educated to hate as a duty; it must form a new subject in our curriculum of education, ""And now abideth Faith, Hope, and Hatred, and the greatest of these is Hatred.""'""  ""You don't mean to say that any man taught that?"" he asked.",m
13754,"""Here is the article in a German book,"" I replied.",m
13755,"""My God!"" he said.",m
13756,"""Here is another statement,"" I went on, ""by perhaps the leading journalist in the German Empire: 'Our might shall create new laws.",m

13761,"""Hugh gave his life to kill that,"" I said.",m
13762,"""Is not that a Christian thing to do?""",m
13763,"He sat, I should think, for five minutes without speaking a word, while I watched him.",m
13764,Then he rose to his feet and held out his hand.,m
13765,"""Thank you,"" he said, ""thank you.",m
13766,"My God! what a fool I have been.""",m
13767,He left the house without speaking another word.,m
13768,I went to the door and watched him as he made his way along the footpath through the copse.,m
13769,I saw that the mists had now passed away and that the sun was shining brightly.,m
13770,"Strange as it may seem, I did not at that moment realize the inwardness of my conversation with Josiah Lethbridge;",m
13771,I only reflected upon the fact that although he was a magistrate I had said nothing to him concerning my discovery of that morning.,m
13772,"He at least was a keen, capable man, he could act wisely and promptly; yet I had not uttered a word.",m
13773,"But after all I had done right; the problem he was facing was different from mine, and he would be in no way in a fit condition to help me.",m
13774,"Besides, I had made up my mind to carry out my own plans.",m
13775,"No one else came to see me that day, and during the remainder of the afternoon and evening I remained alone, thinking of what I ought to do.",m
13776,I still felt strong and capable.,m
13777,"I suffered no pain, neither did any sense of weariness oppress me.",m
13778,"""That little dog, sir,"" said Simpson, coming into the room about sunset.",m
13779,"""Yes, Simpson?",m
13780,"What of it?""",m
13781,"""It is a lot better, sir.",m
13782,"The wound was not a bad one at all, and now he is getting quite frolicsome.""",m
13783,The dog had followed Simpson into the room and was sniffing at my legs in a friendly way.,m
13784,"""Poor old chap,"" I said, patting his head;",m
13785,"""you are not very beautiful certainly, but you look as though you had faithful eyes.""",m
13786,He gave a pleased yelp and licked my hand; after this he lay down on the rug and composed himself to sleep.,m
13787,"""Evidently he has adopted us, Simpson,"" I said.",m
13788,"""Yes, sir.",m
13789,"He makes himself quite at home.""",m
13790,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""you have the name and address of that man and woman who came to see me this morning?""",m
13791,"""Yes, sir, here's the card: Mr. John Liddicoat.",m
13792,"There's the name of the house, sir.""",m
13793,"""Do you know where it is, Simpson?""",m
13794,"""Yes, sir; it is a house just behind Treveen Tor.",m
13795,"It is a biggish house, sir, but lonely.""",m
13796,"That night when Simpson had gone to bed, I left my hut quietly and made my way along the cliff footpath towards Treveen Tor, which stands at the back of the little town of St.",m
13797,Eia.,m
13798,"I still felt well and strong, no suggestion of my malady troubled me.",m
13799,"I could not help wondering at this, as I walked briskly along, and yet in my heart of hearts I knew that my abnormal strength was but a transient thing;",m
13800,"I knew I was buoyed up by excitement, and that presently I should suffer a terrible relapse.",m
13801,That was why I was eager to do what I had to do quickly.,m
13802,As I skirted the little town of St.,m
13803,Eia I saw that the lights were nearly all out.,m
13804,"I looked at my watch, and found that it was eleven o'clock, and the people had nearly all gone to bed.",m
13805,"It was a wonderful night of stars, and there was not a cloud in the sky.",m
13806,"The moon had not yet risen, but I knew it was due to rise before midnight.",m
13807,During the whole of my journey I had not met a single person.,m
13808,"The night, save for the roar of the waves, was still as death.",m
13809,"Leaving the cliff footpath, I struck across the country towards Treveen Tor, and went around the base of the hill towards the spot where Mr. John Liddicoat's house stood.",m
13810,"Had any one asked me the reason for going there, I should have been unable to have given them a satisfactory reply.",m
13811,But in my own heart I was satisfied.,m
13812,"I had carefully thought out the whole series of events, linking incident with incident and word with word; and although I had no definite hopes as to the result of my nocturnal journey, I felt sure that by taking it I should at least clear my ground.",m
13813,"Presently I saw the house plainly; it was, as Simpson had said, situated in a lonely spot, and only approached by a lonely lane from the St.",m
13814,Eia side and the footpath by which I had come.,m
13815,The house itself was in complete darkness; not a glimmer of light shone from any of the windows.,m
13816,"I saw that it was surrounded by a garden, perhaps half an acre in extent.",m
13817,"This garden was, as far as I could judge, altogether uncultivated.",m
13818,"The fence around the garden was low, and scarcely any vegetation hid my view.",m
13819,The district around here was almost treeless.,m
13820,"The land on which the house was built was, in the main, hard to cultivate.",m
13821,"I saw, however, that two stunted trees grew at some little distance from the house.",m
13822,I waited about a quarter of an hour without making any attempt to climb over the fence.,m
13823,"I reflected that if my suspicions were correct, I must use every precaution.",m
13824,At the end of a quarter of an hour I crept cautiously over the fence and made my way towards the house.,m
13825,Still all was dark.,m
13826,"I carefully examined the ground around the two stunted trees I have mentioned, and presently I caught sight of something which set my heart beating violently.",m
13827,"I was on the point of making a closer examination of what I had already seen, when a ray of light shone from one of the windows and I could hear the sound of voices.",m
13828,"Again looking around me eagerly, I saw what looked like a large clump of rhododendron bushes.",m
13829,"These offered me not only a hiding-place, but a post of observation.",m
13830,I had scarcely crept between the leaves when the door of John Liddicoat's house opened and two people came out.,m
13831,They were the man and the woman whom I had seen that morning.,m
13832,"Almost at the same time the moon rose behind a distant hill, and a few minutes later the garden was flooded with its silvery light.",m
13833,"""Have you got it all?""",m
13834,It was a woman who spoke.,m
13835,"""Yes, all except ..."" and I could not catch the last word.",m
13836,"""You bring it, will you?""",m
13837,"They made their way towards the stunted trees, where they dropped the things they had brought.",m
13838,Then the man left the woman and appeared a little later bearing a light ladder.,m
13839,"I saw the man place his ladder against the tree and mount it, carrying something with him, what it was I could not tell.",m
13840,"The moon had now risen high enough to enable me to see more plainly and to show me that the two worked swiftly and dexterously, as though they were accustomed to their work.",m
13841,"Presently they had evidently finished, for they stood still and waited for something.",m
13842,"""I do not expect we shall get anything to-night.""",m
13843,It was the woman who spoke.,m
13844,"""There is no knowing,"" replied the man;",m
13845,"""besides, we have our orders.",m
13846,"It is a calm night, too.""",m
13847,"""What time is it?"" asked the woman.",m
13848,"""Close on midnight,"" was the reply.",m
13849,"""Anyhow, we must wait here until half-past twelve; if nothing comes by that time we shall hear nothing until to-morrow night.",m
13850,"My word, if that fool of a fellow who lives in the hut on the cliff only knew!",m
13851,"For my own part, I am not sure he does not suspect.""",m
13852,"""What makes you think so?""",m
13853,"""I thought he was very guarded this morning,"" replied the man, ""and I must use every means to make certain; if we bungle this we shall be in a bad way.",m
13854,"Anyhow, he is closely watched night and day.""",m
13855,"After this there was silence, save that I thought I heard a faint clicking noise.",m
13856,The minutes dragged heavily.,m
13857,It seemed as though nothing were going to happen.,m
13858,"The moon rose higher and higher, revealing the outlines of the man and woman still more plainly, and presently I saw that their waiting had been rewarded.",m
13859,There was a clear repetition of the sounds I had heard previously.,m
13860,"Then the woman said, ""Have you got it?""",m
13861,"""Yes,"" replied the man;",m
13862,"""we will take it in, and then our work for the night is done.""",m
13863,A few minutes later the man climbed the ladder again; evidently he was detaching something he had placed on the trees.,m
13864,"I waited and watched perhaps for another ten minutes, and then they went back into the house which had remained in darkness all the time.",m
13865,XXIV  PREPARATION   How I got back to my little hut that night I do not know.,m
13866,"I have not a distinct remembrance of any incident on the journey, or of any spot that I passed.",m
13867,I was unconscious of all my surroundings;,m
13868,"I must have walked two or three miles, being utterly oblivious all the time of where I was.",m
13869,"I felt no sense of weariness, being still upheld by the unnatural strength caused by my excitement.",m
13870,"A part of my journey led me to a footpath which skirted the cliff, and for hundreds of yards I walked on the edge of a precipice.",m
13871,But I knew nothing of it.,m
13872,What I had seen and heard told their own story.,m
13873,"My life, which had promised to be so uneventful, proved to be exciting beyond words.",m
13874,"I had by some curious chance happened to come upon a spot which was, in some respects, the centre of German operations.",m
13875,What had been a mystery had now become plain to me.,m
13876,The scrap of paper I had found in the little cave had made all sorts of things possible.,m
13877,It had led me to John Liddicoat's house; it had enabled me to understand actions which would have otherwise been enshrouded in mystery.,m
13878,Who John Liddicoat and the woman who called herself his sister were was plain--they were German spies.,m
13879,Whether they were English or German I could not tell.,m
13880,Certainly they spoke the English language as though they had been born and reared on the British Isles; but that they were paid agents of the Kaiser there could be no doubt.,m
13881,I little thought at the time I had paid my visit to the wireless station at M---- that it would have been fraught with such vital import.,m
13882,"It seemed to me as though the hand of Providence had guided me there, and had led me to form an acquaintance with the young fellow who had insisted upon teaching me the secrets of wireless telegraphy.",m
13883,What I had learnt offered me boundless opportunities.,m
13884,"The little apparatus, which not long before I had regarded as an interesting plaything, became of vital importance.",m
13885,"Vast avenues of action opened themselves up before me; by means of this little apparatus which I had found such interest in constructing, I might do very great things.",m
13886,"The man Liddicoat, by means of the two stunted trees in his garden, and the apparatus which he had fixed there, had been enabled to receive messages from the enemy.",m
13887,"He had been able to learn when new supplies of petrol were to be brought, and when consignments of this same commodity had to be taken to the German submarines.",m
13888,"Nothing could be more cunningly contrived; the little cove was hidden by huge promontories, which rose up almost perpendicularly on the rock-bound coast.",m
13889,"The spot was far away from all centres of population, and was such an unlikely place that no suspicion would be attached to it.",m
13890,"Liddicoat was an English name, and a name closely associated with Cornwall.",m
13891,St.,m
13892,"Eia was a little town where visitors often came, and thus he would be able to do his work unhindered and unsuspected.",m
13893,Evidently the Germans in their vast preparations had learned of this cave long before the war and had seen its possibilities; what I had discovered was the outcome of a carefully prepared plan.,m
13894,Of course there was much mystery which I had not yet been able to solve.,m
13895,"The part which Father Abraham had played was not yet clear to me, and I found myself hazarding all sorts of conjectures, as to why he had built the hut there and why he had left it.",m
13896,"But everything resolved itself into one interpretation--the Germans had foreseen this war, they had conjectured the course it would take.",m
13897,"They understood the means which would have to be used, and they had made their preparations carefully, scientifically, and with vast forethought.",m
13898,But what could I do?,m
13899,Evidently I was suspected.,m
13900,"Even now, my house was being watched night and day;",m
13901,"Father Abraham knew this, and had warned me to leave it.",m
13902,Unseen enemies might strike me down at any moment.,m
13903,"And worse than all, although at that time I was buoyed up by an unnatural strength, I was little better than a dead man.",m
13904,"I realized that I was opposed to those who were entirely unscrupulous, and who would allow nothing to stand in the way of the accomplishment of their schemes.",m
13905,"Doubtless, my wise course would be to write an exact description of all I had seen and heard and send it to the Government authorities without delay.",m
13906,"If, as I suspected, Liddicoat was associated with an unscrupulous set of people, he would not hesitate to end my earthly career.",m
13907,"In that case, unless I communicated with the authorities at once, my discoveries would be valueless; and yet with a strange obstinacy I determined that I would not do this.",m
13908,"As I have said repeatedly, I was at that time buoyed up by an unnatural strength, and my mind was abnormally active.",m
13909,"That is how I account for a determination which, in the light of after events, seems insane.",m
13910,"Government authorities would be in an infinitely better position to deal with this combination of circumstances than I. Not only would they have every facility at their disposal, but they would have a vast knowledge of German methods.",m
13911,"I, on the other hand, had but few facilities.",m
13912,"I was almost entirely ignorant of the means they were constantly using, and I was alone!",m
13913,Yet I adhered to my determination with that strange obstinacy which characterizes a man who is in an unnatural condition of mind and body.,m
13914,"I vowed that I would see this thing through myself; that I would put together all the pieces of this intricate mosaic and bring the guilty persons to justice; then, when I had done my work, I would present it to the Government.",m
13915,This and a thousand other thoughts flashed through my mind during my midnight journey from John Liddicoat's house to my little hut.,m
13916,"I was conscious of no danger, and I am afraid I was heedless as to who might be watching me.",m
13917,I found myself in my little room without realizing that I had opened the door and entered.,m
13918,Almost like a man in a dream I lit my lamp and threw myself in an armchair.,m
13919,"I had no thought of sleep, and my mind was still preternaturally active.",m
13920,Then a sense of my utter helplessness possessed me and a great fear filled my heart.,m
13921,"I went to the door, opened it slightly, and listened.",m
13922,"It was a wonderful night; the moon sailed in a cloudless sky, and I could see the shimmer of the sea far out from land.",m
13923,"No sound reached me save the roll of the waves on the sandy beach; not a breath of wind stirred, not a leaf rustled.",m
13924,"Locking and bolting the door, I drew some paper from a drawer and commenced writing.",m
13925,"How long I wrote I do not know, but I did not stop until I had penned a fairly comprehensive precis of what I had seen and heard.",m
13926,Why I did this I cannot tell;,m
13927,"I only know that I was driven to it by some force which, to me, was inexplicable.",m
13928,"This done, I signed the paper, giving the hour and date when I had written it.",m
13929,I heard Simpson turning in his bed in the little room close by.,m
13930,"""Simpson,"" I said, going to him, ""are you awake?""",m
13931,He yawned drowsily.,m
13932,"""Simpson, are you awake?""",m
13933,I repeated.,m
13934,"""Yes, sir,"" he said, starting up.",m
13935,"""Is anything the matter, sir?",m
13936,"Are you well?""",m
13937,"""Quite well, Simpson.""",m
13938,"""Is it time to get up, sir?""",m
13939,"""I--I--what time it is I don't know, Simpson, but it is not time to get up.""",m
13940,He looked at me like one afraid.,m
13941,"""Can I do anything for you, sir?""",m
13942,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""I want you to take this paper and put it away in a place of safety.",m
13943,"You must not open it unless something happens to me.""",m
13944,"""Happens to you, sir?",m
13945,"What can happen to you?""",m
13946,"""I don't know--nothing, most likely.",m
13947,But I am giving this to you in case there should.,m
13948,Don't be alarmed.,m
13949,"If nothing happens to me, let it lie in a place of safety, and give it to me when I ask for it, but if anything should happen....""",m
13950,"""Yes, sir,"" he said eagerly, as I hesitated.",m
13951,"""If anything should happen, sir?""",m
13952,"""Then--then you will take this to Mr. Josiah Lethbridge!""",m
13953,"""Mr. Josiah Lethbridge, sir?""",m
13954,"""Yes, take it to him immediately.",m
13955,"You must not delay a second.""",m
13956,"""But what can happen to you, sir?""",m
13957,"""I know of nothing,"" I replied.",m
13958,"""I am only taking a precaution.",m
13959,"That is all, Simpson.",m
13960,"Good-night.""",m
13961,"I held the lamp in my hand as I spoke, while Simpson sat up in his bed staring at me.",m
13962,"""Excuse me, sir,"" he said, ""but--but----"" and then he put his hand under the pillow and took out his watch.",m
13963,"""It is half-past three, sir, it won't be long before daylight; and--and haven't you been to bed, sir?""",m
13964,"""Good-night, Simpson,"" I said, and then found my way into my little room.",m
13965,"Five minutes later, I had got into bed, and blown out the lamp.",m
13966,"I was still strangely awake, and was again living over my experiences of the night.",m
13967,"I heard Simpson groping cautiously around the house, and I knew he was looking at the fastenings of windows and doors.",m
13968,"""I shall have a busy day to-morrow,"" I said to myself.",m
13969,"""I must see that my little wireless apparatus is in good order.",m
13970,"I must be careful, too, that I arouse no suspicion in placing it on the spot I have prepared.""",m
13971,After this I began to arrange my plans concerning the work I had to do.,m
13972,"Then, little by little, things became hazy and indistinct to me.",m
13973,"""I am falling asleep,"" I said to myself.",m
13974,"""This is wonderful;",m
13975,"I never thought I should sleep to-night.""",m
13976,"I seemed to be passing through one world into another, from the world of realities to the world of dreams, and yet the latter was as real to me as the former had been.",m
13977,"I had a kind of consciousness that I was asleep, and yet the stuff of which my dreams were made was just as vivid as my experiences of that night.",m
13978,"I was far out at sea, but it was not such a sea as I had ever known.",m
13979,"I felt the movement of the waters, and heard the roar of the machinery.",m
13980,But I could see nothing.,m

14297,Such was the power she had over me; but all the time I knew there was an unbreakable barrier between us.,m
14298,"Something, I could not tell what, repelled me, made me adamant.",m
14299,"At that time, too, I was in a strange condition of mind.",m
14300,"All I had told her was true; although I felt strong and full of life, I knew that the Angel of Death had spread his wings over me; that, in spite of my power to walk and act quickly, death was even then undermining the citadels of life.",m
14301,"In a sense life was not real to me at all; everything was intangible, visionary.",m
14302,I was like a man in a dream.,m
14303,"*       *       *       *       *  It is now early in May, and, as I said to Isabella Lethbridge this morning, it is within a fortnight of the end of the year which Dr. Rhomboid gave me to live.",m
14304,"I commenced writing this narrative last autumn, when the days were shortening and the long evenings were dreary and lonely.",m
14305,"I feel now that I have got to the end of my story, and that I shall never tell of what may yet happen to me.",m
14306,"I don't think I am a nervous or fanciful man, and, as far as I can remember in what I have written, there is nothing in my history to suggest that I am superstitious or carried away by old wives' tales.",m
14307,And yet I have a conviction that I have come to the end of my life; that I shall soon learn the great secret--if there is any secret in death.,m
14308,"I don't feel ill, rather my body seems instinct with life;",m
14309,I am buoyed up by an unnatural strength;,m
14310,"I am capable of thinking, of acting--yet something tells me that I am near the end.",m
14311,"I have been writing for hours, so as to bring my records up to this point.",m
14312,"Why I have done so I cannot tell, except that I have obeyed an overmastering impulse.",m
14313,"At six o'clock this evening I arranged my wireless apparatus, so as to be ready for any news that should come to me.",m
14314,I have also sent Simpson to St.,m
14315,"Issey with certain instructions which seem to be necessary, and I have taken all precautions of which I can think to render what I am going to try and do effective.",m
14316,"What will the future bring forth, I wonder?",m
14317,What will be the result of my plans?,m
14318,"Will everything come to nothing, or will my dreams be realized?",m
14319,"I know that if I acted according to the dictates of common sense, I should at once send Simpson with a long telegram to the authorities at Falmouth or Penzance.",m
14320,But with that strange obstinacy which possesses me I refuse to do this;,m
14321,"I am acting according to impulse or intuition, rather than in obedience to reason.",m
14322,"Concerning the deeper things of life and death, I am almost as much in the dark as I was when I came here nearly a year ago; and yet not altogether.",m
14323,The subtle change which has come over the life of the village has affected me.,m
14324,The faith which has been renewed in the lives of so many people has created an atmosphere which I cannot help but breathe.,m
14325,"Even now, although I feel death to be so near, I have a kind of intuition that I cannot die.",m
14326,"I cannot say that I believe in God, but there is only a thin line of partition between me and that belief.",m
14327,"Life is the same as it has been, and yet it is not the same.",m
14328,"A new element has appeared, a new force has made itself felt, but what that force is I cannot tell.",m
14329,"During the last few weeks, although I have said nothing about it, I have been reading the New Testament, a book I had not looked at since I left Oxford.",m
14330,Especially have I studied the Gospels.,m
14331,"They are very wonderful, in some parts sublime.",m
14332,But I have not learnt the secret of the Man Jesus.,m
14333,I cannot rid my mind of the thought that He was a visionary.,m
14334,And yet I don't know; there are times when I cannot get away from the belief that His words were founded on the Rock of Truth.,m
14335,"When I came back from the prayer-meeting the other night, I felt as though Jesus said to me what He said to the man in olden times who asked Him questions, ""Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.""",m
14336,"But everything was transitory and passed away in a moment, and I was left dull and unconvinced.",m
14337,And here I leave it.,m
14338,"I am a young man, little over thirty years of age, with life's work undone and life's problems unsolved.",m
14339,"If this life is all, then it is a mockery, a haggard failure, an unfulfilled promise, an uncompleted plan.",m
14340,"And yet I don't know; even although I were certain that there is nothing beyond, I am still glad that I have had my life.",m
14341,"But if there be a Supreme Being, would He give me life and hope, and volition and possibilities, only to destroy that life?",m
14342,I felt as I never felt before--that my body is not my real self; that the essential I is distinct from the body.,m
14343,"These premonitions of mine, what do they signify?",m
14344,Certainly they prove a sensitiveness to something which is beyond my power of understanding; but is that all?,m
14345,"Never did I feel as I feel now the utter uselessness of mere intellectuality, of material advancement, of scientific discovery, and the thousand other things which men strive after when divorced from faith, divorced from God.",m
14346,"I feel that Science, Philosophy, have no answer to give me, and the wisdom of men is but as the voice of the wandering wind.",m
14347,"If I believed in God, if I were sure of God, sure of the message which Jesus proclaimed, I could laugh at death; for I should know that out of discord would come harmony, and that out of incompleteness would come completeness.",m
14348,But that secret is not mine.,m
14349,I only dimly hope.,m
14350,But I will follow my fancies no further.,m
14351,I have my work to do.,m
14352,I have to carry out the plans I have made.,m
14353,XXVI  MIDNIGHT   Again I take up my pen to continue the narrative commenced long months ago.,m
14354,"Since I last looked at these pages, wonderful things have happened, so wonderful that I do not expect to be believed; but I will set them down nevertheless, and I will record them exactly as they took place.",m
14355,"In order to do this I must go back to that May evening in the year 1915, when, as it seemed to me, I had come to the end of my life.",m
14356,"As I have set down in these pages, I had, as I believed, made a discovery which seemed of importance to the nation, and pierced a mystery which had been baffling our Government.",m
14357,"Events have proved that I was not wrong in my surmises, and that I had become of importance to the nation's welfare.",m
14358,"As I said, I had placed my little wireless apparatus on what seemed to me a suitable place for receiving messages.",m
14359,That I took every precaution in placing it may be imagined;,m
14360,"I knew from the conversation I had heard between John Liddicoat and the woman who acted with him that I was a suspect, and that they had taken every precaution against me.",m
14361,"I knew, too, if my suspicions were correct, and those suspicions almost amounted to a positive certainty, that I was constantly watched, and that I had, more by chance than by cleverness of my own, kept John Liddicoat in the dark.",m
14362,"It was a little after six o'clock in the evening, as near as I can remember, when I returned to my cottage after having visited my wireless apparatus, and made sure that no messages were being received.",m
14363,I had barely entered my room when Squire Treherne paid me a visit.,m
14364,"I cannot say that I was glad to see him, much as I had grown to like him, for I felt that I was on the eve of great events and was impatient at interruption.",m
14365,"Yet I knew he had not come without reason, and I could not tell him that his visit was untimely.",m
14366,"As I have said before, I treated Simpson more as a friend than as a servant, and while I had not in any degree taken him into my confidence, he knew of, and had become interested in, my little wireless apparatus.",m
14367,"Indeed, he had rejoiced in my hobby, because he believed it took my mind away from unpleasant things.",m
14368,"Moreover, he had proved himself, especially during the past few weeks, an exceedingly sensible fellow, and one who was able to keep his own counsel.",m
14369,"Seeing Squire Treherne, therefore, I told Simpson to station himself in a spot from which he could not be observed, to keep a sharp lookout on my little instrument, and to warn me if any one should come near, and especially to take care that no one should learn of its location.",m
14370,"Having taken this precaution, I went back to Mr. Treherne, who, judging from his countenance, had important things to tell me.",m
14371,"""I hope you are well, Erskine,"" said the old man kindly, at the same time looking anxiously into my face.",m
14372,"""As well as I shall ever be,"" was my reply.",m
14373,"""Do I look ill?""",m
14374,"""No, I can't say you do, but you look strange.",m
14375,"Nothing the matter, I hope?""",m
14376,And again he looked at me anxiously.,m
14377,"""It is good of you to come and see me,"" was my response.",m
14378,"""Not a bit of it!",m
14379,"Not a bit of it!"" and his reply was eager.",m
14380,"""The truth is, I want a chat with you.",m
14381,I have told them at home to put off dinner until eight o'clock in the hope that I may persuade you to come back with me.,m
14382,"I have a trap close by.""",m
14383,I shook my head.,m
14384,"""I am afraid I am not up to it, Squire.",m
14385,"But I hope you have no bad news?""",m
14386,"""Oh no, no bad news at all; quite the other way.",m
14387,"But I say, my lad, I don't like the idea of your being alone here night after night, with only your man to look after you.",m
14388,You really don't look well.,m
14389,"Come and pay me a week's visit, will you?",m
14390,"I feel it would do you good.""",m
14391,"""You are awfully kind, Squire, but do you know I am a good deal of a hermit.",m
14392,"I have come to love this lonely life of mine, and every one is so kind that I don't feel as though I lived amongst strangers.""",m
14393,"""That's right, that's right; but promise me you will come back with me.""",m
14394,"""Not to-night, Squire;",m
14395,"I really can't.""",m
14396,"""Well, then, come over to-morrow.",m
14397,"Come and spend a week with me; we should all love to have you.""",m
14398,"""We will talk about that after I have heard your news,"" I said;",m
14399,"""for I am sure you have news.",m
14400,"What is it?""",m
14401,"""I don't know why I want to tell you, but I feel as though I must.",m
14402,"Josiah Lethbridge has been converted.""",m
14403,"""Converted!",m
14404,"What do you mean?""",m
14405,"""The age of miracles is not past;"" and the Squire laughed as he spoke.",m
14406,"""You know what my opinion of Lethbridge has been; you know, too, that he is regarded as a kind of Shylock.",m
14407,"I told you about our quarrel, didn't I?""",m
14408,"""Yes, I remember perfectly.""",m
14409,"""I hate war;"" and he spoke as though he wanted to change the subject.",m
14410,"""I can't sleep of a night when I think of all the misery, all the agony it is causing.",m
14411,"I know that we as a nation could do nothing but what we have done; but when I remember people like poor Searle, and the hundreds and thousands all over the land whose hearts are broken, I feel like going mad.",m
14412,"It is simply hellish, man!",m
14413,Not that we can stop it.,m
14414,"We must go on and on, no matter what it costs us, until war is made impossible for the future.",m
14415,"No, Kaiserism, militarism must be crushed, destroyed forever!",m
14416,"Still I feel, Erskine, that there is a tremendous alchemy in war.",m
14417,"It is brutal, but it is purifying.",m
14418,"It is hellish, but God uses it, and over-rules it for His own purposes.""",m
14419,"""I hope you are right,"" was my reply.",m
14420,"""But what is your particular reason for saying this now?""",m
14421,"""It is Lethbridge.",m
14422,"You know what a hard man he is, don't you?",m
14423,"You have heard how he has got people into his grip, and ground them to powder?",m
14424,"You have been told how, like a spider, he has attracted them into his web and imprisoned them?",m
14425,"I don't say that, in a way, he has not been a just man.",m
14426,He has never done anything that has violated the law.,m
14427,But he has been cruel and merciless.,m
14428,He has demanded his pound of flesh to the fiftieth part of an ounce.,m
14429,"He has never forgiven an injury, and has always been impatient of any one's will but his own.",m
14430,"But there, I needn't enlarge on that; you have heard, you know.""",m
14431,"""I have heard a good many stories,"" I replied, ""but as a lawyer I always deduct about seventy per cent. from the total.",m
14432,"You see, people are given to exaggerate.""",m
14433,"""Yes, yes, that may be.",m
14434,"But Lethbridge was as hard as nails, as cruel as death; that is why the wonder of it comes to me now.""",m
14435,"""The wonder of what?""",m
14436,I asked.,m
14437,"The Squire hesitated a few seconds, and then went on: ""He got me into his meshes.",m
14438,"Doubtless I was foolish, in fact I know I was.",m
14439,"I speculated, and then, although I was bitten, I speculated again.",m
14440,I don't say Lethbridge encouraged me; but he made me feel that things would be sure to come out right.,m
14441,"They didn't, and I had to mortgage my estate.",m
14442,"I hated going to a bank for money, and Lethbridge helped me out.",m
14443,"Little by little he got the upper hand of me, until--well, for the last few years I have been like a toad under a harrow.",m
14444,You can understand the position.,m
14445,"I never thought I should tell you this, in fact I have always kept my troubles to myself.",m
14446,"All the same, I have been mad at the thought that the estate which has been in my family for I don't know how many generations should be handed over to a man like Lethbridge.""",m
14447,"I was silent, for there seemed nothing to say.",m
14448,"""This morning,"" went on the Squire, ""he came to see me.",m
14449,"At first I met his advances coldly, for although he has had me in his power I have always held up my head.",m
14450,"To my unspeakable astonishment, he came with a proposal which will enable me to be my own man again in five years.",m
14451,"Just think of it, Erskine!",m
14452,"I feel as though an awful weight were lifted from my back.""",m
14453,"""Why did he do it?""",m
14454,I asked.,m
14455,"""That brings me back to what we were talking about.",m
14456,There is some wondrous alchemy in war.,m
14457,"It may debase some, but others it humbles and ennobles.",m
14458,"He said he had had a talk with you, and you had made him feel that his son had died a hero, and was a martyr to his faith.",m
14459,"In short, Hugh's death has changed Lethbridge--shaken him to the very depths of his life--revolutionized him.",m
14460,It seems that he has had further messages about Hugh.,m
14461,"From what I can understand, Hugh gave his life for his enemy.",m
14462,"At the risk of his own life he rescued a German officer, and was killed while he was in the act of doing his glorious deed.",m
14463,"The message does not seem very clear, but that is the meaning of it.",m
14464,"The thing happened in the night-time, and the soldiers who told Hugh's Colonel were not altogether sure of the details, but this they all insist on: young Lethbridge was a hero; he might have saved himself, but wouldn't; he rescued an enemy at the risk of his own life, and then paid the penalty of his action.""",m
14465,I gave a long quivering sigh.,m
14466,I could not help being sad at such a splendid life being cut off in the middle.,m
14467,"""Yes, yes,"" went on the Squire.",m
14468,"""Hugh was a splendid boy.",m
14469,"It seems awful that we shall never see him again--at least, this side of the grave.",m
14470,"But that lad's not dead, Erskine.",m
14471,A boy who could do a deed like that could never die.,m
14472,He had eternal life in him.,m
14473,"Anyhow, Josiah Lethbridge is not the same man.",m
14474,"You should have seen the look of pride, and more than pride, in his eyes as he told me about it.",m
14475,"And what he has done for me, he has done because he says he believes Hugh would have him do it.",m
14476,"'My boy is speaking to me from heaven,' he said;",m
14477,"'that's why I am doing it.'""  The Squire dashed a tear from his eyes as he spoke.",m
14478,"""Would to God I had a son like him!",m
14479,"I tell you, Erskine, I would not have minded losing my estate so much if I knew that he was coming into it.",m
14480,"But there, I have told you what I came to tell you.",m
14481,I thought you would like to know.,m
14482,"It is a miracle, nothing less than a miracle.",m
14483,He has made me ashamed of myself.,m
14484,"Here have I for years been going around thinking hard thoughts and saying hard things about Josiah Lethbridge, and now I feel as though I had been a mean, contemptible sneak.",m
14485,"I have scorned him because he is a Dissenter, I have said hard things about people who are not of my way of thinking.",m
14486,"I say, God Almighty is giving us a shaking up, and showing us what blind fools we have been.",m
14487,"As though He cares what Church we belong to, what place of worship we attend, and what form of prayer we say!",m
14488,"I don't read the Bible much, Erskine, but there is a passage which has been running in my mind all the way over here: 'What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?'",m
14489,"That goes to the heart of things, doesn't it?",m
14490,"All the rest is trimmings, trimmings.",m
14491,"But there, I must be getting back.",m
14492,"Now, won't you come with me?""",m
14493,"""I can't to-night, anyhow,"" I said.",m
14494,"""Well, to-morrow; promise you will come over then.",m
14495,"You will add to my happiness, my boy.",m
14496,"You will really!""",m
14497,The Squire's proposal put a thought into my mind which had not occurred to me before.,m
14498,"I had determined on another plan, but our conversation had suggested a better one.",m
14499,"""I will come over to-morrow for a week, provided I am able, on condition that you do something for me,"" I said.",m
14500,"""Of course I will do anything for you, my boy.",m
14501,"But what is it?""",m
14502,"""Do you know Colonel Laycock?""",m
14503,"""Perfectly well.",m
14504,"I dined at his mess the other night.""",m
14505,"""You are on good terms with him?""",m
14506,"""Of course I am.",m
14507,"Why?""",m
14508,"""I am going to ask you to do a strange thing, Squire,"" I said.",m
14509,"""I have got a scheme in my mind.",m
14510,I am not going to tell you what it is.,m
14511,I am afraid--I am afraid to tell any one.,m
14512,"Why, I don't know; but it is a fact.",m
14513,It is possible that to-night I shall send you a message--possible that I shall ask you to do something which will not appeal to your judgment.,m
14514,But I want you to do it.,m
14515,"Will you?""",m
14516,"""But what is it, my dear fellow?""",m
14517,"""I cannot tell you;",m
14518,I want you to trust me.,m
14519,"I believe big things are moving, and if you will, I am sure you can help me to accomplish what I have in my mind.",m
14520,"If the thing comes off, I will write down detailed instructions, and I want you to act on those instructions.",m
14521,"You are a magistrate, and therefore have considerable authority.""",m
14522,"""Magistrate!"" he said.",m
14523,"""Is it something to do with law, then?""",m
14524,"""It is, and it isn't,"" I said.",m
14525,"""The message may not come to-night, may not come till to-morrow night or the next; but when it comes, I want you to act on it.",m
14526,"Will you?""",m
14527,"""Then will you come and spend a week with me?""",m
14528,"""If I can.""",m
14529,"""I never like acting in the dark, Erskine, but you are a cautious fellow, and I trust you implicitly.",m
14530,"Yes, I will do it; but for the life of me I can't see what you are driving at.""",m
14531,"""Maybe it will end in nothing,"" I said, ""in which case nothing will be done.",m
14532,"But I'll tell you this: if my plans bear fruit, as I think they will, then--then--you will be glad you trusted in me.",m
14533,"I am not asking you to compromise yourself in any way; all the same, I tell you this: it seems to me a matter of life and death.""",m
14534,"For a few seconds the old man looked at me as if he doubted my sanity, then he gripped my hand.",m
14535,"""I trust you completely, Erskine, and I will do what you ask.",m
14536,But I must go now.,m
14537,"Good-night, my boy.",m
14538,"God bless you!""",m
14539,"Directly he had gone I went out to relieve Simpson, and on visiting my wireless apparatus, I found that no message had come through.",m
14540,For the next two hours I was on tenter-hooks.,m
14541,My mind was filled with a thousand doubts.,m
14542,Fears of all sorts haunted me.,m
14543,What if my little apparatus were not powerful enough?,m
14544,What if I had misunderstood the whole situation?,m
14545,Everything seemed shadowy and unreal.,m
14546,"I doubted myself, I doubted everything.",m
14547,That little apparatus which I had prepared to receive messages seemed as valueless as the toy of a child.,m
14548,How could messages move across great spaces and affect the little instrument which I had manipulated with such care?,m
14549,"How could I expect to frustrate the plans of people who were skilled in plotting, and who had been plotting for years?",m
14550,Were not all my hopes and beliefs as baseless as the stuff of which dreams are made?,m
14551,What could a man with the Angel of Death flying over him expect to do under such circumstances?,m
14552,Still I held on to my faith.,m
14553,"Foolish as it might seem, I believed that my reasoning was sound, that I had discovered the truth, and that by carrying out my plans I might save hundreds of lives.",m
14554,"It was now dark; the moon, which was on the wane, would not rise till far past midnight.",m
14555,Although the night was windless it was cloudy.,m
14556,This fact made everything so dark that I did not dread watchful eyes.,m
14557,"Nine o'clock, half-past nine, ten o'clock, yet my little instrument was silent.",m
14558,Had I misunderstood what John Liddicoat had said?,m
14559,Was I mistaken when I heard him tell the woman that he must expect another message the next night?,m
14560,I was in an agony of suspense.,m
14561,"Then my heart gave a great leap--the little instrument began to move, while I, with fast beating heart, wrote quickly.",m
14562,Ten minutes later I had locked myself in my little room and was eagerly studying the slip of paper before me.,m
14563,"I knew that the message, whatever it might be, had emanated from a spot within a comparatively limited radius, for the simple reason that my apparatus was not of sufficient capacity to receive long-distance messages.",m
14564,It is impossible for me to convey on paper the state of my mind as I read the words which had been transmitted.,m
14565,My excitement was tense beyond words.,m
14566,I felt my heart beating wildly;,m
14567,I scarce dared to breathe.,m
14568,And yet the message looked innocent enough.,m
14569,"It was simply this: ""One hour after midnight to-night.",m
14570,"Completeness essential.""",m
14571,That was all; there were no explanations by which any one who was not in the plot could gain any information.,m
14572,"It might be received by a score of wireless stations, and any one ignorant of what I knew would be none the wiser.",m
14573,It gave no clue even to the most subtle mind whereby action could be taken.,m
14574,It might be read by any one with perfect safety.,m
14575,"No Government official, whatever his position, could understand it.",m
14576,Neither would he see any importance in it.,m
14577,"The words were innocence itself, and yet, as I believed, they meant the safety or the destruction of perhaps hundreds of lives.",m
14578,"So innocent did they seem that it appeared like madness to take action, but remembering what I had seen and heard, connecting incident with incident, and placing link to link as I did, my chain of reasoning seemed flawless.",m
14579,"If I were wrong in my conclusions, I should not only be an object of ridicule, I might indeed be placing myself under menace of the law.",m
14580,Still I decided to act.,m
14581,"Rapidly I wrote a letter to Squire Treherne, giving him the minutest details of what I wished him to do.",m
14582,"My brain, I remember, was clear, and I was very careful to insist on all sorts of precautions.",m
14583,"This done, I summoned Simpson to me.",m
14584,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""I want you to take this to Squire Treherne immediately; it is a matter of great importance.",m
14585,It may be that you will be in danger on the way; but that must be risked.,m
14586,You must speak to no one.,m
14587,"Take the footpath through the fields, and don't delay an instant.""",m
14588,"Simpson looked at me steadily as though he doubted my sanity, but evidently there was something in my eyes which told him how much in earnest I was.",m
14589,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir,"" he said, and then he hesitated.",m
14590,"""What is it, Simpson?""",m
14591,"""You will be here all alone, sir.""",m
14592,"""I can't help that;",m
14593,I shall be all right.,m
14594,"Do as I tell you.""",m
14595,"""Shall I find you here when I get back, sir?"" he asked.",m
14596,"""No, Simpson, I was going to mention that.",m
14597,You will not find me here when you get back.,m
14598,"But take no notice of that; wait here until a quarter past one.""",m
14599,"""Quarter past one, sir!",m
14600,"What, an hour and a quarter past midnight?""",m
14601,"""Wait here until a quarter past one,"" I repeated, ""and then, if I do not appear, make your way down to the copse, by the footpath, to the beach.",m
14602,"You know the cave which is almost immediately beneath the house; go straight to the mouth of the cave and look for me.""",m
14603,"Again Simpson looked at me as though he doubted my sanity, but, like the well-bred servant he was, he made no reply but ""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
14604,A minute later I heard Simpson leaving the house.,m
14605,I felt that the air was laden with tragic events.,m
14606,"It was now past eleven o'clock, and I had two hours in which to wait, but I could not stay indoors.",m
14607,"Strange as it may seem, I felt no weakness, while the malady from which I suffered gave me no pain at all.",m
14608,"I was still buoyed up by the same strange, unnatural strength.",m
14609,"I crept towards my little wireless apparatus, but there was no further message.",m
14610,"I remained in the near distance for some time, waiting and watching; once or twice I thought I heard a rustling among the bushes, but I was not sure.",m
14611,"Although I had no reason for my suspicion, I believed that some one was near me, that furtive eyes were watching me; but I had no tangible reason for believing this.",m
14612,At midnight I went back to the house again;,m
14613,Simpson had not returned.,m
14614,"The little dog I had rescued a few days before came and sniffed at my feet, wagging his tail as he did so.",m
14615,Evidently the poor little wretch was rapidly recovering from his wound; indeed he seemed quite well.,m
14616,I put on an overcoat and prepared to go out.,m
14617,"The dog still wagged his tail, as though he thought he was going to accompany me.",m
14618,"""No,"" I said to him, ""you must not come.""",m
14619,Whereupon he began to whimper piteously.,m
14620,"I left the house, locking the door, but I had not gone more than a few steps before I stopped.",m
14621,The dog had begun to howl.,m
14622,"""This will never do,"" I reflected.",m
14623,"""I will let him come with me, he can do no harm.""",m
14624,"I opened the door again, whereupon the little brute rushed to me and capered with joy.",m
14625,"""Be quiet,"" I said.",m
14626,"""If you follow me you must make no noise.""",m
14627,"He seemed to understand, for he followed closely at my heels, making no sound as I carefully made my way through the undergrowth.",m
14628,"When I had passed through the copse I stopped and listened; at first I thought I heard a rustling sound behind me, but evidently I was mistaken, for all was as silent as death.",m
14629,"The night was still dark, although here and there between the clouds I saw stars twinkling; not a breath of wind stirred, and no sound reached me save the soughing of the waves.",m
14630,Some miles out at sea I saw the revolving light of the Dead Man's Rock Lighthouse.,m
14631,"My descent to the beach was precipitous and somewhat dangerous, but I knew the pathway, and noiselessly made my way down, the dog keeping close to me all the time.",m
14632,"A few minutes later I had reached the beach, and again I listened.",m
14633,My eyes had become sufficiently accustomed to the darkness to see that the dog was also listening.,m
14634,"Once or twice he gave a slight whimper, but at a whispered command he was silent.",m
14635,I found my way to the shelter of a rock close to the fissure by which the outer cave was entered.,m
14636,"Creeping into the hollow of the rock, I took a little electric lamp from my pocket, and in its light saw that it was nearly half-past twelve.",m
14637,Minutes at that time seemed to me an eternity.,m
14638,"Again I passed through all sorts of doubt, and more than once called myself a madman who had followed a will-o'-the-wisp of a wild fancy.",m
14639,Still I held fast to my resolution.,m
14640,From my hiding-place I could see the fissure which led to the cave.,m
14641,At least it would be difficult for any one to approach it without my seeing him.,m
14642,All the time the little dog sat close by my side with eyes and ears alert.,m
14643,I think he understood the condition of my mind.,m
14644,"Minute after minute passed slowly by, and there was neither sound nor sight that gave me warning of any one's approach.",m
14645,"I looked anxiously to the right and to the left, seeking in vain to pierce the darkness of the night; but nothing happened;",m
14646,I was alone and in silence.,m
14647,"I think I must have fallen into a kind of waking dream, for, as it seemed to me, some moments passed when I had no consciousness of my surroundings.",m
14648,Then suddenly the dog at my feet gave a savage yelp.,m
14649,"It was well he did so, for I saw two forms close by me, both of which seemed to be in the act of pouncing upon me.",m
14650,"I have read somewhere of a man who, when facing a great crisis, felt that he lived a lifetime in a few seconds.",m
14651,I realized now that this can be true.,m
14652,"Within a few seconds of the time when the dog yelped, the whole panorama of the past twelve months, and all the details of that panorama, flashed before my eyes.",m
14653,It came to me with a vividness which I had never realized before.,m
14654,"That I was indeed at the heart of a scheme whereon depended the lives of many people; that these tins of petrol were intended for German submarines; that this little cove had been used as a storehouse for the fuel whereby the Germans had been able to do their fiendish work; that in some way unknown to the authorities, hundreds of cans of this spirit had been stored there from time to time, and then, as they were needed, taken to those deadly monsters which operated beneath the sea; and that I had, partly by chance, partly by reasoning, but more by intuition, got at the heart of it all.",m
14655,"I felt, too, that on me depended the failure or success of the German scheme.",m
14656,"By some means or other Liddicoat, or one of his minions, had discovered or suspected what I had done.",m
14657,"It was one of those moments, so tense, so weighted with vital issues, that the human body and the human mind are made capable of what in ordinary circumstances would be impossible.",m
14658,"Without waiting a second, without giving time to think, and yet feeling all the while that I was acting upon reason rather than upon impulse, I leapt upon what seemed to me the form of a man, and was instantly engaged in a deadly struggle.",m
14659,Even now that struggle does not seem to me real.,m
14660,It is like the memory of a dream rather than something which actually took place.,m
14661,But that it did take place I have tremendous proof.,m
14662,"I do not remember making any noise of any sort, but I do remember the deathly grip which was laid upon me and the fight which I knew was to the death.",m
14663,"I cannot explain why, but life never was so dear to me as at that moment.",m
14664,"I felt, too, as though Dr. Rhomboid had been somehow mistaken in his diagnosis; that life was strong in me, but that passion was swallowed up in a greater passion, a nobler passion--it was to render service to my country, to save the lives of my fellow-countrymen.",m
14665,Even while I struggled I saw what the success of my plans meant; what their failure meant.,m
14666,"I remember, too, that I wondered why the second person I had seen took no part in the struggle; why, although there were two who prepared to attack me, only one fought me.",m
14667,Yet such was the case; it was man to man.,m
14668,"Who the man was I was not sure, although I had a dim consciousness that I was fighting with the man Liddicoat; neither had I any clear conception as to the meaning of that deadly struggle; all the same, I knew that I must struggle till I had mastered him.",m
14669,I did not remember the precautions I had taken or the agencies I had set on foot; everything was swallowed up in the one thought--I must master the man who I was sure meant to kill me.,m
14670,"How long the encounter lasted I have not the remotest idea; indeed, as I think of it now, I was robbed of all human personality.",m
14671,"I was simply Fate, and as Fate I must accomplish my purpose, heedless of everything.",m
14672,"I fancied that I was gaining the upper hand of him; fancied, too, that others were coming upon the scene of action; but of this I was not sure, for a great darkness came upon me suddenly, and I knew nothing more.",m
14673,XXVII  VISION   And now I have come to that part of my experiences which I find difficult to relate.,m
14674,"It is probable that if these lines are read by eyes other than my own, they will be disbelieved, yet I will set them down as I remember them.",m
14675,"This is no easy matter, for I feel as though I were recalling the incidents which happened in a far-off dream rather than something which actually took place.",m
14676,And yet not altogether.,m
14677,"What I am going to tell is very real to me, even although the reality is utterly different from what I ever experienced before.",m
14678,"Even as I remember, I find myself thinking out of ordinary grooves, and my thoughts are of such a nature that I find no language sufficient to express them.",m
14679,I was dead.,m
14680,"I knew that my spirit, my essential self, had left my body, and that I was no longer a habitant of the world in which I had lived.",m
14681,"My first sensation, for I can find no better word to express my thought, was that of freedom, and with that sense of freedom came a consciousness of utter loneliness.",m
14682,"I felt as the Ancient Mariner in Coleridge's immortal poem must have felt:      ""Alone, alone, all alone,     Alone on a wild, wide sea,     So lonely it was that God Himself,     Scarce seemed there to be.""",m
14683,"I felt no pain, no weariness, and I was free; but I was alone.",m
14684,I do not know that I felt fear; no terror possessed me;,m
14685,"I did not think of my past life with dread, neither did past scenes haunt me.",m
14686,"My thought of the past was rather the thought of emptiness, of purposelessness, of vacancy; it seemed to me as though my life had been a great opportunity of which I had failed to avail myself.",m
14687,"I had a feeling, too, that it was very cold.",m
14688,"I seemed to be floating in infinite space, through sunless air.",m
14689,"Kipling, I remember, in one of the most vivid poems he ever wrote, described a man who, when he died, was carried far away:      ""Till he heard as the roar of a rain-fed ford, the roar of the         Milky Way.",m
14690,"Till he heard  the roar of the Milky Way die down, and drone and         cease....",m
14691,"Then Tomlinson looked up and down, and little gain was there For the naked stars gleamed overhead, and he saw that his soul was bare.",m
14692,"But the wind that blows between the worlds had cut him like a knife....""",m
14693,But the poet's imagination never saw in his vision an experience like mine.,m
14694,No winds blew between the worlds; there was no roar as of a rain-fed ford; all was silence.,m
14695,"Not the silence of narrow spaces, not even the silence of night, when the ears of listeners are filled with noise made by silence; it was the silence of illimitable spaces, the silence of eternity.",m
14696,I thought my spirit was mounting; at least that was the impression left upon me;,m
14697,"I was going upward, not downward.",m
14698,"But here words fail me again, because, as it seemed to me, there was no upward and no downward.",m
14699,"More than that, there seemed to be a lack of standards whereby one could measure anything.",m
14700,"There was no more time, and as a consequence there was no past, no present, no future.",m
14701,"Everything, as I thought, was formless, meaningless.",m
14702,I know I have failed to give a true idea of what I saw and felt.,m
14703,"As a boy, I was for a short time fascinated by the study of astronomy, and I remember being made afraid by the thought of the distances between the worlds.",m
14704,Now all that was changed;,m
14705,"I was floating, it appeared to me, between unnumbered worlds, but in a way they were near to me, so near that I could see what was happening on them.",m
14706,"How long I was alone I do not know, for, as I have said, time had no meaning.",m
14707,"In a sense I felt as though I wandered through the silences for aeons, although scenes flashed before me with the speed of light.",m
14708,"My experiences make me think of the words of the old Hebrew poet:      ""A thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday,     when it is passed, and as a watch in the night.""",m
14709,"I have said that the worlds I saw were near me, so near that I could see their inhabitants and watch their movements and activities.",m
14710,"But even in this I convey a wrong impression, for while I had this sense of nearness, I had also the consciousness that they were separated by vast distances.",m
14711,It was just as though I had a glimpse of the Universe.,m
14712,"There were millions of worlds around me, and all were inhabited; everywhere was life, life that expressed itself in thought and action.",m
14713,On every hand were sentient thinking beings who played their part and did their work in the world from which they drew their life.,m
14714,A sense of unutterable awe possessed me.,m
14715,I was between the worlds.,m
14716,"I could watch what was being done on those worlds, and I felt myself to be the merest speck in infinity.",m
14717,"As I have stated, the thought which possessed me was that I was utterly alone, and that while I suffered no pain, and while I had a consciousness of freedom which made me exultant, my loneliness was beyond all thought....",m
14718,I felt a presence; at least that is the only word I can think of to express my thought.,m
14719,"I had no consciousness of a person being near me, and yet that Something was all around me, an Intelligence, a Will, a Power.",m
14720,"What it was I could not tell, but that Something answered the questions which came to me....",m
14721,The one predominating thought or consciousness which flooded and overwhelmed everything was the consciousness of God.,m
14722,"While I had been in the body, something hid from me the reality of God; now everything was God.",m
14723,"I lived in God; everything was submerged in this one great Fact of Facts, and I wondered at my blindness when I was alive.",m
14724,"And yet I was overwhelmed by what, for want of a better word, I call the immensity of everything.",m
14725,"I remember asking myself how God could care for such a life as mine; how He could take an interest in the myriads of beings who inhabited the worlds; how He, Who controlled planets and suns, could care for the little lives of men.",m
14726,For I seemed so infinitely little;,m
14727,"I was but a speck in infinite space, less to the Universe than the tiniest insect which crawled upon the face of the globe on which I had lived.",m
14728,"But even as the thought came to me came also the answer: because God was infinite in thought, in love, in power, so His Being enveloped all; that because He governed the infinitely Great, so He cared for the tiniest speck of life He had created....",m
14729,I saw the world from which I had come;,m
14730,I was able to locate my own country.,m
14731,"Europe stretched out before me like a plain, and there I saw the nations at war.",m
14732,"At first the war appeared only like the struggle of ants upon their little hills, and it seemed of no more importance as to which army should conquer the other than if they had been so many insects at war.",m
14733,"""How little we must be to God!""",m
14734,I thought.,m
14735,"""On earth we regarded the European War as something beyond all thought, all comprehension, yet seen from here it is less than a struggle of gnats.",m
14736,"What does it matter to God whether England or Germany wins in what we call the Great World Struggle?""",m
14737,"But even as the thought flashed through my spirit came the answer that God did care; that because we were the breath of His life we had a destiny to fulfil, a work to do; that the energies of God were on the side of those who sought to express His will.",m
14738,It was all infinitely beyond me;,m
14739,"I could not understand, and yet I had the consciousness that God watched the struggle of the creatures He had made, and that He was on the side of those who, perhaps unknown to themselves, were moving towards His own purposes.",m
14740,"As I watched, the world seemed to become nearer to me, and such was my power of vision that I was able to visualize all the struggle and all the deadly warfare from Russia to France.",m
14741,"I heard the boom of guns, I saw the flash of bayonets, I could plainly see the men in their trenches and could hear them talking with each other.",m
14742,"I saw shells flying from the mouths of the guns, I watched their passage through the air.",m
14743,"I beheld them as they fell, and I saw the stain on the battle-fields.",m
14744,I realized everything as I had never realized it before.,m
14745,"I saw men in their death agony, I heard their groans, their shrieks of pain.",m
14746,"I saw thousands of torn, mangled bodies, bodies which a moment before were full of life and vigor.",m
14747,"Then, as it seemed to me, I beheld the agony of the world.",m
14748,"I saw blighted homes, broken lives, bleeding, broken hearts.",m
14749,"""O God!""",m
14750,"I cried out, ""let me not see!",m
14751,"I cannot bear it!""",m
14752,"For death was horrible to me, and life a mockery.",m
14753,"How could God care when He allowed these young lives, so full of hope and promise, to perish in a moment?",m
14754,"Then out of all the mad carnage and above the din and horror of war came a voice that filled my being and rang through the worlds:  ""Fear not them who can kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.""",m
14755,"I saw that the great tragedy of the world was not the tragedy caused by war, but the tragedy of men killing their souls even while their bodies lived; that the death of those on the battle-fields was as nothing compared to the death of those who seemed to live and yet who were dead, because they had sacrificed truth and honor and love, and that death was impossible while honor and truth and love lived.",m
14756,"Then I looked again, and behold, the heavens were full of the spirits of those who had offered their all on the altar of duty, and that for them there was no death.",m
14757,"I saw that instruments of war had no power to touch the real life of these men; that each had a Divine Spark of life, and that that life was still under the overshadowing wing of the Eternal love....",m
14758,"Ages appeared to pass; how long I knew not, cared not, for time had no meaning.",m
14759,"I saw that the Eternal Love and the Eternal Life, which was everywhere, was bringing out of all that at first seemed a meaningless chaos an infinite order; that even the War of the World in which men lost their lives by thousands and hundreds of thousands, in which unholy passions seemed to prevail, and in which Death stalked triumphant: I say I saw evolving out of all this, confused and contradictory as it all appeared, a higher life and a higher thought--a movement towards the Eternal Will and towards the Eternal Purpose which was behind everything.",m
14760,"I know I have badly expressed all this, because I find no words wherewith to make clear that which came to me; for in truth thought was lost in consciousness, and language fails to express that consciousness.",m
14761,"I only know that I saw order coming out of chaos, light out of darkness, love out of hatred, divinity out of bestiality, life out of death.",m
14762,For life and love were all.,m
14763,"I did not see God--that is, I was not able to visualize His Presence.",m
14764,"I did not talk with God as a man talketh with his friend, and yet my whole being seemed to be filled with His Light and Love and Peace.",m
14765,"I felt that I was breathing God, because God was all; that nothing was outside His Care, that nothing was too small for His Love.",m
14766,"I wondered at my doubts and at my absence of faith, for God was everywhere, in everything; in all purposes, plans, desires.",m
14767,"I was conscious that He was shaping and directing and controlling all the thoughts of men, and that everything was moving towards His Eternal Purposes.",m
14768,"In the light of what I saw, pain and wrong and misery were being overruled by the Eternal Love, so that even they were speeding men towards the greater, fuller life, and that in the march of untold ages Life and Love were everything.",m
14769,"A sense of triumph, of exultation filled me, bore me up as if on the wings of eagles.",m
14770,I saw everything from a new perspective.,m
14771,"I realized as I never realized before the meaning of the words of the Apostle:  ""Our light affliction, which is but for a _moment_, worketh for us a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of glory.""",m
14772,"I saw that all things--all wrong, all pain, all darkness, everything which made life dark and terrible--were only for a _moment_, and that they were overruled by the Eternal God, so that those who suffered them merged through the ages into Eternal Love and Eternal Light.",m
14773,"How long I was in this state I do not know, for, as I have said, time had no meaning to me.",m
14774,All life's standards seemed to melt away.,m
14775,"I only knew that I was, that I felt, that I was filled with an overwhelming joy, because I knew that darkness would end in Eternal Light, that pain would end in Infinite Peace.",m
14776,Then slowly everything began to fade away; the worlds by which I was surrounded ceased to be.,m
14777,"I lost the power, of visualizing; my thoughts became dim and indistinct.",m
14778,Presently all became darkness save for one speck of light.,m
14779,"Sometimes that speck of light became very small; sometimes it grew larger, but it was always there, and I was conscious of an unspeakable peace.",m
14780,XXVIII  THE NEW LIFE   The first thing I can remember after coming to consciousness was the feeling that strangers were around me.,m
14781,"I could not see them, but I knew they were there.",m
14782,"I remember trying to open my eyes, but I could see nothing;",m
14783,"I heard whispered voices, however.",m
14784,"""Is he dead?""",m
14785,"""I am not quite sure.",m
14786,"No, he's not dead, his pulse still beats!""",m
14787,"""Will he live, do you think?""",m
14788,"""Difficult to say.",m
14789,"He came out of it all right, but his vitality is very low.""",m
14790,"""Was the operation severe?""",m
14791,"""Yes, very severe; it is a miracle that he has lived as long as he has.",m
14792,"I must go by the Riviera express to-morrow morning, but I will call about eight o'clock.""",m
14793,"""Have you any further orders to give?""",m
14794,"""No, you can only do what I have told you.",m
14795,"His life hangs on a thread; he may live, but I doubt it.""",m
14796,"I listened in a detached kind of way, scarcely realizing what I heard;",m
14797,"I was perfectly indifferent, too.",m
14798,"It had nothing to do with me, and even if it had, I did not care.",m
14799,Then darkness came upon me again and I no longer saw the bright speck shining.,m
14800,After that I had quickly fleeting moments of consciousness; things around me became real for a moment and then passed away.,m
14801,"Doubtless I was in a semi-comatose condition; sometimes I imagined I heard fragments of conversation, but I can remember nothing definite.",m
14802,After that followed a time of intense weariness.,m
14803,I felt as though I were too weak even to lie down;,m
14804,"I could not move my limbs, and the weight of my own body on the bed seemed to weary me, but I was not sufficiently conscious to realize the full extent of my weariness.",m
14805,I have a vague remembrance of being fed;,m
14806,I call to mind a woman standing by my bedside holding something to my mouth; but as I reflect now these things seem only phantoms of the mind.,m
14807,"After a time I became conscious of intense pain, and I have a recollection of being able to move my limbs, and I remember hearing a voice saying:  ""He is stronger anyhow, but I never saw a man so utterly exhausted.""",m
14808,"A long space of time, how long I do not know, but it seemed to me interminable.",m
14809,"Day appeared to follow day and week to follow week, and yet I have no distinct remembrance.",m
14810,"In recalling it all, I am like a man trying to remember a far-off dream.",m
14811,Suddenly I became awake.,m
14812,I was fully conscious that I was living;,m
14813,"I could outline the room in which I lay, I could see the sunlight streaming in at the window, I could hear the birds singing.",m
14814,"I was very weak, but I was alive;",m
14815,"I was able to think, too, able to connect thought with thought, although my memory was dim.",m
14816,Incidents of my life passed before me like shadows;,m
14817,"I saw them only in part, but I did see them.",m
14818,The room was strange to me.,m
14819,This was not my little bedroom by the sea; the apartment was bigger than the whole of my cottage.,m
14820,"The ceiling was high, and the window through which the sun shone was large.",m
14821,"I did not care so much where I was; all the same, I was curious.",m
14822,"""What has happened to me, I wonder?""",m
14823,"I asked myself, ""and why am I here?""",m
14824,"I could see no one in the room, and all was silent save for the singing of the birds and the humming of the insects.",m
14825,"I had a vague consciousness that the feeling of summer was in the air, and a delicious kind of restfulness possessed me.",m
14826,"I was no longer too tired to lie down, rather I felt the luxury of being in bed.",m
14827,"I suffered no pain either, although at my side, where I remembered suffering exquisite agony, was a kind of tingling sensation which I associated with a wound in the act of healing.",m
14828,"I saw a woman come to the head of my bed; she wore a nurse's uniform, and had a placid, kindly face.",m
14829,"""Who are you, and where am I?""",m
14830,"I know I spoke the words, but I did not recognize my voice at all; it seemed far away, like a whispering among breezes.",m
14831,"The woman said something, I know, but what, I could not tell.",m
14832,"I imagine the effect was soothing, for immediately afterwards I found myself going to sleep.",m
14833,"Again I was conscious, more vividly conscious than before.",m
14834,"The outlines of the room were the same, and I was able to recognize some of the furniture which I had previously seen.",m
14835,"I remembered, too, lifting my hand from the counterpane and noting how thin and white it was.",m
14836,The door of the room opened and a man entered.,m
14837,"I saw at a glance that it was Simpson, and I looked at him through my half-closed eyes.",m
14838,"He came to my bedside and looked steadily at me, then he placed his hand gently on my forehead; his touch was as soft as that of a woman.",m
14839,"""Simpson,"" I said, and this time I was able to recognize my voice.",m
14840,"""Is that you, Simpson?""",m
14841,"""Yes, sir; thank you, sir.""",m
14842,His old-time formula acted on me like a tonic; it made me want to laugh.,m
14843,"Yes, I really was alive then, and Simpson was with me; but what was the meaning of this strange room?",m
14844,"""Simpson,"" I said, ""am I really alive?""",m
14845,"""Yes, sir; thank God, sir.""",m
14846,"I thought I saw the tears gather in his eyes, and I am sure I saw his lips tremble.",m
14847,"""Have I been ill, Simpson?""",m
14848,"""Yes, sir, very ill, but I believe we have beaten them, sir.""",m
14849,"""Beaten who?""",m
14850,I asked.,m
14851,But this time he did not answer.,m
14852,The woman came in again bearing something in her hand.,m
14853,"There was a whispered consultation between them, and then I remember drinking something, after which I went to sleep again.",m
14854,When I again awoke I felt sure it was morning.,m
14855,"I had no reason for believing this, but I had no doubt about it; the air was morning air, the sounds were morning sounds.",m
14856,"The birds were chirping in the trees, the cattle were lowing in the meadows, the poultry were cackling in a yard near by, a thousand whispering voices everywhere told me that I had awakened to the dawn of a new day.",m
14857,"I moved in my bed; yes, I had strength enough for that, and the movement caused me no pain.",m
14858,"In an instant I heard footsteps, and Simpson again came to my side.",m
14859,"""Can I do anything for you, sir?",m
14860,"How are you to-day?""",m
14861,"""I feel like a man reborn, Simpson,"" I said.",m
14862,And it was true.,m
14863,A life was surging in my veins which I never remembered before;,m
14864,I felt as though my whole being had been made clean and all my powers renewed.,m
14865,"I was unutterably weak, but I felt all a child's health and joy.",m
14866,"""Tell me what this means, Simpson,"" I said;",m
14867,"""this is not my room, not my bed.""",m
14868,"""No, sir, but I am your man, sir,"" and his voice was husky.",m
14869,"""Yes, I am glad you are with me, Simpson.",m
14870,"It is good to wake up and find you here.""",m
14871,"""I hope I shall never have to leave you, sir,"" and I saw him wipe away his tears.",m
14872,"""Tell me about it, Simpson--tell me where I am and what has happened to me.""",m
14873,"""I am forbidden to talk, sir; the doctor won't allow me.",m
14874,"You see----""  ""What doctor?""",m
14875,I interrupted.,m
14876,"""Dr. Rhomboid, sir.""",m
14877,"""Dr. Rhomboid?",m
14878,"Dr. Rhomboid?""",m
14879,The name was familiar to me.,m
14880,"""Where am I, Simpson?""",m
14881,"""You are at Trecarrel, sir;",m
14882,"Miss Lethbridge insisted on----""  ""Miss Lethbridge!",m
14883,"Miss Lethbridge!""",m
14884,Then like a flash the veil dropped from my memory.,m
14885,"I called to mind the struggle on the beach, the hand-to-hand fight, the plot which I had determined to expose.",m
14886,"""Miss Lethbridge insisted on my being brought here, did she, Simpson?""",m
14887,"""Yes, sir; you see, sir, that man Liddicoat struck you with something heavy.",m
14888,"I--I--but there, I mustn't tell you.""",m
14889,"""Yes, you must, Simpson;",m
14890,I insist upon knowing everything.,m
14891,"I remember all that happened now: I was leaning against the rock waiting, when the dog barked, and the man Liddicoat sprang upon me.",m
14892,"I struggled with him for a long time, and then suddenly everything became dark.""",m
14893,"""Yes, sir, after they had finished----""  ""Finished what?""",m
14894,I asked.,m
14895,"""I can't tell you now, sir; but Miss Lethbridge insisted on your being brought here.",m
14896,"And really, sir, the road is easier here than it is to our house, and I gave in.""",m
14897,"""But how did Miss Lethbridge get there?""",m
14898,"""I don't know, sir.",m
14899,I expect she will be telling you herself as soon as you are strong enough.,m
14900,"Then I insisted upon sending for Dr. Rhomboid, and, sir, as Providence would have it, he was staying at the Tolgarrick Manor Hotel.",m
14901,"The Squire had heard of it, sir; that was why, as soon as you were brought here....""",m
14902,"I felt that my mind was weakening, and that I had no longer any strength to grasp the things which Simpson was saying.",m
14903,"I lost interest in them, too, and I remember falling asleep with the thought in my mind that I was in the house where Isabella Lethbridge had insisted upon bringing me.",m
14904,"I awoke again, and I knew that I was stronger; everything was outlined more clearly to me.",m
14905,"Not only the objects by which I was surrounded, but my thoughts seemed more definite.",m
14906,"It was now night; the room in which I lay was only illumined by a candle, but I saw everything plainly.",m
14907,Sitting by my side was the nurse whom I remembered previously; she started up on hearing me move and looked at me anxiously.,m
14908,"""You need not fear, nurse,"" I said.",m
14909,"""I am better; the cobwebs have gone.""",m
14910,"The nurse smiled, then she placed her hand upon my wrist.",m
14911,"""Yes,"" she said, ""you are better, stronger.",m
14912,"Can you bear to have this in your mouth a minute?""",m
14913,"""I can bear anything, nurse.""",m
14914,"Evidently she was pleased with me, for a minute later she smiled confidently.",m
14915,"""Your pulse is normal and you have no fever,"" she said.",m
14916,"""Why am I here, nurse?",m
14917,What has happened to me?,m
14918,"Tell me everything.""",m
14919,"""No, no; go to sleep now, and in the morning you may be strong enough to bear it.""",m
14920,"""I should sleep far better if I knew everything,"" I replied;",m
14921,"""don't be foolish, nurse.""",m
14922,"""What do you want to know?""",m
14923,"""Dr. Rhomboid has been here, I am told,"" I said.",m
14924,"""What did he say about me?",m
14925,"When I saw him in London he wrote my death-warrant.""",m
14926,"""Now he has given you a reprieve,"" was her reply, ""and more than a reprieve.",m
14927,"In fact, he said that if you got through the operation you would live!""",m
14928,I was not surprised;,m
14929,"I felt that life, and not death, was surging within me.",m
14930,"""Don't try to keep things back from me, nurse,"" I said.",m
14931,"""I remember everything that took place.",m
14932,I remember the struggle on the beach and the darkness which followed.,m
14933,"Simpson tells me that I have been brought to Mr. Lethbridge's house, and that, as if by special Providence, Dr. Rhomboid was staying at the Tolgarrick Hotel.",m
14934,"What was his verdict?""",m
14935,"""He sent for a London surgeon,"" said the nurse, ""and he told us that if you recovered from the operation you would live.",m
14936,"You have recovered.""",m
14937,"""Then he made a wrong diagnosis in London.",m
14938,"That means I had something growing in me, and now it's cut out I shall live?""",m
14939,The nurse nodded and smiled.,m
14940,"""That's all I must tell you now,"" she said;",m
14941,"""take this and go to sleep.""",m
14942,"I obeyed her like a child; a feeling of utter contentment possessed me, and I felt myself dropping into a deep, untroubled sleep.",m
14943,When I awoke again I had a feeling that it was morning.,m
14944,"I knew that the dewdrops were shining on the grass, that the day was new-born;",m
14945,"I knew, too, that the sun was rising in a cloudless sky, that the time was summer.",m
14946,"I was in the same room, but somehow it was different.",m
14947,A new atmosphere pervaded it;,m
14948,"I saw vases of flowers, flowers that were wet with the morning dew, flowers that had been gathered that morning.",m
14949,Their perfume was as sweet as the spices of Araby.,m
14950,A feeling of delicious restfulness possessed me;,m
14951,"I was as weak as a child; but there was new life in my being, a life that would overcome everything.",m
14952,"I closed my eyes with the consciousness that all was well; nothing troubled me, no thought of care weighed upon my brain or heart.",m
14953,"I caught myself remembering those lines of Browning:      ""The lark's on the wing,     The morning's at seven,     The hillside's dew-pearled,     The snail's on the thorn;",m
14954,"God's in His heaven,     All's right with the world!""",m
14955,I heard a sob close by my side.,m
14956,"I did not know how it was, but the sob seemed to be in accord with my thoughts, for it contained no sorrow.",m
14957,I opened my eyes and saw Isabella Lethbridge leaning over my bed.,m
14958,"I didn't speak, I couldn't; my life was filled with wonder, a wonder which I cannot put into words.",m
14959,"She was dressed, I remember, all in white; this I thought strange, because I imagined she would show some kind of mourning for her dead brother; but I gave it only a passing thought, for it was of no importance; the thing that impressed me was the new light in her eyes, the new joy in her face.",m
14960,"The barrier which had always stood between us had melted away; she was transformed, glorified.",m
14961,"There was no need to tell me that a wondrous change had come over her; that some joy to which she had hitherto been blind possessed her; that a new power was pulsating in her life: Isabella Lethbridge was transformed, beautified beyond all thought.",m
14962,We looked at each other without speaking a word; there was no need for words; words at that moment would have seemed like sacrilege.,m
14963,"A thousand questions flashed through my mind, but I did not ask them; there was only one question which I longed to ask, a question which embraced everything.",m
14964,"Still we did not speak; we remained looking in each other's eyes, as if each were trying to find what we looked for.",m
14965,"Then I saw the tears well up, saw them trickle down her cheeks, saw her lips quiver, and then she could no longer hold back her words.",m
14966,"""Don't you know, don't you know?"" she sobbed.",m
14967,"I held out my arms, and a second later our lips met, and we were uttering incoherent words which none but those who know the language of the heart can interpret.",m
14968,"""You know now, don't you?"" she said at length.",m
14969,"""Yes, I know,"" I said.",m
14970,And yet it was all a wonder to me.,m
14971,When last I had spoken to her an invisible barrier stood between us.,m
14972,"I had admired her beauty, her keen intelligence;",m
14973,"I thought, too, that I saw wondrous possibilities in her nature; but I did not love her.",m
14974,"Something, I knew not what, forbade that love.",m
14975,"I had told her so, told her that I did not love her, that I only loved the woman she ought to be.",m
14976,Now it seemed as though a magician's hand had swept away the barrier; that some divine power had illumined her life and filled it with a new and divine element.,m
14977,"I saw her ennobled, glorified; the old repellent look had gone; those eyes which had flashed with scorn were now filled with infinite tenderness.",m
14978,Why was it?,m
14979,And what had wrought the change?,m
14980,"Presently she lifted her head, and I saw a look of fear come into her eyes.",m
14981,"""You said you didn't love me; is that true?""",m
14982,"""You know,"" I replied.",m
14983,"""But tell me, tell me!""",m
14984,"""I can't,"" I replied;",m
14985,"""words only mock me; they would only suggest the faintest shadow of what fills my life.",m
14986,The barriers are gone!,m
14987,"What has wrought the change?""",m
14988,"""Are you sure you are strong enough to hear?",m
14989,"Oh, it is wrong of me to speak to you like this, and you so weak!""",m
14990,"""Your every word is giving me new life,"" was my reply;",m
14991,"""tell me everything.""",m
14992,"""And you are sure, sure--that--that----""  ""That I see in you the woman God meant you to be,"" was my reply.",m
14993,"""But what has wrought the change?""",m
14994,"""I can hardly find words to tell you, it seems so unreal, so--so beyond the power of words to express.",m
14995,But--but years ago I could not love;,m
14996,"I longed to love and could not; something held me back, what, I didn't know.",m
14997,I tried to break down that something.,m
14998,"I--I was called a flirt, you know,"" and she laughed nervously.",m
14999,"""Yes, yes, I remember,"" I said.",m
15000,"""I did it as an experiment.",m
15001,"I fancied that somehow if I won the love of some one, the casement around my heart would break, would melt away; but it was no use.",m
15002,And all the time I knew that I was missing the joy of life.,m
15003,Then you came.,m
15004,"Yes, you were right;",m
15005,"I thought I saw in you one who might break the hard crust around my heart, and I tried to fascinate you, tried to--to--do what you said.",m
15006,"You remember?""",m
15007,"""Yes, I remember.""",m
15008,"""But you were right.",m
15009,"If you had loved me then, I had nothing to give you.",m
15010,At the centre of my heart there was a burning fire; but that fire was confined;,m
15011,I didn't love you;,m
15012,"I wanted to, longed to, but I could not.",m
15013,"And yet all the time I knew that if ever love came to me it would be for you, only you.""",m
15014,"She ceased speaking for a few seconds, and I heard her tremulous breathing.",m
15015,"""Do you understand?",m
15016,"Do you forgive me?"" she asked.",m
15017,"""Yes, I understand; go on, tell me.""",m
15018,"""Then came that day, before--before--the awful night.",m
15019,"You know when you told me that you believed you were going to die, and you hinted that that very night you were going on an enterprise which meant danger, possibly death, I think I went mad;",m
15020,"I have no remembrance of anything except the feeling that I must watch you, save you!",m
15021,So all that evening I waited around your hut unseen.,m
15022,I saw you at your little wireless station;,m
15023,I saw you send Simpson away;,m
15024,I saw you go down through the copse towards the beach.,m
15025,"I followed you, watching all the time.",m
15026,Even then I didn't know my secret;,m
15027,"I acted as though I had no will of my own, as though I were driven by some power I could not understand.",m
15028,"I didn't know your plans, but I felt that I must be silent and watch.",m
15029,"Then when that man leapt on you something seemed to break within me, something was liberated, I didn't know what; but I knew that I loved you, I knew that the power of love had come to me, and that I was ready to die to save you.",m
15030,"Without thought or comprehension of what I was doing, I flung myself upon the woman, and--and....""",m
15031,"""Oh, my love, my love!""",m
15032,I murmured.,m
15033,"""Thank God for all His goodness!""",m
15034,For some time we were silent.,m
15035,"""Tell me all the rest,"" I said presently.",m
15036,"""That's all, isn't it?""",m
15037,"There was a great deal more, but I cared nothing about it.",m
15038,"At that moment it seemed to me that all I had tried to do and hoped to do for my country was swallowed up in the one great possession, the one great fact which overwhelmed everything.",m
15039,"""Am I doing wrong in telling you this?"" she asked.",m
15040,"""It seems as though there is nothing else in life now but that, because it has meant everything else--faith, religion, God.",m

15043,"""I understand,"" I replied, ""I understand.""",m
15044,"And then the truth which had contained everything, the truth which was the centre and circumference of all that came to me during the time I thought I was dead, flooded my heart and brain.",m
15045,"""Life and love are everything, for these mean God.""",m
15046,"I did not ask her the result of my struggle with Liddicoat, or the outcome of the plans I had made.",m
15047,"I wanted to ask her, and yet I did not; somehow that did not seem to matter.",m
15048,I heard the birds singing in the trees around the house; heard the lowing of the cattle in the meadows; saw the sunlight streaming through the window; breathed the sweetness of the morning air.,m
15049,I had indeed entered the light and life of a new day; the world was flooded with a glory that was infinite; barriers were broken down because I had learnt the secret of life!,m
15050,"For some time we were silent; again there seemed nothing to say, because everything was too wonderful for words.",m

15053,A knock came to the door and the nurse entered.,m

15078,"The little bay in which I had lived was of great importance to them, and the cave I had discovered was their principal storehouse for petrol.",m
15079,"Indeed, since their plot was exposed and our Government officials got hold of the facts, submarines have done their work under increasing difficulty.",m
15080,Of Father Abraham I heard but little.,m
15081,"This, however, is the news which came to me: Years before, he had been sent from Germany to act as one of their agents, but later on, when he discovered what would be expected of him, he left the neighborhood; but before doing so he did his best to create the idea that he had been murdered, and that his body had been disposed of.",m
15082,"It seems that he stood in deadly fear of the Germans, and believed that he was constantly watched.",m
15083,"He was afraid to confess that he had been acting as a German agent, and that was why he didn't tell the English authorities what he knew.",m
15084,"Why he was so anxious to save me from danger I cannot fully comprehend; all I know about him I have set down in this narrative, and those who read this must draw their own conclusions.",m

15089,"Dr. Rhomboid, who came twice from London to see me, was very insistent on my taking no risks, and also kept the many visitors who desired to see me from entering the room.",m

15092,"Perhaps, however, I have said too much.",m
15093,"I did want to see Squire Treherne, and I should have been glad of a visit from the Vicar; and bearing in mind what Squire Treherne had said, I wanted to have a chat with Josiah Lethbridge.",m

15095,"I had expected to see a change in him, but not so great as had actually taken place.",m

15137,"I knew what he was thinking about--knew that he remembered, with a great sadness in his heart, that he had driven his only son from home; knew that he suffered unspeakable sorrow; and I could see that he was a different man.",m
15138,"""Isn't God good to us?"" he said huskily;",m
15139,"""and--and--Mary's forgiven me too, haven't you, my love?""",m

15146,The simple-hearted girl turned to me with a wan smile.,m

15149,"I know Hugh is not dead, he lives in heaven, and he is watching over us.",m
15150,"You believe that too, don't you, Mr. Erskine?""",m

15166,"I was silent, I remember; there seemed nothing to say.",m

15168,"Deep had called unto deep, and the Voice of God had been heard in the mysterious happenings of life.",m
15169,"I found my way to a chair close by a window, through which I looked out on the lawn, and at the flowers which surrounded it.",m
15170,"It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the sun had begun to sink, although the day was yet glorious.",m
15171,"Beyond the trees of the park I could see the wild moorland, and between two rugged tors I caught the shimmer of the sea.",m
15172,"The nurse had left the room by this time, and none but the members of the family except myself remained.",m
15173,I could not help realizing the change that had taken place.,m
15174,"When I had first entered the house the atmosphere was cold, hard, unpleasant.",m
15175,"Josiah Lethbridge was in the height of his prosperity, and he had his wife and children around him; his life did not seem to be touched with care or sorrow; no clouds seemed to hang in his sky.",m
15176,Now the death-reaper had come and had taken his only son; yet it was a far happier home than then.,m
15177,"Josiah Lethbridge had been embittered towards his son, because the latter loved a simple-minded farmer's daughter; he had even driven his son from home, because the lad would be true to his heart and marry the girl he loved.",m
15178,Now he had taken this girl to his arms; he had brought her and her baby to his home.,m

15182,"""No,"" I said, ""He never makes a mistake.""",m
15183,"""Do you say that, Erskine?""",m
15184,"""Yes, I say it,"" I replied, thinking of my own experiences and remembering the life that had come to me.",m
15185,"""Yes, I say it.""",m

15190,"But that is not God's doing, my boy; besides, even in it all, through it all, He's working His Will.",m

15198,"God lives, and because He lives His children live always.",m
15199,"I agree with you about the ghastliness, the sinfulness, the madness of war; but this war has told me that the eternal life in man laughs at death.",m
15200,"What we call death is not an end of life, it is only a beginning.",m
15201,"This life is only a fragment of life; that at all events I have learnt.""",m

15213,"I want to tell you more about it.""",m
15214,"""Yes, yes, tell me!"" he said eagerly.",m
15215,And I told him--told him of the doctor's verdict; told him of my longing for life; told him much that I have set down in these pages.,m
15216,"""I can't explain it,"" I said, when I came to describe the experiences through which I had passed after the great darkness fell upon me, ""but I KNOW, I SAW.""",m
15217,"""You felt that, saw that?""",m
15218,"""God and immortality are not matters of faith to me now, Mr. Lethbridge; they are matters of consciousness; that is why I am so certain about Hugh.",m

15221,God is here all the while; it is only our blindness that keeps us from seeing Him.,m

15223,"There are only two eternal things, Mr. Lethbridge.""",m

15311,"A few minutes later we drew up to the entrance of Trecarrel, where both Mr. and Mrs. Lethbridge stood waiting to greet me, while behind them was Mary, holding her baby in her arms.",m

15331,Precisely at seven o'clock we found our way into the dining-room.,m

15342,"For a moment he seemed to be dazzled by the light, and walked with uncertain footsteps, while we stood silent with amazement.",m
15343,Then he caught the look on his wife's face.,m
15344,"""It's Hugh!"" she gasped.",m
15345,"Hugh rushed towards her, and a second later they were locked in each other's arms.",m
15346,"""My wife!",m
15347,"My Mary!"" he cried.",m
15348,"I will not try to describe what followed, nor attempt to tell how the mother fell upon her boy's neck with fond words of endearment; how Josiah Lethbridge put his hand upon his boy's head, felt his shoulders and his arms, and patted him with infinite tenderness as though he wanted to assure himself that it was really he and not his spirit; how Isabella kissed him again and again, with all sorts of endearing terms; and how Hugh and I shook hands at least twenty times.",m
15349,"""And it is not vacant after all,"" said Josiah Lethbridge, as he saw his son sitting in the chair which had been placed opposite him.",m
15350,"""Oh, thank God!",m
15351,"Thank God!""",m
15352,Of course Hugh had a long story to tell.,m

15354,"Hugh's description was extremely hazy, because he himself scarcely knew what happened to him.",m
15355,"When he awoke to consciousness he found himself in a French peasant's hut within the German lines, and here he was kept and nursed by the owners.",m
15356,"It seemed a miracle that he should have escaped, but these peasants, seeing that he was English and hating the Germans, kept their secret well.",m
15357,"Month after month he lay ill, and even when at length he was well enough to get up, his memory had gone, and he could tell nothing about himself nor what he wanted to do.",m
15358,"By and by, however, when his faculties were restored to him, he realized the difficulties of his situation, and for a long time he schemed and planned how to get through the German lines and find his way back to his friends.",m
15359,"I will not trouble the reader with a recital of all he went through; suffice it to say that he at length succeeded, and was received by his old comrades as a man risen from the dead.",m
15360,"As may be imagined, no sooner did he get among the English than all his difficulties vanished.",m
15361,"A new uniform and money were given to him, with a lengthy leave of absence.",m
15362,"He was careful, too, to impress upon his superior officers that he didn't want any news concerning his safety to arrive in England before he himself got there.",m
15363,"He wanted to give his people a surprise, he said.",m
15364,"This being easily arranged, Hugh returned to England, and arrived in Cornwall on Christmas Eve.",m
15365,"He decided first of all to go straight to John Treleaven's farm, where he hoped to find his wife, but learning that she had gone to Trecarrel, he with a great wonder in his heart had hurried to his old home.",m
15366,The lights of Trecarrel never went out that night.,m
15367,It was Josiah Lethbridge's will that they should not.,m
15368,"Besides, we all had so much to say.",m
15369,"Hugh would have the baby brought into the room, and Josiah Lethbridge insisted that Mary's father and mother should be fetched immediately.",m
15370,"And then Hugh had to tell his story at least six times over, and we all wondered and exclaimed at each recital.",m
15371,The wonder of that night will never leave me.,m
15372,I had thought that I could never be so happy again as on the evening when Josiah Lethbridge told me he would give Isabella to me for my wife.,m
15373,But that Christmas Eve when Hugh came and the Christmas morning which followed were more wonderful still.,m
15374,"Never shall I forget how the soldier lad held his baby in his arms, and looked at it with infinite tenderness and wonder; while his wife, who had believed him dead, clung to him, uttering fond, endearing terms all the while.",m
15375,"Never shall I forget how Mrs. Lethbridge went from one to another, with tears of joy streaming down her face, or how Josiah Lethbridge, the old hard look gone from his eyes, told his children again and again how he loved them.",m
15376,I will leave my narrative here.,m
15377,"My tale is told, even while it is not finished.",m

15633,They knew the deeps and shallows of every lake and brook within many miles as intimately as a good housewife knows the shelves in her linen closet.,m
15634,"They talked in terms of blazes, snags, spring holes, and runways.",m

15637,"There had been a guide in the girls' extreme youth, a Frenchman, Pierre Amadis de Troissac, who had perhaps begun life as a gentleman.",m
15638,"Whatever his history, he had taught the precious pair the rudiments of French and the higher mysteries of fishing.",m
15639,"He had made a special study of spring holes, an essential in Adirondack trout-fishing, and whenever the Darlings wanted trout, it had only been necessary to tell De Troissac how many they wanted and to wait a few hours.",m
15640,"On those occasions when he went fishing for the larder, Lee and Gay, two little roly-polies with round, innocent eyes, often accompanied him.",m
15641,"It never occurred to De Troissac that the children could mark down the exact places from which he took fish, and, one by one and quite unintentionally, he revealed to them the hard-won secrets of his spring holes.",m

15643,"They would have told Phyllis, of course, if she had been a sport.",m

15646,"Twice she had upset a boat because a newly landed bass had suddenly begun to flop in the bottom of it, and once, coming accidentally upon a guide in the act of disembowelling a deer, she had gone into hysterics.",m
15647,"She could row, carry a boat, swim, and find the more travelled trails; but, as Lee and Gay said: ""Pill would starve in the woods directly the season was over.""",m
15648,She couldn't discharge even a twenty-two calibre rifle without shutting her eyes; she couldn't throw a fly twenty feet without snarling her leader.,m
15649,The more peaceful arts of out-of-doors had excited her imagination and latent skill.,m
15650,"In the heart of the woods, back of The Camp, not to be seen or even suspected until you came suddenly upon it, she had an acre of gardens under exquisite cultivation, and not a little glass.",m
15651,"She specialized in nectarines, white muscats of Alexandria, new peas, and heaven-blue larkspur.",m
15652,"But, for the sake of others, she grew to perfection beets, sweet corn, the lilies in variety, and immense Japanese iris.",m
15653,"As The Camp was to be turned into an inn which should serve its guests with delicious food, Phyllis and her garden became of immense importance and she began to sit much apart, marking seed catalogues with one end of a pencil and drumming on her beautiful teeth with the other.",m
15654,"Negotiations had been undertaken with a number of periodicals devoted to outdoor life, and a hundred schemes for advertising had been boiled down to one, which even Arthur was willing to let stand.",m
15655,"To embody Mary's ideas of a profitable proposition into a page of advertising without being too absurd or too ""cheap,"" had proved extremely difficult.",m
15656,"""We will run The Inn,"" she said, ""so that rich people will live very much as they would if they were doing the running.",m
15657,One big price must cover all the luxuries of home.,m
15658,We must eliminate all extras--everything which is a nuisance or a trouble.,m
15659,"Except for the trifling fact that we receive pay for it, we must treat them exactly as papa used to treat his guests.",m
15660,He gave his guests splendid food of his own ordering.,m
15661,"When they wanted cigars or cigarettes, they helped themselves.",m
15662,"There was always champagne for dinner, but if men preferred whiskey and soda, they told the butler, and he saw that they got it.",m
15663,What I'm driving at is this: There must be no difference in price for a guest who drinks champagne and one who doesn't drink anything.,m
15664,"And more important still, we must do all the laundering without extra charge; guides, guide boats, guns, and fishing-tackle must be on tap--just as papa had everything for his guests.",m
15665,"The one big price must include absolutely everything.""",m
15666,"Added to this general idea, it was further conveyed in the final advertisement that the shooting was over hundreds of thousands of acres and the fishing in countless lakes and streams.",m
15667,"And the last line of the ad, as had been previously agreed, was this:    ""PRICES RATHER HIGH.""",m
15668,"And, as Gay said to Lee: ""If that doesn't fetch 'em--you and I know something that maybe will.""",m
15669,"The full-page ad began and ended with a portrait of Uncas, the chipmunk, front view, sitting up, his cheeks puffed to the bursting point.",m
15670,"The centre of the page was occupied by a rather large view of The Camp and many of the charming little buildings which composed it, taken from the lake.",m
15671,"Throughout the text were scattered reproductions--strings of trout, a black bear, nine deer hanging in a row, and other seductions to an out-of-door life.",m
15672,For lovers of good food there was a tiny portrait of the chef and adjoining it a photograph of the largest bunch of white muscats that had ever matured in Phyllis's vinery.,m
15673,"A few days before the final proofs began to come in from the advertising managers, there arrived, addressed to Gay, a package from a firm in New York which makes a specialty of developing and printing photographs for amateurs.",m
15674,"Gay concealed the package, but Lee had noted its existence, and sighed with relief.",m
15675,A little later she found occasion to take Gay aside.,m
15676,"""Was the old film all right?",m
15677,"Did they print well?""",m
15678,Gay nodded.,m
15679,"""It always was a wonderful picture,"" she said.",m
15680,"""Us for the tall timber,"" she said--""when they come out.""",m
15681,"The final proofs being corrected and enveloped, Gay and Lee, innocent and bored of face, announced that, as there was nothing to do, they thought they would row the mail down to the village.",m
15682,"It was a seven-mile row, but that was nothing out of the ordinary for them and it was arranged that the _Streak_ should be sent after them in case they showed signs of being late for lunch.",m
15683,"Gay rowed with leisurely strokes, while Lee, seated in the stern, busied herself with a pair of scissors and a pot of paste.",m
15684,She was giving the finally corrected proofs that still more final correcting which she and Gay had agreed to be necessary.,m
15685,"They had decided that the centrepiece of the advertisement--a mere general view of The Camp--though very charming in its way, ""meant nothing,"" and they had made up their unhallowed minds to substitute in its place one of those ""fortunate snap-shots,"" the film of which Gay had--happened to preserve.",m
15686,"In this photograph the six Darling sisters were seated in a row, on the edge of The Camp float.",m
15687,Their feet and ankles were immersed.,m
15688,"They wore black bathing-dresses, exactly alike, and the bathing-dresses were of rather thin material--and very, very wet.",m
15689,"The six exquisite heads perched on the six exquisite figures proved a picture which, as Lee and Gay admitted, might cause even a worthy young man to leave home and mother.",m
15690,It was not until they were half-way home that Lee suddenly cried aloud and hid her face in her hands.,m
15691,"""For Heaven's sake,"" exclaimed Gay, ""trim boat, and what's the matter anyway?""",m
15692,"""Matter?"" exclaimed Lee;",m
15693,"""that picture of us sits right on top of the line _Prices Rather High_.",m
15694,"And it's too late to do anything about it!""",m
15695,"Gay turned white and then red, and then she burst out laughing.",m
15696,"""'Tis awful,"" she said, ""but it will certainly fetch 'em.""",m
15697,IV   The Camp itself underwent numerous changes during the winter; and even the strong-hearted Mary was appalled by the amount of money which it had been found necessary to expend.,m
15698,"The playroom would, of course, be reserved for the use of guests, and a similar though smaller and inferior room had been thrust out from the west face of Darling House for the use of the family.",m
15699,"Then Maud, who had volunteered to take charge of all correspondence and accounts, had insisted that an office be built for her near the dock.",m
15700,"This was mostly shelves, a big fireplace, and a table.",m
15701,Here guests would register upon arrival; here the incoming mail would be sorted and the outgoing weighed and stamped.,m
15702,"It had also been found necessary, in view of the very large prospective wash, to enlarge and renovate Laundry House and provide sleeping quarters for a couple of extra laundresses.",m
15703,Those who are familiar with the scarcity and reluctance of labor in the Adirondacks will best understand how these trifling matters bit into the Darling capital.,m
15704,"Sometimes Mary, who held herself responsible for the possible failure of the projected inn, could not sleep at night.",m
15705,"Suppose that the advertising, which would cost thousands of dollars, should fall flat?",m
15706,Suppose that not a single solitary person should even nibble at the high prices?,m
15707,The Darlings might even find themselves dreadfully in debt.,m
15708,The Camp would have to go.,m
15709,"She suffered from nightmares, which are bad, and from daymares, which are worse.",m
15710,"Then one day, brought across the ice from the village of Carrytown at the lower end of the lake, she received the following letter:    MISS DARLING,   The Camp, New Moon Lake in the Adirondacks, New York.",m
15711,"DEAR MADAM:--Yesterday morning, quite by accident, I saw the      prospectus of your inn on the desk of Mr. Burns, the advertising      manager of _The Four Seasons_.",m
15712,I note with regret that you are not      opening until the first of July.,m
15713,"Would it not be possible for you      to receive myself and a party of guests very much earlier, say just      when the ice has gone out of the lake and the trout are in the warm      shallows along the shores?",m
15714,"Personally, it is my plan to stay on      with you for the balance of the season, provided, of course, that      all your accommodations have not been previously taken.",m
15715,"With regard to prices, I note only that they are ""rather high.""",m
15716,"I       would suggest that, as it would probably inconvenience you to       receive guests prior to the date set for the formal opening of       your camp, you name a rate for three early weeks which would be       profitable to you.",m
15717,"There will be six men in my party, including       myself.",m
15718,"Very truly yours,   SAMUEL LANGHAM.",m
15719,"Mary, her face flushed with the bright colors of triumph, read this letter aloud to the assembled family.",m
15720,"""Does anybody,"" she asked, ""know anything about Samuel Langham?",m
15721,"Is he a suitable person?""",m
15722,"""I know of him,"" said Arthur, smiling at some recollection or other.",m
15723,"""He is what the newspapers call a 'well-known clubman.'",m
15724,"He is rich, fat, good-natured, and not old.",m
15725,It is that part of your prospectus which touches upon the _cuisine_ that has probably affected him.,m
15726,"His father was a large holder of Standard Oil securities.""",m
15727,"""As for me,"" said Gay, ""I've seen him.",m
15728,"Do you remember, Phyllis, being asked to a most 'normous dinner dance at the Redburns' the year we came out?",m
15729,"At the last minute you caught cold and wanted to back out, but Mary said _that_ wasn't done, and so I went in your place, and, as usual, nobody knew the difference.",m
15730,"Well, Mr. Langham was there.",m
15731,"I didn't meet him, but I remember I watched him eat.",m
15732,He is very smug-looking.,m
15733,He didn't like the champagne.,m
15734,I remember that.,m
15735,"He lifted his glass hopefully, took one swallow, put his glass down, and never touched it again.",m
15736,His face for the rest of dinner had the expression of one who has been deeply wronged.,m
15737,"I thought of Louis XVI mounting the scaffold.""",m
15738,"""I do wish,"" said Mary, ""that we knew what kind of wine the creature likes.""",m
15739,"""Father left a splendid collection,"" said Arthur.",m
15740,"""Take Mr. Langham into the cellar.",m
15741,He'll enjoy that.,m
15742,"Let him pick his own bottle.""",m
15743,"In the event, Maud sat down in her new office and wrote Mr. Langham that he and his five guests could be received earlier in the season.",m
15744,"And then, with fear and trembling, she named a price _per diem_ that amounted to highway robbery.",m
15745,Mr. Langham's answer was prompt and cheerful.,m
15746,He asked merely to be notified when the ice had gone out of the lake.,m
15747,"""Well,"" said Mary, with a long-drawn sigh of relief, ""the prices don't seem to have frightened him nearly as much as they frightened us.",m
15748,"But, after all, the prospectus was alluring--though we say it that shouldn't.""",m
15749,Lee and Gay were troubled by qualms of conscience.,m
15750,"The advertisements of The Camp were to appear in the February number of some of the more important periodicals, and the two scapegraces were beginning to be horribly alarmed.",m
15751,Magazines have a way of being received last by those most interested in seeing them.,m
15752,"And before even a copy of _The Four Seasons_ reached the Darlings, there came a number of letters from people who had already seen the advertisement in it.",m
15753,"One letter was from a very old friend of the family, and ran as follows:       MY DEAR MARY:        How could you!",m
15754,I have seen your advertisement of The Camp in _The       Four Seasons_.,m
15755,It is earning much talk and criticism.,m
15756,I don't know       what you could have been thinking of.,m
15757,I have always regarded you       as one of the sanest and best-bred women I know.,m
15758,"But it seems that       you are not above sacrificing your own dignity to financial       gain----  ""Well, in the name of all that's ridiculous,"" exclaimed Mary;",m
15759,"""of all that's impertinent!--will somebody kindly tell me what my personality has to do with our prospectus of The Camp?""",m
15760,Those who could have told her held their tongues and quaked inwardly.,m
15761,The others joined in Mary's surprise and indignation.,m
15762,"Even Arthur, who hated the whole innkeeping scheme, was roused out of his ordinary placidity.",m
15763,"""I shall write to the horrid old woman,"" said Mary, ""and tell her to mind her own business.",m
15764,I shall also tell her that we are receiving so many applications for accommodations that we don't know how to choose.,m
15765,"That isn't quite true, of course; but we have received some.",m
15766,"Since I am not above sacrificing my dignity""--she went on angrily--""to financial gain, I may as well throw a few lies into the bargain.""",m
15767,"The next day, addressed to ""The Camp,"" came the long-expected number of _The Four Seasons_.",m
15768,Arthur opened it and began to turn the leaves.,m
15769,"Presently, from the centre of a page, he saw his six beautiful sisters looking him in the face.",m
15770,"""Mary!"" he called, in such a voice that she came running.",m
15771,She looked and turned white.,m
15772,"Eve came, and Maud and Phyllis.",m
15773,"""Who is responsible for this--"" cried Arthur, ""for this sickening--this degraded piece of mischief?""",m
15774,"""You corrected the final proofs yourself,"" said Maud.",m
15775,"""And sealed them up.",m
15776,"If I find that some mischief-maker in the office of _The Four Seasons_ has been playing tricks----""  ""The mischief-makers are to be found nearer home,"" said Mary.",m
15777,"""Don't you remember that Lee and Gay took the proofs to the post-office.",m
15778,They said they were bored and could think of nothing to do.,m
15779,"_This_ is what they were thinking of doing!""",m
15780,"""Where are they?"" he said in a grim voice.",m
15781,"""Now, Arthur,"" said Maud, ""think before you say anything to them that you may regret.",m
15782,"As for the picture of us in our bathing-suits--well, I, for one, don't see anything dreadful about it.",m
15783,"In fact, I think we look rather lovely.""",m
15784,Arthur groaned.,m
15785,"""I want to talk to Lee and Gay,"" he said.",m
15786,"""My sisters--an advertisement in a magazine--for drummers and newsboys to make jokes about----""  He grew white and whiter, until his innocent sisters were thoroughly frightened.",m
15787,Then he started out of the playroom in search of Lee and Gay.,m
15788,In or about The Camp they were not to be found.,m
15789,Nobody had seen them since breakfast.,m
15790,"With this information, he returned to the playroom.",m
15791,"""They've run away,"" he said, ""and I'm going after them.""",m
15792,"""I wouldn't,"" said Mary.",m
15793,"""The harm's been done.",m
15794,You can't very well spank them.,m
15795,I wish you could.,m
15796,"You can only scold--and what earthly good will that do them, or you?""",m
15797,"""I don't know that anything I may say,"" said Arthur, ""_will_ do them any good.",m
15798,"I live in hopes.""",m
15799,"""Have you any idea where they've gone?""",m
15800,"""I'll cast about in a big circle and find their tracks.""",m
15801,"When Arthur, mittened and snow-shoed, had departed in search of Lee and Gay, the remaining sisters gathered about the full-page advertisement in _The Four Seasons_, and passed rapidly from anger to mild hysterics.",m
15802,Mary was the last to laugh.,m
15803,"And she said: ""Girls, I will tell you an awful secret.",m
15804,"I never would have consented to this, but as long as Lee and Gay have gone and done it, I'm--_glad_.""",m
15805,"""The only thing _I_ mind,"" said Eve, ""is Arthur.",m
15806,"He'll take it hard.""",m
15807,"""We can't help that,"" said Maud.",m
15808,"""Business is business.",m
15809,"And this wretched, shocking piece of mischief spells success.",m
15810,I feel it in my bones.,m
15811,There's no use being silly about ourselves.,m
15812,"We've got our way to make in the world--and, as a sextet----""  She lingered over the picture.",m
15813,"""As a sextet, there's no use denying that we are rather lovely to look at.""",m
15814,Phyllis put in a word blindly.,m
15815,"""Maud,"" she said, ""among the applications you have received, how many are from women?""",m
15816,Maud laughed aloud.,m
15817,"""None,"" she said.",m
15818,"""There wouldn't be,"" said Eve.",m
15819,"""Well,"" said Mary, ""compared to the rest of you, I'm quite an old woman, and I say--so much the better.""",m
15820,"V   Even on going into the open air from a warmed room, it would not have struck you as a cold day.",m
15821,But thermometers marked a number of degrees worse than zero.,m
15822,The sky was bright and blue.,m
15823,Not a breath of wind stirred.,m
15824,"In the woods the underbrush was hidden by the smooth accumulations of snow, so that the going was open.",m
15825,The Adirondack winter climate is such that a man runs less risk of getting too cold than of getting too warm.,m
15826,"Arthur, moving swiftly in a great circle so that at some point he should come upon the tracks of his culprit sisters, shed first his mittens and then his coat.",m
15827,"The former he thrust into his trousers pocket, and he hung the latter to a broken limb where he could easily find it on his return.",m
15828,"""There would be some sense in running away in summer,"" he thought.",m
15829,"""It would take an Indian or a dog to track them then, but in winter--I gave them credit for more sense.""",m
15830,"He came upon the outgoing marks of their snow-shoes presently, just beyond Phyllis's garden, to the north of the camp.",m
15831,"In imagination he saw the two lithe young beauties striding sturdily and tirelessly over the snow, and then and there the extreme pinnacles of his anger toppled and fell.",m
15832,There is no occupation to which a maiden may lend herself so virginal as woodmanship.,m
15833,And he fell to thinking less of his young sisters' indiscretion than of the extreme and unsophisticated innocence which had led them into it.,m
15834,"What could girls know of men, anyway?",m
15835,What did his sisters know of him?,m
15836,That he had been extravagant and rather fast.,m
15837,Had they an inkling of what being rather fast meant?,m
15838,His smooth forehead contracted with painful thoughts.,m
15839,Even Mary's indignation upon the discovery of the photograph in _The Four Seasons_ had not matched his own.,m
15840,"She had been angry because she was a gentlewoman, and gentlewomen shun publicity.",m
15841,She had not even guessed at the degradation to which broadcast pictures of beautiful women are subjected.,m
15842,"His anger turned from his sisters presently and glowered upon the whole world of men; his hands closed to strike, and opened to clutch and choke.",m
15843,That Lee and Gay had done such a thing was earnest only of innocence coupled with mischief.,m
15844,"They must know that what they had done was wrong, since they had fled from any immediate consequences, but how wrong it was they could never dream, even in nightmares.",m
15845,Nor was it possible for him to explain.,m
15846,"How, then, could any anger which he might visit upon them benefit?",m
15847,"And who was he, when it came to that, to assume the unassailable morality of a parent?",m
15848,"It came to this: That Arthur followed the marks of Lee's and Gay's snow-shoes mechanically, and raged, not against them, not against the world of men, but against himself.",m
15849,He had said once in jest that many an artistic impulse had been crushed by the camera and the pianola.,m
15850,But how pitifully true this had been in his own case!,m
15851,"If he had been born into less indulgence, he might have painted, he might have played.",m
15852,"The only son in a large family of daughters, his father and mother had worshipped the ground upon which his infant feet had trod.",m
15853,He had never known what it was to want anything.,m
15854,He had never been allowed to turn a hand to his own honest advantage.,m
15855,"He was the kind of boy who, under less golden circumstances, would have saved his pocket-money and built with his own hands a boat or whatever he needed.",m
15856,"There is a song: ""I want what I want when I want it.""",m
15857,"Arthur might have sung: ""I get what I'm going to want and then I don't want it.""",m
15858,"His contemporaries had greatly envied him, when, as a mere matter of justice, they should have pitied him.",m
15859,All his better impulses had been gnarled by indulgence.,m
15860,He had done things that showed natural ability; but of what use was that?,m
15861,He was too old now to learn to draw.,m
15862,"He played rather delightfully upon the piano, or any other instrument, for that matter.",m
15863,To what end?,m
15864,He could not read a note.,m
15865,"There was nothing that Arthur could not have done, if he had been let alone.",m
15866,There were many things that he would have done.,m
15867,At college he had seen in one smouldering flash of intuition how badly he had started in the race of life.,m
15868,"When others were admiring his many brilliancies, he was mourning for the lost years when, under almost any guidance save that of his beloved father, he might have laid such sturdy foundations to future achievements--pedestals on which to erect statues.",m
15869,Self-knowledge had made him hard for a season and cynical.,m
15870,"As a tired sea-gull miscalculates distance and dips his wings into the sea, so Arthur, when he thought that he was merely flying low the better to see and to observe, had alighted without much struggling in a pool of dissipation and vice.",m
15871,The memory was more of a weariness to him than a sharp regret.,m
15872,Of what use is remorse--after the fact?,m
15873,Let it come before and all will be well.,m
15874,"At last, more by accident than design, he drew out of the muddy ways into which he had fallen and limped off--not so much toward better things as away from worse.",m
15875,"Then it was that Romance had come for him, and carried him on strong wings upward toward the empyrean.",m
15876,"Even now, she was only twenty.",m
15877,She had married a man more than twice her age.,m
15878,"He had been her guardian, and she had felt that it was her duty.",m
15879,Her marriage proved desperately unhappy.,m
15880,"She and Arthur met, and, as upon a signal, loved.",m
15881,"For a few weeks of one golden summer, they had known the ethereal bliss of seeing each other every day.",m
15882,"They met as little children, and so parted.",m
15883,"They accepted the law and convention which stood between them, not as a barrier to be crossed or circumvented but with childlike faith as a something absolutely impassable--like the space which separates the earth and the moon.",m
15884,"They remained utterly innocent in thought and deed, merely loved and longed and renounced so very hard that their poor young hearts almost broke.",m
15885,"Not so the ""old man.""",m
15886,"It happened, in the autumn of that year, that he brought his wife to New York, in whose Wall Street he had intricate interests.",m
15887,He learned that she was by way of seeing more of Arthur than a girl of eighteen married to a man of nearly fifty ought to see.,m
15888,"He did not at once burst into coarse abuse of her, but, worldly-wise, set detectives to watch her.",m
15889,"He had, you may say, set his heart upon her guilt.",m
15890,To learn that she was utterly innocent enraged him.,m
15891,"One day he had the following conversation with a Mr. May, of a private detective bureau:  ""You followed them?""",m

15913,"But the ""old man"" made a scene with her, just such a scene as he would have made if the detective's report had been, in effect, the opposite of what it was.",m
15914,"He assumed that she was guilty; but, for dread of scandal, he would not seek a divorce.",m
15915,"He exacted a promise that she would not see Arthur, or write to him, or receive letters from him.",m
15916,"Then, having agreed with certain magnates to go out to China upon the question of a great railroad and a great loan, he carried her off with him, then and there.",m

15919,"If you do, it will only make my      life a hell on earth.",m

15921,But the intangible ends were infinite and not yet.,m
15922,His whole nature had changed.,m
15923,He had suffered and could no longer bear to inflict pain.,m

15933,"The girls, more particularly Lee and Gay, always attributed the instant success of The Camp to the picture; but it is sanely possible that an inn run upon such very extravagant principles was bound to be a success anyway.",m
15934,America is full of people who will pay anything for the comforts of home with the cares and exasperations left out.,m
15935,"A majority of the early applications received at The Camp office, and politely rejected by Maud, were from old friends of the family, who were eagerly willing to give its fallen finances a boost.",m

15947,It was.,m
15948,"As the _Streak_, which had gone to Carrytown to meet him, slid for the dock (his luggage was to follow in the _Tortoise_, a fatter, slower power-boat), there might have been seen standing amidships a tall, stout gentleman of about thirty-six or more, enveloped in a handsome overcoat lined with sable.",m
15949,"He wore thick eye-glasses which the swiftness of the _Streak_'s going had opaqued with icy mist, so that for the moment Mr. Samuel Langham was blind as a mole.",m
15950,"Nevertheless, determined to enjoy whatever the experience had in store for him, he beamed from right to left, as if a pair of keen eyes were revealing to him unexpected beauties and delights.",m

15958,"Mr. Langham's mouth, which was rather like a Cupid's bow, tightened.",m

16001,"""Just a few eggs,"" he said, ""and if there's anything green----""  They called the chef.",m
16002,He was very happy because the season had begun.,m
16003,"He assigned Mr. Langham a seat from which to see and at which to be served, then with the wrist-and-finger elegance of a prestidigitator, he began to prepare a few eggs and something green.",m
16004,"""The trout--"" Mary began dutifully, as it was for the sake of these that Mr. Langham had ostensibly come so early in the season.",m
16005,"""Trout?"" he said.",m
16006,"""The fishing--"" She made a new beginning.",m
16007,"""The fishing, Miss Darling,"" he said, ""will be of interest to my friends.",m

16012,Something told me that I should be allowed to breakfast in the kitchen.,m
16013,"The more I thought about it the less I felt that I could wait for the somewhat late opening of your season, so I pretended to be a fisher of trout.",m
16014,And here I am.,m

16026,Is it gross to be fond of food?,m
16027,So many people think so.,m
16028,I differ with them.,m

16041,Whenever he had a chance he gazed at Mary.,m
16042,It was her face in the row of six that had lured him out of all his habits and made him feel that the camp offered him a genuine chance for happiness.,m
16043,To find that she presided over the kitchen had filled his cup to the brim.,m
16044,"But when he remembered that he was fat and fond of good things to eat and drink, his heart sank.",m
16045,He determined that he would eat but three eggs.,m
16046,"They were, however, prepared in a way that was quite new to him, and in the determined effort to discern the ingredients and the method he ate five.",m
16047,"""There is something very keen about your Adirondack air,"" he explained guiltily.",m
16048,But Mary had warmed to him.,m

16050,She knew that the better you feed people the more they love you.,m
16051,She was not revolted by Mr. Langham's appetite.,m
16052,She felt that even a canary of a man must have fallen before the temptation of those eggs.,m
16053,They were her own invention.,m
16054,And chef had executed them to the very turn of perfection.,m

16058,They consulted.,m
16059,They compared menus.,m
16060,They mastered the contents of the late Mr. Darling's cellars.,m
16061,Mr. Langham chose Lone House for his habitation.,m
16062,He liked the little balcony that thrust out over the lake between the two pine-trees.,m
16063,"And by the time that his guests were due to arrive, he had established himself, almost, in the affections of the entire family.",m
16064,"""He may be greedy,"" said Arthur, ""but he's the most courteous man that ever 'sat at meat among ladies'!""",m

16066,"VII   Mr. Langham's five guests arrived somewhat noisily, smoking five long cigars.",m
16067,"Lee and Gay, watching the float from a point of vantage, where they themselves were free from observation, observed that three of the trout fishermen were far older than they had led themselves to expect.",m

16075,"Now he's probably never been in a fast boat in his life till to-day, and yet he looks thoroughly bored.""",m
16076,The Englishman without changing his expression made some remark to the other five.,m

16232,"""If I land the three-pounder, you become the countess; if I don't, I pay you the amount of your dividends for the year.",m
16233,"Is that better?""",m
16234,"""Much,"" smiled Gay;",m
16235,"""because, with the bet in this form, there is practically no danger that either of us will lose anything.",m
16236,"My dividends probably won't amount to a row of pins, and you most certainly will not land so big a fish.""",m
16237,Meanwhile they had entered the mouth of Placid Brook.,m
16238,"The surface was dimpling--rings became, spread, merged in one another, and were not.",m
16239,The fish were feeding.,m
16240,"""Let us land in the meadow,"" said Mr. Pritchard, his brown eyes clear and sparkling, ""and spy upon the enemy.""",m
16241,"""Are you going to leave your rod and things in the boat?""",m
16242,"""For the present--until we have located our fish.""",m
16243,"They landed, and he advanced upon the brook by a detour, stealthily, crouching, his field-glasses at attention.",m
16244,"Once he turned and spoke to Gay in an authoritative whisper:  ""Try not to show above the bushes.""",m
16245,"VIII   The sun was warm on the meadow, and although the bushes along its margin were leafless, the meadow itself had a greenish look, and the feel of the air was such that Gay, upon whom silence and invisibility had been enjoined, longed to dance in full sight of the trout and to sing at the top of her voice: ""Oh, that we two were Maying!""",m
16246,"Instead, she crouched humbly and in silence at Pritchard's side, while he studied the dimpling brook through his powerful field-glasses.",m
16247,"Gay had never seen red Indians except in Buffalo Bill's show, where it is made worth their while to be very noisy.",m
16248,"But she had read her Cooper and her Ballantyne,    ""Ballantyne, the brave,   And Cooper of the wood and wave,""  and she knew of the early Christian patience with which they are supposed to go about the business of hunting and fishing.",m
16249,"Pritchard, she observed, had a weather-red face and high cheek-bones.",m
16250,He was smooth-shaved.,m
16251,He wore no hat.,m
16252,"But for his miraculously short-cut hair, his field-glasses, his suit of coarse Scotch wool, whose colors blended so well with the meadow upon which he crouched, he might have been an Indian.",m
16253,"His head, the field-glasses, the hands which clasped them, moved--nothing else.",m
16254,"""Is it a bluff?"" thought Gay.",m
16255,"""Is he just posing, or is there something in it?""",m
16256,Half an hour passed--three quarters.,m
16257,Gay was pale and grimly smiling.,m
16258,Her legs had gone to sleep.,m
16259,But she would not give in.,m
16260,"If an Englishman could fish so patiently, why, so could she.",m
16261,She was fighting her own private battle of Bunker Hill--of New Orleans.,m
16262,"Pritchard lowered his glasses, handed them to Gay, and pointed up the brook and across, to where a triangular point of granite peered a few inches above the surface.",m
16263,"Gay looked through the glasses, and Pritchard began to whisper in her ear:  ""Northwest of that point of rock, about two feet--keep looking just there, and I'll try to tell you what to see.""",m
16264,"""There's a fish feeding,"" she answered;",m
16265,"""but he must be a baby, he just makes a bubble on the surface.""",m
16266,"""There are three types of insect floating over him,"" said Pritchard;",m
16267,"""I don't know your American beasts by name, but there is a black, a brown, and a grayish spiderlike thing.",m
16268,He's taking the last.,m
16269,"If you see one of the gray ones floating where he made his last bubble, watch it.""",m
16270,"Gay presently discerned such an insect so floating, and watched it.",m
16271,"It passed within a few inches of where the feeding trout had last risen and disappeared, and a tiny ring gently marked the spot where it had been sucked under.",m
16272,"Gay saw a black insect pass over the fatal spot unscathed, then browns; and then, once more, a gray, very tiny in the body but with longish legs, approached and was engulfed.",m
16273,"""Now for the tackle box,"" Pritchard whispered.",m
16274,"They withdrew from the margin of the brook, Gay in that curious ecstasy, half joy, half sorrow, induced by sleepy legs.",m
16275,She lurched and almost fell.,m
16276,Pritchard caught her.,m
16277,"""Was the vigil too long?"" he asked.",m
16278,"""I liked it,"" she said.",m
16279,"""But my legs went to sleep and are just waking up.",m
16280,Tell me things.,m
16281,There were fish rising bold--jumping clean out--making the water boil.,m
16282,"But you weren't interested in them.""",m
16283,"""It was noticeable,"" said Pritchard, ""and perhaps you noticed that one fish was feeding alone.",m
16284,He blew his little rings--without fear or hurry--none of the other fishes dared come anywhere near him.,m
16285,He lives in the vicinity of that pointed rock.,m
16286,"The water there is probably deep and, in the depths, very cold.",m
16287,Who knows but a spring bubbles into a brook at the base of that rock?,m
16288,The fish lives there and rules the water around him for five or six yards.,m
16289,"He is selfish, fat, and old.",m
16290,He feeds quietly because nobody dares dispute his food with him.,m
16291,He is the biggest fish in this reach of the brook.,m
16292,"At least, he is the biggest that is feeding this morning.",m
16293,Now we know what kind of a fly he is taking.,m
16294,Probably I have a close imitation of it in my fly box.,m
16295,"If not, we shall have to make one.",m
16296,"Then we must try to throw it just above him--very lightly--float it into his range of vision, and when he sucks it into his mouth, strike--and if we are lucky we shall then proceed to take him.""",m
16297,"Gay, passionately fond of woodcraft, listened with a kind of awe.",m
16298,"""But,"" she said, seeing an objection, ""how do you know he weighs three pounds and over?""",m
16299,"""Frankly,"" said Pritchard, ""I don't.",m
16300,"I am gambling on _that_.""",m
16301,He shot her a shy look.,m
16302,"""Just hoping.",m
16303,I know that he is big.,m
16304,I believe we shall land him.,m
16305,"I hope and pray that he weighs over three pounds.""",m
16306,Gay blushed and said nothing.,m
16307,"She was beginning to think that Pritchard might land a three-pounder as well as not--and she had light-heartedly agreed, in that event, to become the Countess of Merrivale.",m
16308,"Of course, the bet was mere nonsense.",m
16309,"But suppose, by any fleeting chance, that Pritchard should not so regard it?",m
16310,What _should_ she do?,m
16311,Suppose that Pritchard had fallen victim to a case of love at first sight?,m
16312,"It would not, she was forced to admit (somewhat demurely), be the first instance in her own actual experience.",m
16313,"There was a young man who had so fallen in love with her, and who, a week later, not knowing the difference--so exactly the triplets resembled each other--had proposed to Phyllis.",m
16314,"They drew the guide boat up onto the meadows and Pritchard, armed with a scoop-net of mesh as fine as mosquito-netting, leaned over the brook and caught one of the grayish flies that were tickling the appetite of the big trout.",m
16315,This fly had a body no bigger than a gnat's.,m
16316,Pritchard handed Gay a box of japanned tin.,m
16317,"It was divided into compartments, and each compartment was half full of infinitesimal trout flies.",m
16318,They were so small that you had to use a pair of tweezers in handling them.,m
16319,"Pritchard spread his handkerchief on the grass, and Gay dumped the flies out on it and spread them for examination.",m
16320,"And then, their heads very close together, they began to hunt for one which would match the live one that Pritchard had caught.",m
16321,"""But they're too small,"" Gay objected.",m
16322,"""The hooks would pull right through a trout's lip.""",m
16323,"""Not always,"" said Pritchard.",m
16324,"""How about this one?""",m
16325,"""Too dark,"" said Gay.",m
16326,"""Here we are then--a match or not?""",m
16327,The natural fly and the artificial placed side by side were wonderfully alike.,m
16328,"""They're as like as Lee and me,"" said Gay.",m
16329,"""Lee?""",m
16330,"""Three of us are triplets,"" she explained.",m
16331,"""We look exactly alike--and we never forgive people who get us mixed up.""",m
16332,Pritchard abandoned all present thoughts of trout-fishing by scientific methods.,m
16333,He looked into her face with wonder.,m
16334,"""Do you mean to tell me,"" said he, ""that there are two other D-D-Darlings exactly like you?""",m
16335,"""Exactly--a nose for a nose; an eye for an eye.""",m
16336,"""It isn't true,"" he proclaimed.",m
16337,"""There is nobody in the whole world in the least like you.""",m
16338,"""Some time,"" said Gay, ""you will see the three of us in a row.",m
16339,We shall look inscrutable and say nothing.,m
16340,"You will not be able to tell which of us went fishing with you and which stayed at home----""  ""'This little pig went to market,'"" he began, and abruptly became serious.",m
16341,"""Is that a challenge?""",m
16342,"""Yes,"" said Gay.",m
16343,"""I fling down my gauntlet.""",m
16344,"""And I,"" said Pritchard, ""step forward and, in the face of all the world, lift it from the ground--and proclaim for all the world to hear that there is nobody like my lady--and that I am so prepared to prove at any place or time--come weal, come woe.",m
16345,"Let the heavens fall!""",m
16346,"""If you know me from the others,"" Gay's eyes gleamed, ""you will be the first strange young man that ever did, and I shall assign and appoint in the inmost shrines of memory a most special niche for you.""",m
16347,Pritchard bowed very humbly.,m
16348,"""That will not be necessary,"" he said.",m
16349,"""If I land the three-pounder.",m
16350,"In that case, I should be always with you.""",m
16351,"""I wish,"" said Gay, ""that you wouldn't refer so earnestly to a piece of nonsense.",m
16352,"Upon repetition, a joke ceases to be a joke.""",m
16353,Pritchard looked troubled.,m
16354,"""I'm sorry,"" he said simply.",m
16355,"""If it is the custom of the country to bet and then crawl, so be it.",m
16356,"In Rome, I hasten to do as the Romans do.",m
16357,But I thought our bet was honorable and above-board.,m
16358,"It seems it was just an--an Indian bet.""",m
16359,Gay flushed angrily.,m
16360,"""You shall not belittle anything American,"" she said.",m
16361,"""It was a bet.",m
16362,I meant it.,m
16363,I stand by it.,m
16364,If you catch your big fish I marry you.,m
16365,"And if I have to marry you, I will lead you such a dance----""  ""You wouldn't have to,"" Pritchard put in gently, ""you wouldn't have to lead me, I mean.",m
16366,"If you and I were married, I'd just naturally dance--wouldn't I?",m
16367,When a man sorrows he weeps; when he rejoices he dances.,m
16368,"It's all very simple and natural----""  He turned his face to the serene heavens, and, very gravely:  ""Ah, Lord!"" he said.",m
16369,"""Vouchsafe to me, undeserving but hopeful, this day, a char--_salmo fontinalis_--to weigh a trifle over three pounds, for the sake of all that is best and sweetest in this best of all possible worlds.""",m
16370,"If his face or voice had had a suspicion of irreverence, Gay would have laughed.",m
16371,"Instead, she found that she wanted to cry and that her heart was beating unquietly.",m
16372,"Mr. Pritchard dismissed sentiment from his mind, and with loving hands began to take a powerful split-bamboo rod from its case.",m
16373,IX   Gay's notion of scientific fishing might have been thus summed: Know just where to fish and use the lightest rod made.,m
16374,Her own trout-rod weighed two and a half ounces without the reel.,m
16375,"Compared to it, Pritchard's was a coarse and heavy instrument.",m
16376,His weighed six ounces.,m
16377,"""You could land a salmon with that,"" said Gay scornfully.",m
16378,"""I have,"" said Pritchard.",m
16379,"""It's a splendid rod.",m
16380,"I doubt if you could break it.""",m
16381,"""Doesn't give the fish much of a run for his money.""",m
16382,"""But how about this, Miss Gay?""",m
16383,He showed her a leader of finest water-blue catgut.,m
16384,It was nine feet long and tapered from the thickness of a human hair to that of a thread of spider-spinning.,m
16385,Gay's waning admiration glowed once more.,m
16386,"""That wouldn't hold a minnow,"" she said.",m
16387,"""We must see about that,"" he answered;",m
16388,"""we must hope that it will hold a very large char.""",m
16389,"He reeled off eighty or ninety feet of line, and began to grease it with a white tallow.",m
16390,"""What's that stuff?""",m
16391,Gay asked.,m
16392,"""Red-deer fat.""",m
16393,"""What for?""",m
16394,"""To make the line float.",m
16395,"We're fishing with a dry-fly, you know.""",m
16396,Gay noticed that the line was tapered from very heavy to very fine.,m
16397,"""Why is that?"" she asked.",m
16398,"""It throws better--especially in a wind.",m
16399,"The heavy part will carry a fly out into half a gale.""",m
16400,"He reeled in the line and made his leader fast to it with a swift, running hitch, and to the line end of the leader he attached the fly which they had chosen.",m
16401,"Upon this tiny and exquisite arrangement of fairy hook, gray silk, and feathers, he blew paraffin from a pocket atomizer that it might float and not become water-logged.",m
16402,"""Do we fish from the shore or the boat?""",m
16403,Gay asked.,m
16404,"""From this shore.""",m
16405,"""You'll never reach there from this shore.""",m
16406,"""Then I've misjudged the distance.",m
16407,"Are you going to use the landing-net for me, in case it's necessary?""",m
16408,Gay caught up the net and once more followed his stealthy advance upon the brook.,m
16409,"Pritchard had one preliminary look through the field-glasses, straightened his bent back, turned to her with a sorrowing face, and spoke aloud.",m
16410,"""He's had enough,"" he said.",m
16411,"""He's stopped feeding.""",m
16412,Gay burst out laughing.,m
16413,"""And our fishing is over for the day?",m
16414,"This shall be said of you, Mr. Pritchard, that you are a merciful man.",m
16415,"You are not what is called in this country a 'game hog.'""  ""Thank you,"" he said gravely.",m
16416,"""But if you think the fishing is over for the day, you don't know a dry-fly fisherman when you see one.",m
16417,We made rather a late start.,m
16418,"See, most of the fish have stopped feeding.",m
16419,They won't begin again much before three.,m
16420,The big fellow will be a little later.,m
16421,"He has had more than the others; he is older; his digestion is no longer like chain lightning; he will sleep sounder, and dream of the golden days of his youth when a char was a trout.""",m
16422,"""_That_,"" said Gay, ""is distinctly unkind.",m
16423,I have been snubbed enough for one day.,m
16424,"Are we to stand here, then, till three or four o'clock, till his royal highness wakes up and calls for breakfast?""",m
16425,"""No,"" said Pritchard;",m
16426,"""though I would do so gladly, if it were necessary, in order to take this particular fish----""  ""You might kneel before your rod,"" said Gay, ""like a knight watching his arms.""",m
16427,"""To rise in the morning and do battle for his lady--I repeat I should do so gladly if it would help my chances in the slightest.",m
16428,"But it wouldn't.""",m
16429,He rested his rod very carefully across two bushes.,m
16430,"""The thing for us to do,"" he went on, ""is to have lunch.",m
16431,"I've often heard of how comfortable you American guides can make the weary, wayworn wanderer at the very shortest notice.""",m
16432,"""Is that a challenge?""",m
16433,"""It is an expression of faith.""",m
16434,"Their eyes met, and even lingered.",m
16435,"""In that case,"" said Gay, ""I shall do what I may.",m
16436,"There is cold lunch in the boat, but the wayworn one shall bask in front of a fire and look upon his food when it is piping hot.",m
16437,"Come!""",m
16438,Gay rowed him out of the brook and along the shore of the lake for a couple of miles.,m
16439,She was on her mettle.,m
16440,She wished him to know that she was no lounger in woodcraft.,m
16441,"She put her strong young back into the work of rowing, and the fragile guide boat flew.",m
16442,"Her cheeks glowed, and her lips were parted in a smile, but secretly she was filled with dread.",m
16443,"She knew that she had brought food, raw and cooked; she could see the head of her axe gleaming under the middle seat; she would trust Mary for having seen to it that there was pepper and salt; but whether in the pocket of the Norfolk jacket there were matches, she could not be sure.",m
16444,"If she stopped rowing to look, the Englishman would think that she had stopped because she was tired.",m
16445,"And if, later, it was found that she had come away without matches, he would laugh at her and her pretenses to being a ""perfectly good guide.""",m
16446,"She beached the boat upon the sand in a wooded cove, and before Pritchard could move had drawn it high and dry out of the water.",m
16447,"Then she laughed aloud, and would not tell him why.",m
16448,"She had discovered in the right-hand pocket of her coat two boxes of safety-matches, and in the left pocket three.",m
16449,"""Don't,"" said Gay, ""this is my job.""",m
16450,She lifted the boat easily and carried it into the woods.,m
16451,Pritchard had wished to help.,m
16452,"She laid the boat upon soft moss at the side of a narrow, mounting trail, slung the package of lunch upon her shoulders, and caught up her axe.",m
16453,"""Don't I help at all?"" asked Pritchard.",m
16454,"""You are weary and wayworn,"" said Gay, ""and I suppose I ought to carry you, too.",m
16455,But I can't.,m
16456,Can you follow?,m
16457,"It's not far.""",m
16458,"A quarter of a mile up the hillside, between virgin pines which made one think bitterly of what the whole mountains might be if the science of forestry had been imported a little earlier in the century, the steep and stony trail ended in an open space, gravelly and abounding in huge bowlders, upon which the sun shone warm and bright.",m
16459,"In the midst of the place was a spring, black and slowly bubbling.",m
16460,"At the base of one great rock, a deep rift in whose face made a natural chimney, were traces of former fires.",m
16461,"""Wait here,"" commanded Gay.",m
16462,"Her axe sounded in a thicket, and she emerged presently staggering under a load of balsam.",m
16463,"She spread it in two great, fragrant mats.",m
16464,Then once more she went forth with her axe and returned with fire-wood.,m
16465,"Pritchard, a wistful expression in his eyes, studied her goings and her comings, and listened as to music, to the sharp, true ringing of her axe.",m
16466,"""By Jove,"" said he to himself, ""that isn't perspiration on her forehead--it's honest sweat!""",m
16467,"In spite of the bright sunshine, the heat of the fire was wonderfully welcome, and began to bring out the strong, delicious aroma of the balsam.",m
16468,Gay sat upon her heels before the fire and cooked.,m
16469,There was a sound of boiling and bubbling.,m
16470,The fragrance of coffee mingled with the balsam and floated heavenward.,m
16471,During the swift preparation of lunch they hardly spoke.,m
16472,Twice Pritchard begged to help and was twice refused.,m
16473,"She spread a cloth between the mats of balsam upon one of which Pritchard reclined, and she laid out hot plates and bright silver with demure precision.",m
16474,"""Miss Gay,"" he said very earnestly, ""I came to chuckle;",m
16475,"I thought that at least you would burn the chicken and get smoke in your eyes, but I remain to worship the deity of woodcraft.",m

16477,Gay swelled a little.,m
16478,"She had worked very hard; nothing had gone wrong, so far.",m
16479,She was not in the least ashamed of herself.,m

16481,"Uncas, the chipmunk, had that morning gone for a stroll in the forest.",m
16482,He had the spring fever.,m
16483,"He had crossed Placid Brook, by a fallen log; he had climbed trees, hunted for last year's nuts, and fought battles of repartee with other chipmunks.",m
16484,"About lunch time, thinking to return to Arthur and recount the tale of his wanderings, he smelled a smell of cooking and heard a sound of voices, one of which was familiar to him.",m
16485,"He climbed a bowlder overlooking the clearing, and began to scold.",m
16486,Gay and Pritchard looked up.,m
16487,"""My word!"" said Pritchard, ""what a bold little beggar.""",m
16488,"Now, to Gay, the figure of Uncas, well larded with regular meals, was not to be confounded with the slim little stripes of the spring woods.",m

16498,"Here, when he had been fed, he yawned, stretched himself, and fell asleep.",m
16499,"""Mowgli's sister!"" said Pritchard reverently.",m

16548,"He did not ""whip"" the brook; he whipped the air above it.",m
16549,"He never allowed his fly to touch the water but drew it back sharply, and, at the same time, reeled out more line with his left hand, when it had fallen to within an inch or two of the surface.",m

16560,"All the while he talked, he continued casting with compact, forceful strokes of his right wrist and forearm.",m
16561,"At last, his judgment being satisfied by the hovering position attained by fly and leader, he relaxed his grip of the rod; the fly fell upon the water like thistle-down, floated five or six inches, and was sucked under by the big trout.",m
16562,Pritchard struck hard.,m
16563,"There was a second's pause, while the big trout, pained and surprised, tried to gather his scattered wits.",m
16564,"Three quarters of Pritchard's line floated loosely across the brook, but the leader and the fly remained under, and Pritchard knew that he had hooked his fish.",m
16565,"Then, and it was sudden--like an explosion--the whole length of floating line disappeared, and the tip of Pritchard's powerful rod was dragged under after it.",m
16566,The reel screamed.,m

16577,It was the strong man without science against the strong man who knows how to box.,m
16578,"The steady, furious rushes, snubbed and controlled, became jerky and spasmodic; in a roar and swirl of water the king trout showed his gleaming and enormous back; a second later the sunset colors of his side and the white of his belly.",m

16593,"One titanic convulsion of tortured muscles, and what was to be expected happened.",m
16594,"The leader broke a few inches from the trout's lip, and he returned splashing to his native element, swam off slowly, just under the surface, then dove deep, and was seen no more.",m

16610,"""No,"" she said;",m
16611,"""I was thinking other things.",m

16613,"You see, I'd made up my mind to keep my word.",m
16614,"And, well, of course, it's a great escape for me.",m

16616,"Was the prospect of marrying me so awful?""",m
16617,"""The prospect of marrying a man who would rather lose a five-pound fish than marry me--was awful.""",m
16618,"Pritchard stopped rowing, and his laughter went abroad over the quiet lake until presently Gay's forehead smoothed and, after a prelude of dimples, she joined gayly in.",m
16619,"When Pritchard could speak, he said:  ""You don't really think that, do you?""",m

16828,"Langham, Renier, and the future Earl of Merrivale remained, of course, upon their well-established footing of companionship, but the Darlings began to play their parts of innkeepers with the utmost seriousness and to fight shy of any social advances from the ranks of their guests.",m
16829,"Indeed, for the real heads of the family, Mary, Maud, and Eve, there was serious work to be done.",m
16830,"For, to keep thirty or forty exigent and extravagant people well fed, well laundered, well served, and well amused is no frisky skirmish but a morning-to-night battle, a constant looking ahead, a steady drain upon the patience and invention.",m
16831,In Sam Langham Mary found an invaluable ally.,m
16832,"He knew how to live, and could guess to a nicety the ""inner man"" of another.",m
16833,Nor did he stop at advice.,m
16834,Being a celebrated _bon viveur_ he went subtly among the guests and praised the machinery of whose completed product they were the consumers and the beneficiaries.,m
16835,"He knew of no place, he confided, up and down the whole world, where, for a sum of money, you got exactly what you wanted without asking for it.",m

16844,Among the new guests was a young man from Boston by the name of Herring.,m
16845,He had written that he was convalescing from typhoid fever and that his doctor had prescribed Adirondack air.,m

16849,He isn't good at things.,m
16850,But he does them.,m
16851,He's the fellow that went to the Barren Lands with a niblick.,m
16852,"What, you never heard of that stunt?",m
16853,He was playing in foursome at Myopia.,m
16854,He got bunkered.,m
16855,He hit the sand a prodigious blow and the ball never moved.,m
16856,"His partner said: 'Never mind, Syd, you hit hard enough to kill a musk-ox.'",m
16857,"""'Did I?' said Herring, much interested, 'but I never heard of killing a musk-ox with a niblick.",m

16859,Are there any authorities one might consult?',m
16860,"""His partner assured him that 'it' had never been done.",m
16861,Herring said that was enough for him.,m
16862,The charm of Herring is that he never smiles; he's deadly serious--or pretends to be.,m
16863,"When they had holed out at the eighteenth, Herring took his niblick and said: 'Well, so long.",m
16864,I'm off to the Barren Lands.',m
16865,"""They bet him there and then that he would neither go to the Barren Lands nor kill a musk-ox when he got there.",m
16866,"He took their bets, which were large.",m
16867,"And he went to the Barren Lands, armed only with his niblick and a camera.",m
16868,But he didn't kill a musk-ox.,m
16869,"He said they came right up to be photographed, and he hadn't the heart to strike.",m
16870,"He brought back plenty enough pictures to prove where he'd been, but no musk-ox.",m
16871,He aimed at one tentatively but at the last moment held his hand.,m
16872,"'He remembered suddenly,' he said, 'that he had never killed anything, and didn't propose to begin.'",m
16873,So he came home and paid one bet and pocketed the other.,m

16876,"""Something tells me,"" said Pritchard, ""that I shall like him.""",m
16877,"Herring, having arrived and registered and been shown his rooms, was not thereafter seen to speak to anybody for two whole days.",m
16878,"As a matter of fact, though, he held some conversation with Renier, whom he had met before.",m

16881,"Give him time and he will blossom.""",m
16882,"""He looks like a blossom already,"" said Lee.",m
16883,"""He looks at a little distance like a gigantic plant of scarlet salvia, or a small maple-tree in October.""",m
16884,"Upon the third day Mr. Herring came out of his shell, as had been prophesied.",m
16885,"He went about asking guests and guides, with almost plaintive seriousness, questions which they were unable to answer.",m
16886,He began to make friends with Pritchard and Langham.,m
16887,He solemnly presented Arthur with a baseball that had figured in a Yale-Harvard game.,m
16888,Then he got himself introduced to Lee.,m
16889,"""You guide, don't you?"" he said.",m
16890,"""I have guided,"" she said, ""but I don't.",m
16891,It was only in the beginning of things when there weren't enough real guides to go around.,m

16894,"You ought to be a first-class woodsman.""",m
16895,"""I thought I'd like to go fishing to-morrow,"" he said.",m
16896,"""It's very disappointing.",m
16897,"I've looked forward all my life to being guided by a young girl, and when I saw you, I said, if this isn't she, this is her living image.""",m
16898,"""You shall have Bullard,"" said Lee.",m
16899,"""He knows all the best places.""",m
16900,Herring complained to Arthur.,m
16901,"""Your sisters,"" he said, ""are said to be the best guides in the Adirondacks, but they won't take me out.",m
16902,"How is a fellow to convalesce from typhoid if people aren't unfailingly kind to him?""",m
16903,"Arthur laughed, and said that he didn't know.",m
16904,"""Let me guide you,"" he offered.",m
16905,"""No,"" said Herring, ""it isn't that I want to be guided.",m
16906,It's that I want the experience of being guided by a girl.,m
16907,"I want to lean back and be rowed.""",m
16908,"Herring walked in the woods and came upon Phyllis's garden, with Phyllis in the midst of it.",m
16909,"""Halloo again!"" he said.",m
16910,Now it so happened that he had never seen Phyllis before.,m
16911,She straightened from a frame of baby lettuce and smiled.,m
16912,"She loved bright colors, and his flaming hair was becoming to her garden.",m
16913,"""Halloo again!"" she said.",m
16914,"""Have you changed your mind?"" he asked.",m

16918,"""So have I,"" said Phyllis wistfully.",m
16919,"""We could be back before breakfast.""",m
16920,Phyllis appeared to think the matter over.,m

16922,"But if girls didn't change their minds, they wouldn't be girls.""",m
16923,"""That,"" said Phyllis, ""is perfectly true.""",m
16924,"To herself she said:  ""He's asked Lee or Gay to guide him, and thinks he's asked me.""",m
16925,"Now, Phyllis was not good with oars or fishing-tackle, but she liked Herring's hair and the fact that he never smiled.",m
16926,"Furthermore, she believed that, if the worst came to the worst, she could find some of the places where people sometimes took trout.",m
16927,"""I have never,"" said Herring, ""been guided by a young girl.""",m

16929,"""Never,"" he said.",m
16930,"""And I am sure that it would work wonders for me.""",m

16936,"""You'll swear not to tell?"" she exhorted.",m
16937,"""Yes,"" he said, ""but not here.",m
16938,Soon.,m
16939,"When I am alone.""",m
16940,He did not smile.,m
16941,"""Then,"" she said, ""be at the float at five-thirty sharp.""",m
16942,That night she sought out Lee and Gay.,m
16943,"""Such a joke,"" she said.",m
16944,"""I've promised to guide Mr. Herring--to-morrow at five-thirty, but he thinks that it's one of you two who has promised.",m
16945,"Now, as I don't row or fish, one of you will have to take my place for the credit of the family.""",m
16946,But her sisters were laughing in their sleeves.,m
16947,"""My dear girl,"" said Gay, ""why the dickens didn't you tell us sooner?",m
16948,"We also have made positive engagements at five-thirty to-morrow morning.""",m
16949,"""What engagements?"" exclaimed Phyllis.",m
16950,Gay leaned close and whispered confidentially.,m
16951,"""We've made positive engagements,"" she said, ""to sleep till breakfast time.""",m
16952,XIII   In an athletic generation Phyllis was an anachronism.,m
16953,"She was the sort of girl one's great-grandmother was, only better-looking--one's great-grandmother, if there is any truth in oil and canvas, having been neatly and roundly turned out of a peg of wood.",m
16954,"Phyllis played no game well, unless gardening is a game.",m
16955,She liked to embroider and to write long letters in a wonderfully neat hand.,m
16956,She disliked intensely the roaring of firearms and the diabolic flopping of fresh-caught fish.,m
16957,"She was one of those people who never look at a sunset or a moonrise or a flower without actually seeing them, and yet, withal, her sisters Lee and Gay looked upon her with a certain awe and respect.",m
16958,She was so strong in the wrists and fingers that she could hold them when they were rambunctious.,m
16959,And she was only afraid of things that aren't in the least dangerous.,m
16960,"""No,"" they said, ""she can't fish and shoot and row and play tennis and dive and swim under water, but she's the best dancer in the family--probably in the world--and the best sport.""",m
16961,"Phyllis was, in truth, a good sport, or else she was more attracted by Mr. Herring's _Salvia-splendens_ hair than she would have cared to admit.",m
16962,"Whatever the cause, she met him at the float the next morning at five-thirty, prepared to guide him or perish in the attempt.",m
16963,She wore a short blue skirt and a long white sweater of Shetland wool.,m
16964,It weighed about an ounce.,m
16965,She wore white tennis shoes and an immense pair of well-oiled gardening gloves.,m
16966,At least she would put off blistering her hands as long as possible.,m
16967,"Phyllis, to be exact, was five minutes early for her appointment.",m
16968,"This gave her time to get a boat into the water without displaying awkwardness to any one but herself--also, to slip the oars over the thole-pins and to accustom herself to the idea of handling them.",m
16969,"She had taken coaching the night before from Lee and Gay, sitting on a bearskin rug in front of the fire, and swaying rhythmically forward and back.",m
16970,"As Herring was no fisherman, her sisters advised her to row very slowly.",m
16971,"""Tell him,"" they said, ""that a boat rushing through water alarms fish more than anything in the world.""",m
16972,She told him when he was seated in the stern of the boat facing her.,m
16973,"""You mustn't mind going very slow,"" she said.",m
16974,"""The fish in this part of the Adirondacks are noted for their sensitiveness in general and their acute sense of hearing in particular.",m
16975,"Why, if I were to row as fast as I can""--there must have been a twinkle in her eyes--""trout miles away would be frightened out of their skins,"" and she added mentally, ""and I should upset this horribly wabbly boat into the bargain.""",m
16976,"They proceeded at a snail's pace, Phyllis dabbing the water gingerly with her oars, with something of that caution and repulsion with which one turns over a dead snake with a stick--to see if it is dead.",m
16977,The grips of guide-boat oars overlap.,m
16978,"And your hands follow rather than accompany each other from catch to finish, and from finish to catch.",m
16979,"If you are careless, or not to the stroke born or trained, you occasionally knock little chunks of skin and flesh from your knuckles.",m
16980,Herring watched Phyllis's gentle and restrained efforts with inscrutable eyes.,m
16981,"""I never could understand,"" he said, ""how you fellows manage to row at all with that sort of an outfit.",m
16982,"At Harvard they only give you one oar and let you take both hands to it, and then you can't row.",m
16983,"At least, I couldn't.",m
16984,They put me right out of the boat.,m
16985,They said I caught crabs.,m
16986,"As a matter of fact, I didn't.",m
16987,"All I did was to sit there, and every now and then the handle of my oar banged me across the solar plexus.""",m
16988,"""We're not going far, you know,"" said Phyllis (and she mastered the desire to laugh).",m
16989,"""Hadn't you--ah--um--better put your rod together?""",m
16990,"""Oh, I can do that!"" said Herring.",m
16991,"""You begin with the big piece and you stick the next-sized piece into that, and so on.",m
16992,"And I know how to put the reel on, because the man in the store showed me, and I know how to run the line through the rings.""",m
16993,"""Well,"" said Phyllis, ""that's more than half the battle.""",m
16994,"""And,"" Herring continued, ""he showed me how to tie on the what-you-may-call-it and the flies.""",m
16995,"""Good!"" said Phyllis.",m
16996,"""And, of course,"" he concluded, ""I've forgotten.""",m
16997,"Now, Phyllis had been shown how to tie flies to a leader only the night before, and she, also, had forgotten.",m
16998,"""There are,"" she said, ""a great many fetiches among anglers.",m
16999,Among them are knots.,m
17000,"Now, in my experience, almost any knot that will stand will do.",m
17001,"The important thing is to choose the right flies.""",m
17002,"As to this, she had also received instruction, but with better results, since it was an entirely feminine affair of colored silks and feathers.",m
17003,"""I will tell you which flies to use,"" she said.",m
17004,"""And,"" said he, ""you will also have to show me how to cast.""",m
17005,"""What!"" she exclaimed, and stopped rowing, ""You don't know how to cast?""",m
17006,"""No,"" he said, ""I don't.",m
17007,I'm a dub.,m
17008,"Didn't you know that?""",m
17009,"""But,"" she protested, ""I can't teach you in a morning""--and she added mentally--""or in a whole lifetime, for that matter.""",m
17010,It was not more than a mile across the mouth of a deep bay to the brook in which they had elected to fish.,m
17011,"With no wind to object, the most dabbily propelled guide boat travels with considerable speed, and before Herring had managed to tie the flies which Phyllis had selected to his leader (with any kind of a knot) they were among the snaggy shallows of the brook's mouth.",m
17012,"The brook was known locally as Swamp Brook, its shores for a mile or more being boggy and treacherous.",m
17013,Fishermen who liked to land occasionally and cast from terra firma avoided it.,m
17014,Phyllis had selected it solely because it was the nearest brook to the camp which contained trout.,m
17015,"If she had remembered how full it was of snags, and how easily guide boats are turned turtle, she would have selected some other brook, even, if necessary, at the ""Back of beyond.""",m
17016,"It had been easy enough to propel the boat across the open waters of the lake, but to guide it clear of snags and around right-angle bends, especially when the genius of rowing demands that eyes look astern rather than ahead, was beyond her powers.",m
17017,"The boat ran into snags, poked its nose into boggy banks, turned half over, righted, rushed on, and stopped again with rude bumps.",m
17018,"Herring, that fatalistic young Bostonian, began to take an interest in his fate.",m
17019,His flies trailed in the water behind him.,m
17020,His eyes never left Phyllis's face.,m
17021,His handsome mouth was as near to smiling as it ever got.,m
17022,"""Do you,"" he said presently, ""swim as well as you row?""",m
17023,She stopped rowing; she laughed right out.,m
17024,"""Just about,"" she said.",m
17025,"""Good,"" he said seriously, ""because I'm a dub at it, and in case of an upset, I look to you.""",m
17026,"""The truth,"" said Phyllis, ""is that there's no place to swim to.",m
17027,"It's all swamp in here.""",m
17028,"""True,"" said Herring;",m
17029,"""we would have to cling to the boat and call upon Heaven to aid us.""",m
17030,"One of Herring's flies, trailing in the water, proved, at this moment, overwhelmingly attractive to a young and unsophisticated trout.",m
17031,"Herring shouted with the triumph of a schoolboy, ""I've got one,"" and sprang to his feet.",m
17032,"""Please sit down!"" said Phyllis.",m
17033,"""We almost went that time.""",m
17034,"""So we did,"" said Herring.",m
17035,"He sat down, and they almost ""went"" again.",m
17036,"""Now,"" said Phyllis, ""play him.""",m
17037,"""Play him?"" said Herring.",m
17038,"""Watch me.""",m
17039,And he began to pull strongly upon the fish.,m
17040,The fish was young and weak.,m
17041,Herring's tackle was new and strong.,m
17042,The fish dangled in mid-air over the middle of the boat.,m
17043,"""Sorry,"" said Herring, ""I can't reach him.",m
17044,"Take him off, please.""",m
17045,It has been said that Phyllis was a good sport.,m
17046,"If there was one thing she hated and feared more than another, it was a live fish.",m
17047,She reached forward; her gloved hand almost closed upon it; it gave a convulsive flop;,m
17048,"Phyllis squeaked like a mouse, threw her weight to one side, and the boat quietly upset.",m

17052,"""Yes,"" she said, ""but my feet are sinking into it--"" She tore them loose and swam.",m
17053,Herring did likewise.,m

17056,"""I never rowed a boat before and I never could stand live fish.""",m
17057,"""It was my fault,"" said Herring.",m
17058,"""Something told me to lean the opposite from the way you leaned.",m
17059,But it told me too late.,m

17066,"""My plan,"" he said, ""would be to get back into the boat and row home.",m

17095,"""You're a good sport,"" said Herring.",m
17096,"""That's what you are.""",m
17097,By dint of violent kicking and paddling with their free hands they managed to propel the guide boat from the centre of the brook to a firm-looking clump of reeds and alder roots which formed a tiny peninsula from that shore which was toward The Camp.,m

17183,"Can't you be serious about anything?""",m
17184,"""Not about a half-drowned girl taking the trouble to wash her face,"" he said.",m

17191,"M.  Greatly moved, he carried it to Gay, and without comment put it in her hand.",m
17192,"""Who is M?"" she asked.",m
17193,"""My uncle, the Earl of Merrivale.""",m
17194,"""What does _I'm off_ mean?""",m
17195,"""It means,"" said Pritchard, ""that they've given him up, and he wants to make friends.",m
17196,"He never liked my father or me.""",m
17197,"""It means,"" said Gay generously, ""that you are going away?""",m
17198,"""Yes,"" he said, ""at once.",m
17199,But it means more.,m
17200,"It means that I've got to find out if I'm--to come back some time?""",m
17201,"""Of course, you are to come back,"" she said.",m
17202,Words rose swiftly to Pritchard's lips and came no further.,m
17203,"Indeed, he appeared to swallow them.",m
17204,"""And I'm glad you are going to make friends with your uncle,"" said Gay.",m
17205,"""There'll be such lots of young men here when the season opens,"" said Pritchard.",m
17206,"""Judging by applications,"" said Gay, ""we shall be swamped with gentlemen of all ages.""",m
17207,Pritchard's melancholy only deepened.,m
17208,"""Will you come as far as Carrytown in the _Streak_?"" he asked.",m
17209,"She nodded, and said she would because she had some shopping to do.",m
17210,"During that short, exhilarating rush across the lake, and afterward walking up and down on the board platform by the side of the waiting train, he tried his best to ring a little sentiment out of her, but failed utterly.",m
17211,"The locomotive whistled, and the conductor came out of the village drug-store, staggering slightly.",m
17212,"""I've left all my dry-fly tackle,"" said Pritchard.",m
17213,"""Will _you_ take care of it for me?""",m
17214,"""With pleasure,"" said Gay.",m
17215,"""I'd like you to use it.",m

17217,"""All aboard!""",m
17218,"""I'd like to bring you out some rods and things.",m
17219,"May I?""",m
17220,"""You bet you may!"" exclaimed Gay.",m
17221,Pritchard sighed.,m
17222,"The train creaked, jolted, moved forward, stopped, jerked, and moved forward again.",m
17223,Pritchard waited until the rear steps of the rear car were about to pass.,m
17224,"""Good-by, Miss Gay!""",m
17225,"They shook hands firmly, and Pritchard swung himself onto the moving train.",m
17226,"Gay, walking rapidly and presently breaking into a trot, accompanied him as far as the end of the platform.",m
17227,She wanted to say something that would please him very much without encouraging him too much.,m
17228,"""Looks as if I was after you!"" she said.",m
17229,Pritchard's whole soul was in his eyes.,m
17230,And there was a large lump in his throat.,m
17231,Suddenly Gay reached the end of the long platform and stopped running.,m
17232,The train was now going quite fast for an Adirondack train.,m
17233,The distance between them widened rapidly.,m
17234,"""Wish you weren't going,"" called Gay.",m
17235,And she saw Pritchard reach suddenly upward and pull the rope by which trains are stopped in emergencies.,m
17236,"While the train was stopping and the train hands were trying to find out who had stopped it and why, Pritchard calmly alighted, and returned to where Gay was standing.",m
17237,"""I just had to look at you once more--close,"" he said;",m
17238,"""you never can tell what will happen in this world.",m
17239,"I may never see you again, and the thought is killing me.",m
17240,"Think of that once in a while, please.""",m
17241,"He bent swiftly, caught her hand in his, kissed it, and was gone.",m
17242,"Or, if not exactly gone, she saw him no more, because of suddenly blinding tears.",m
17243,"When she reached The Camp, Arthur was at the float to meet her.",m
17244,"""Phyllis and Herring haven't come back,"" he said.",m
17245,"""Lee says they went fishing.",m
17246,"Do you know where they went?""",m
17247,"""I don't.",m
17248,"And they ought to have been back hours ago.""",m
17249,"""Yes,"" said Arthur, ""and we're all starting out to look for them.",m
17250,"Care to come with me?""",m
17251,"""Yes,"" she said;",m
17252,"""I've got to do _something_.""",m
17253,Something in her voice took his mind from the more imminent matter.,m
17254,"""What's wrong, Gay?""",m
17255,She shook her head.,m
17256,"""Nothing.",m
17257,Let's start.,m
17258,"If Phyl rowed, they must have gone to the nearest possible fishing grounds.""",m
17259,At this moment Sam Langham came puffing down from Cook House.,m
17260,He was dressed in white flannels and carried a revolver.,m
17261,"""It's to signal with,"" he explained.",m
17262,"""I'm going to try Loon Brook, because it's the only brook I know when I see it.""",m
17263,"""Bullard's gone to Loon Brook.""",m
17264,"""Pshaw--can't I ever be of any use!""",m
17265,"""Good Lord,"" said Gay, ""look!""",m
17266,"There came around the nearest bend a man rowing one guide boat and towing another, which was empty.",m
17267,"Arthur called to him in a loud, hoarse voice:  ""Where'd you find that boat?""",m
17268,"""Up Swamp Brook,"" came the answer.",m
17269,Arthur and Gay went gray as ashes.,m
17270,"""Who's to tell Mary?"" said Arthur presently.",m
17271,Then Sam Langham spoke.,m
17272,"""If you don't mind,"" he said, ""I think I will.""",m
17273,An hour later the entire male population of The Camp was dragging Swamp Brook for what they so dreaded to find.,m
17274,XV   It wasn't all discouragement.,m
17275,For now and then it seemed as if the swamp was going to have a shore of dry land.,m
17276,"At such times Herring would exclaim:  ""There you see!",m
17277,"It had never been done before, and now it's been done, and we've done it.""",m
17278,And then it would seem to Phyllis as if a great weight of fear and anxiety had been lifted from her.,m
17279,But the shore of the swamp always turned out to be an illusion.,m
17280,"Once Herring, firmly situated as he believed, went suddenly through a crust of sphagnum moss and was immersed to the arm-pits.",m
17281,"For some moments he struggled grimly to extricate himself, and only sank the deeper.",m
17282,"Then he turned to Phyllis a face whimsical in spite of its gravity and pallor, and said: ""If you have never saved a man's life, now is your chance.",m
17283,"I'm afraid I can't get out without help.""",m
17284,It was then that her phenomenally strong little hands and wrists stood them both in good stead.,m
17285,"The arches of her feet against a submerged root of white cedar, she so pulled and tugged, and exhorted Herring to struggle free, that at last he came out of that pocket quagmire and lay exhausted in the ooze at her feet.",m
17286,He was incased from neck to foot in a smooth coating of brown slime.,m
17287,Presently he rolled over on his back and looked up at her.,m
17288,"""There you see!"" he said.",m
17289,"""You'd never saved a man's life before, and now you've done it.",m
17290,"Please accept my sincere expressions of envy and gratitude-- Why, you're crying!""",m
17291,"She was not only crying, but she was showing symptoms of incipient hysteria.",m
17292,"""An old-fashioned girl,"" thought Herring, ""like Great-grandmother Saltonstall.""",m
17293,"He raised himself to a sitting position just in time to slide an arm around her waist as, the hysteria now well under way, she sat down beside him and began to wave her hands up and down like a polite baby saying good-by to some one.",m
17294,"""One new thing under the sun after another,"" thought Herring.",m
17295,"""Never had arm round hysterical girl's waist before.",m
17296,Got it there now.,m
17297,"When you need _her_, she takes a good brace and pulls for all she's worth.",m
17298,"When she needs _you_, she seats herself on six inches of water and yells.",m
17299,"Just like Great-grandmother Saltonstall.""",m
17300,"Aloud he kept saying: ""That's right!",m
17301,Greatest relief in the world!,m
17302,"Go to it!""",m
17303,And his arm tightened about her with extraordinary tenderness.,m
17304,Her hysterics ended as suddenly as they had begun.,m
17305,And then she wasted a valuable half-hour apologizing for having had them;,m
17306,"Herring protesting all the while that he had enjoyed them just as much as she had, and that they had done him a world of good.",m
17307,And then they had to stop talking because their teeth began to chatter so hard that they simply couldn't keep on.,m
17308,"Herring stuttered something about, ""Exercise is what a body needs,"" and they rose to their feet and fought their way through a dense grove of arbor-vitae.",m
17309,"""The stealthy Indian goes through such places without making a sound,"" said Herring.",m
17310,"""Or getting his moccasins wet,"" said Phyllis.",m
17311,"""Oh!""",m
17312,And she sank to the waist.,m
17313,"""Never mind,"" said Herring, ""it will be dark before long.",m
17314,"And when we have no choice of where to step, maybe we'll have better luck.""",m
17315,"""It will _have_ to be dark very soon,"" said Phyllis, ""if we have any more of our clothes taken away from us by the brambles.""",m
17316,"""That's a new idea!"" exclaimed Herring.",m
17317,"""Young couple starve to death in the woods because modesty forbids them to join their friends in the open.",m
17318,"The head-line might be: 'Stripped by Brambles,' or 'The Two Bares.'""  He was so pleased with his joke that he had to lean against a tree.",m
17319,"The laughing set him to coughing, and Phyllis beat him methodically between the shoulders.",m
17320,Herring still refused to be serious.,m
17321,"In helping Phyllis over the bad places, he performed prodigies of misapplied strength and made prodigious puns.",m
17322,And he said that never in his life had he been in such a delightful scrape.,m
17323,"Once, while they were resting, Phyllis said:  ""All you seem to think of is the fun you're having.",m
17324,"Most men would be thinking about the anxiety they were causing others and about the miseries of their companion.""",m
17325,"""But,"" he protested, ""you are enjoying yourself too.",m
17326,"You don't think you are, but you are.",m
17327,It's your philosophy that is wrong.,m
17328,You like to live too much in the present.,m
17329,I like to lay by stores of delightful memories against rainy days.,m
17330,"The worse you feel now, the more you'll enjoy remembering how you felt--some evening, soon--your back against soft cushions and the soles of your feet toward the fire.""",m
17331,"""Ugh!"" shuddered Phyllis.",m
17332,"""Don't talk about fires.",m
17333,"Oh, dear!""",m
17334,"""What's wrong _now_!""",m
17335,"""I'm so stiff I don't think I can take another step.",m
17336,"We oughtn't to have rested so long.""",m
17337,"But she did take another step, and would have fallen heavily if Herring had not caught her.",m
17338,"A moment later she lost a shoe in the ooze, and wasted much precious daylight in vain efforts to locate and recover it.",m
17339,"""Sit down on that root,"" commanded Herring.",m
17340,And she obeyed.,m
17341,"He knelt before her, lifted her wet, muddy little stockinged foot and set it on his knee.",m
17342,"""What size, please, miss?"" he asked, giving an excellent imitation of a somewhat officious salesman.",m
17343,"""I don't know;",m
17344,"I have them made,"" said Phyllis wearily, but trying her best to smile.",m
17345,"""Something in this style?"" suggested Herring.",m
17346,"He had secretly removed one of his own shoes, and handling it with a kind of comic reverence, as if the soggy, muddy thing was a precious work of art, he presented it to her attention.",m
17347,And then Phyllis smiled without even trying and then laughed.,m
17348,"""I said a _shoe_,"" she said, ""not a travelling bath-tub.""",m
17349,"But he slipped that great shoe over her little foot, and so bound it to her ankle with his handkerchief and necktie that it promised to stay on.",m
17350,"""But you?"" she said.",m
17351,"""Luck is with me to-day,"" said Herring.",m
17352,"""Anybody can walk through an impassable swamp, but few are given the opportunity to hop.",m
17353,General Sherman should have thought of that.,m
17354,"It would have showed the Confederates just what he thought of them if instead of marching through Georgia he had hopped.""",m
17355,And he pursued this new train of thought for some time.,m
17356,"He improvised words to old tunes, and sang them at the top of his lungs: ""As we were hopping through Georgia.""",m
17357,"And last and worst he sang: ""There'll be a hop time in the old town to-night.""",m
17358,"And when he had occasion to address Phyllis directly, he no longer called her Miss Darling, but ""Goody Two Shoes.""",m
17359,"He said that his own name was not Mr. Herring but Mr. Hopper, and that he was a famous cotillon leader.",m
17360,"But even he became a little quiet when the light began to fail, and a little serious.",m
17361,"""Whatever happens,"" he said, ""it will be a great comfort to you to realize that it's entirely my fault.",m
17362,"On the other hand, if we had gotten back into that boat, we might have been drowned long before this.""",m
17363,"A little later Phyllis said: ""I'm about all in.",m

17374,"""Never.""",m
17375,"""Well, try it.",m

17377,"Afterward we will play 'Paddy cake, Paddy cake,' and 'Bean Porridge hot.'""  ""Do men in danger always carry on the way you do?"" asked Phyllis.",m
17378,"""Always,"" he answered.",m

17381,"""Half the inhabitants of that municipality freeze to death and the others burn.""",m
17382,"""I've stayed in Boston,"" said Phyllis, ""and the only difference that I could see between it and other places was that the people were more agreeable and things were done in better taste.",m
17383,"And what gardens!""",m
17384,"""Ever seen the Arboretum?""",m
17385,"""Have I?""",m
17386,"""In lilac time?""",m
17387,"""Mm!""",m
17388,She was on her favorite topic.,m

17450,"He shouted in a voice of thunder, and before the echo came back to them another voice, loud and excited, rose in the forest.",m
17451,"And they heard smashings and crashings, as a wild bull tearing through brittle bushes.",m
17452,And presently Sam Langham burst out of the thicket with a shower of twigs and pine-needles.,m
17453,His delight was not to be measured in words.,m
17454,He apostrophized himself.,m
17455,"""Good old Sam!"" he said.",m
17456,"""He knew you weren't drowned in the brook.",m
17457,He knew it would be just like Herring to want to cross that swamp.,m
17458,"As soon as I heard somebody say that it was impassable, I said: 'Where is the other side?",m
17459,That's the place to look for them.',m
17460,"But why didn't you make more noise?""",m
17461,"""Oh,"" said Herring, ""we were so busy talking and exploring and doing things that had never been done before that it never occurred to us to shout.""",m
17462,"""Herring,"" said Langham sternly, ""you have the makings of a hero, but not, I am afraid, of a woodsman.""",m
17463,"""Well, we're safe enough now,"" said Herring.",m
17464,"""Excuse me a moment----""  ""Excuse you!",m
17465,"What?""",m
17466,"""It's very silly--been sick you know--over-exertion--think better faint and get it over with.""",m
17467,Langham knelt and lifted Herring's head.,m
17468,"""You lift his feet,"" he said to Phyllis, ""send the blood to his heart; bring him to.""",m
17469,Herring began to come out of his faint.,m
17470,"""This young man,"" said Langham, ""may be something of an ass, but he's got sand.""",m
17471,"""He carried me a long way,"" said Phyllis, the tears racing down her cheeks;",m
17472,"""and he's only just over typhoid, and he never stopped being cheerful and gallant, and he _isn't_ an ass!""",m
17473,"Herring came to, but was not able to stand.",m
17474,"He had kept up as long as he had to, and now there was no more strength in him.",m
17475,Phyllis accepted the loan of Langham's coat.,m
17476,"""I'll stay with him,"" she said, ""while you go for help.""",m
17477,The moment Langham's back was turned she spread the coat over Herring.,m
17478,"""_Please--don't!_"" he said.",m
17479,"""You be quiet,"" said she sharply.",m
17480,"""How do you feel?""",m
17481,"""Pretty well used up, thank you.",m
17482,Hope you'll 'scuse me for this collapse.,m
17483,Shan't happen again.,m
17484,"Lucky thing you and I don't both collapse same moment.""",m
17485,A faint moan was wrung from him.,m
17486,She touched his cheek with her hand.,m
17487,It was hot as fire.,m
17488,"She was an old-fashioned girl, and the instinct of nursing was strong in her.",m
17489,She was an old-fashioned girl.,m
17490,"There had almost always been a young man in her life about whom, for a while, she wove more or less intensely romantic fancies.",m
17491,They came; they went.,m
17492,But almost always there was one.,m
17493,"She raised her lovely face and looked at the moon, and made an unspoken confession.",m
17494,There had always been one.,m
17495,"Well, now there was another!",m
17496,"XVI   When the real season opened, you might have thought that the whole venture was Mr. Sam Langham's and that he had risked the whole of his money in it.",m
17497,"Without being officious, he had words of anxious advice for the Darlings, severally and collectively.",m
17498,"His early breakfasts in Smoke House with Mary, the chef beaming upon the efficient and friendly pair, lost something of their free and easy social quality, and became opportunities for the gravest discussions of ways and means.",m
17499,The opening day would see every spare room in the place occupied--by a man.,m
17500,"To Mary it seemed a little curious that so few women, so few families, and so many bachelors had applied for rooms.",m
17501,But to Sam Langham the reasons for this were clear and definite.,m
17502,"""It was the picture in the first issues of your advertisement that did it.",m
17503,I only compliment and felicitate you when I say that every bachelor who saw that picture must have made up his mind to come here if he possibly could.,m
17504,And that every woman who saw it must have felt that she could spend a happier summer somewhere else.,m
17505,"Now, if you had circulated a picture of half a dozen men, each as good-looking as your brother Arthur, the results would have been just the opposite.""",m
17506,"""Women aren't such idiots about other women's looks as you think they are,"" said Mary.",m
17507,"""I didn't say they were idiots;",m
17508,I intimated that they were sensible.,m
17509,"The prettiest woman at a summer resort always has a good time--not the best, necessarily, but very good.",m
17510,"Now, no woman could look at that picture of you and your sisters and expect to be considered the prettiest woman _here_.",m
17511,"Could she, Chef?""",m
17512,"Chef laughed a loud, scornful, defiant, gesticulant, Gallic laugh.",m
17513,"His good-natured features focussed into a scathing Parisian sneer; he turned a delicate omelette over in the air and said, ""Lala!""",m
17514,"""There are,"" continued Mr. Langham, ""only half a dozen women in the world who can compare in looks with you and your sisters.",m
17515,There's the Princess Oducalchi--your mother.,m
17516,"There's the Countess of Kingston, Mrs. Waring, Miss Virginia Clark--but these merely compare.",m
17517,"They don't compete.""",m
17518,"Mr. Langham tried to look very sly and wicked, and he sang in a humming voice: ""Oh, to be a Mussulman, now that spring is here.""",m
17519,"""Coffee?"" said Mary.",m
17520,"""Please.""",m
17521,"""Well,"" said she, as she poured, ""the whys and wherefores don't matter.",m
17522,It's to be a bachelor resort--that seems definitely settled.,m
17523,But I think we had better send the triplets away.,m
17524,I don't want the Pritchard and Herring episodes repeated while my nerves are in this present state.,m
17525,"And there's Lee--if she isn't leading Renier into one folly after another, I don't know what she is doing.",m
17526,"They seem to think that keeping an inn is a mere excuse for flirtation.""",m
17527,"""Don't send them away,"" said Langham.",m
17528,"""If you sent those three girls to a place where there weren't any men at all--they'd flirt with their shadows.",m
17529,Better have 'em flirting where you can watch 'em than where you can't.,m
17530,And besides--are you quite sure that the Pritchard and Herring episodes were mere flirtations?,m
17531,"Day before yesterday I came upon Miss Gay by accident; she was practising casting.""",m
17532,"""That's how she spends half her time.""",m
17533,"""But she was practising with Pritchard's rod!",m
17534,"Yesterday I came upon her in the same place----""  ""By accident?"" smiled Mary.",m
17535,"""By design,"" he said honestly.",m
17536,"""And this time she wasn't casting.",m
17537,"She had the rod lying across her knees, and her eyes were turned dreamily toward the bluest and most distant mountain-top.""",m
17538,"""'Why do you look at that mountain?'",m
17539,I said.,m
17540,"""'Because it's blue, too,' said she.",m
17541,"""'And what makes you blue?'",m
17542,I asked.,m
17543,"""'The same cause that makes the mountain blue,' said she.",m
17544,"""'Hum,' said I. 'Then it must be distance.'",m
17545,"""'Something like that,' she said.",m
17546,'I sometimes think I'm the most distant person in the world.',m
17547,"""'You're probably not the only person who thinks that!' said I.  ""And she said, 'No?",m
17548,Really?',m
17549,And that was all I could get out of her.,m
17550,"Except that, just as I was walking away, I heard a sharp whistling sound and my cap--my new plaid cap--was suddenly tweaked from the top of my head and hung in a tree.",m
17551,She must have practised a lot with that rod of Pritchard's.,m
17552,"It was a beautiful cast----""  ""She might have put your eye out!"" exclaimed Mary.",m
17553,"""She hung the apple of my eye in a tree,"" said he dolefully.",m
17554,"""You know that one with the green and brown?",m
17555,"And last night it rained.""",m
17556,"""I hope she expressed sorrow,"" said Mary.",m
17557,"""She was going to, but I got laughing and then she did.""",m
17558,"""What a dear you are!"" exclaimed Mary.",m
17559,"""And so you think she's making herself mournful over Mr. Pritchard?",m
17560,"And what are the reasons for thinking that Phyllis is serious about Mr. Herring?""",m
17561,"""He's sent for blue-prints of his property outside Boston, and they are busy with plans for landscaping it.",m
17562,Narrow escape that!,m
17563,I didn't let on; but the second day I thought he was a goner.,m
17564,"I did.""",m
17565,Mary sighed.,m
17566,"""We might just as well have called it a matrimonial agency in the first place instead of an inn.""",m
17567,Mr. Langham rose reluctantly.,m
17568,"""I have an engagement with Miss Maud,"" he explained.",m
17569,The faintest ripple of disappointment flitted across Mary's forehead.,m
17570,"""I've promised to help her with her books,"" said he.",m
17571,"""Some of the journal entries puzzle her; and she has an idea that The Inn ought to have more capital.",m
17572,"And we are going into that, too.""",m
17573,"""I hope,"" said Mary, ""that you aren't going to lend us money without consulting me.""",m
17574,"Chef was in a distant corner, quite out of ear-shot.",m
17575,"And Mr. Langham, emboldened by one of the most delicious breakfasts he had ever eaten, shot an arch glance at Miss Darling.",m
17576,"""I wouldn't consult you about lending money,"" he said;",m
17577,"""I wouldn't consult you about giving money.",m
17578,"But any time you'll let me consult you about _sharing_ money----""  Panic overtook him, and he turned and fled.",m
17579,But upon Mary's brow was no longer any ripple of disappointment--only the unbroken alabaster of smooth serenity.,m
17580,"She reached for the household keys and said to herself:  ""Maud is a steady girl--even if the rest of us aren't.""",m
17581,She caught a glimpse of herself in the bottom of a highly polished copper utensil and couldn't help being pleased with what she saw.,m
17582,On the way to the office Mr. Langham fell in with Arthur.,m
17583,"This one, Uncas scolding and chatting upon his shoulder, was starting off for a day's botanizing--or dreaming maybe.",m
17584,"""Arthur--one moment, please,"" said Langham.",m
17585,"""As the head of the family I want to consult you about something.""",m
17586,"""Yes?"" said Arthur sweetly.",m
17587,"""Of course, Uncas, you are too noisy.""",m
17588,And he put the offended little beast into his green collecting case.,m
17589,"""I never would have come here,"" said Mr. Langham, ""if it hadn't been for that advertisement.""",m
17590,Arthur frowned slightly.,m
17591,"""You mean----""  ""Yes.",m
17592,"But I came,"" said Mr. Langham, ""not as a pagan Turk but as a Christian gentleman.",m
17593,I was just about to take passage for Liverpool when I saw your sister Mary looking out at me from _The Four Seasons_.,m
17594,And so I wrote to ask if I could come here.,m
17595,"I have lived well, but I am not disappointed.",m
17596,"I am very rich----""  ""My dear Sam,"" said Arthur, ""you are the best fellow in the world.",m
17597,"What do you want of me?""",m
17598,"""To know that you think I'd try my best to make a girl happy if she'd let me.""",m
17599,"""A girl?"" smiled Arthur.",m
17600,"""_Any_ girl?""",m
17601,"""In all the world,"" said Mr. Langham, ""there is only one girl.""",m
17602,"""If I were you,"" said Arthur, ""I'd ask her what _she_ thought about it.""",m
17603,Langham assumed a look of terrible gloom.,m
17604,"""If she didn't think well of it I'd want to cut my throat.",m
17605,"I'd rather keep on living in blissful uncertainty, but I wanted _you_ to know--_why_ I am here, and _why_ I want to stay on and on.""",m
17606,"""Why, I'm very glad to know,"" said Arthur, ""but surely it's your own affair.""",m
17607,Mr. Langham shook his head.,m
17608,"""Last night,"" said he, ""I was dozing on my little piazza.",m
17609,Who should row by at a distance but Miss Gay and Miss Lee.,m
17610,You know how sounds carry through an Adirondack night?,m
17611,Miss Lee said to Miss Gay: 'I tell you he doesn't.,m
17612,Not _really_.,m
17613,He's just a male flirt.',m
17614,"'A butterfly,' said Miss Gay.""",m
17615,"""But how do you know they were referring to you?""",m
17616,"""By the way the blessed young things laughed at the word '_butterfly_'.",m
17617,"So I wanted you to know that my intentions are tragically serious, no matter what others may say.",m
17618,"Whatever I may be, and I have been insulted more than once about my figure and my habits, I am _not_ a flirt.",m
17619,"I am just as romantic as if I was a living skeleton.""",m
17620,"Here Arthur's head went back, and he laughed till the tears came.",m
17621,"And Mr. Langham couldn't help laughing, too.",m
17622,A few moments later he was going over The Inn books with Maud Darling and displaying for her edification an astonishing knowledge of entries and a truly magical facility in figuring.,m
17623,"Suddenly, apropos of something not in the least germane, he said:  ""Miss Maud, when in your opinion is the most opportune time for a man to propose to a girl?""",m
17624,"""When he's got her alone,"" said she promptly, ""and has just been dazzling her with a display of his erudition and understanding.""",m
17625,"And she, whom Mary had described as the one steady sister in the lot, flung him a melting and piercing glance.",m
17626,But Mr. Langham was not deceived.,m
17627,"""I ask you an academic question,"" he said, ""and you give me an absolutely cradle-snatching answer.",m
17628,"I may _look_ easy, Miss Maud, but there are people who will protect me.""",m
17629,"""The best time to propose to a girl?",m
17630,You really want to know?,m
17631,"I thought you were just starting one of your jokes.""",m
17632,"""If I am,"" said he, ""the joke will be on me.",m
17633,"But I _really_ want to know.""",m
17634,"""The best moment,"" said she, ""is that moment in which she learns that one of her friends or one of her sisters younger than she is engaged to be married.",m
17635,"When an unengaged girl hears of another girl's engagement she has a momentary panic, during which she is helpless and defenseless.",m
17636,"That is my best judgment, Mr. Sam Langham.",m
17637,And the older the girl the greater the panic.,m
17638,And now I've betrayed my sex.,m
17639,"In fact, I have told you absolutely all that is definitely known about girls.""",m
17640,Just outside the office he met Gay.,m
17641,"""Halloo!"" she said.",m
17642,He only made signs at her and flapped his arms up and down.,m
17643,"""_They_ can't talk,"" he said.",m
17644,"""Who can't talk?""",m
17645,"He held her with a stern glance, and if the word had been hissable, would have hissed it.",m
17646,"""Butterflies,"" he said.",m
17647,Then Miss Gay turned the color of a scarlet maple in the fall of the year.,m
17648,Then she squealed and ran.,m
17649,"XVII   ""Are we all here?"" asked Mary.",m
17650,She had summoned her sisters and Arthur to the office for a conference.,m
17651,"""All except Sam Langham,"" said Gay.",m
17652,"""I didn't know that he was one of the family,"" said Mary.",m
17653,"""Of course, you _know_,"" said Gay;",m
17654,"""you would.",m
17655,"_I_ was just guessing.""",m
17656,"""Well, he isn't,"" said Mary, trying not to change color or to enjoy being teased about Mr. Langham.",m
17657,The triplets sat in a row upon a bench made of little birch logs with the bark on.,m
17658,"It was not soft sitting, as Lee whispered, but one had one's back to the light, and in case one had done something wrong without knowing it and was in for a scolding, that would prove an immense advantage.",m
17659,"""What I wanted to say,"" said Mary, ""is just this----""  She stood up and looked rather more at the triplets than any one else, so that Lee exclaimed, ""Votes for women,"" and Gay echoed her with, ""Yes, but none for poor little girls in their teens.""",m
17660,"""Hitherto,"" continued the orator, ""The Inn has been only informally open.",m
17661,It's been more like having a few friends stopping with us.,m
17662,We had to see more or less of them.,m
17663,"But after to-day there will be a crowd, and I think it would be more dignified and pleasanter for them if _some_ of us kept ourselves a little more to ourselves.",m
17664,"What do _you_ think, Arthur?""",m
17665,Arthur looked up sweetly.,m
17666,It was evident that he had not been listening.,m
17667,"""Why, Mary,"" he said, ""I think it might be managed with infinite patience.""",m
17668,The triplets giggled;,m
17669,Maud and Eve exchanged amused looks.,m

17672,"""Why,"" said he gently, ""you know I have quite a knack with animals, taming them and training them, and I was wondering if it would be possible to train a snail.",m
17673,_That's_ what I was thinking about.,m

17675,"""What do _you_ think of what I said?""",m
17676,"""I think it was tortuous and involved,"" said Lee, ""and that it would hardly bear repetition.""",m
17677,"""It smacked of paternalism,"" said Gay.",m
17678,"And even Phyllis, her mind upon the convalescing Herring, was moved to speak.",m
17679,"""You said it would be more dignified for some of us to keep to ourselves.",m
17680,Perhaps it would.,m

17683,"""Bully for you, old girl,"" shouted Lee and Gay;",m
17684,"""sick her!""",m
17685,Mary moaned.,m
17686,"She was proof against their hostilities, but the language in which they were couched pierced her to the marrow.",m

17691,"""We agree,"" said Eve, ""that _some_ of us should keep ourselves more to ourselves.""",m

17765,"""It is,"" said Mary, and, after a moment's hesitation, she boldly joined Mr. Langham and walked off by his side.",m
17766,Even Arthur chuckled.,m
17767,"""And what was the meeting about?"" asked Mr. Langham.",m
17768,"""Oh,"" said Mary, ""they won't be serious--not any of them--not even Arthur.",m
17769,"So we forgot what the meeting was for, and got into violent discussion about--about natural history.""",m
17770,"""And what side did you take?""",m
17771,"""Oh,"" said Mary, ""we were all on the same side--_really_, and that was what made the discussion so violent.""",m
17772,"""The day,"" said Langham, ""is young.",m
17773,I feel ripe for an adventure.,m
17774,"And you?""",m
17775,"""What sort of an adventure?""",m
17776,"""I thought that if one--or rather if _two_ climbed to the top of a very little hill and sat down in the sunshine and admired the view----""         *       *       *       *       *  Far out on the lake they could see Lee, lolling in the stern of a guide boat.",m
17777,Young Renier was at the oars.,m
17778,But the boat was not being propelled.,m
17779,It was merely drifting.,m
17780,"""I wonder,"" said Langham, and he watched her face stealthily, ""if by any chance those two are really engaged?""",m
17781,"Was there the least hardening of that lovely, gentle face, the least fleeting expression of that sort of panic which one experiences when arriving at the station in time to see the train pull out but not too late to get aboard by the exercise of swift and energetic manoeuvres?",m
17782,"""Don't say such things!"" she said presently.",m
17783,"""It's like jumping out from behind a tree and shouting, 'Boo!'""  Mr. Langham smiled complacently and changed the subject.",m
17784,"But he said to himself: ""That Maud is a clever girl!""",m
17785,"""I suppose,"" said Mary after a while, ""that this is the last really peaceful day we'll have for a long time.",m
17786,"To-morrow the place will be full of strange, critical faces.",m
17787,"And it will be one long wrestle to make everything go smoothly all the time.""",m
17788,She sighed.,m
17789,"""There are only two ways to success,"" said Langham.",m
17790,"""One is across the wrestling-mat, and one is through the pasture of old Bull Luck.",m
17791,But I'm convinced that The Inn is going to pay very handsomely.,m
17792,"There is a fortune in it.""",m
17793,"""There mightn't be,"" said Mary, ""if--"" and she broke into a peal of embarrassed laughter.",m
17794,"""If what?""",m
17795,"""I was thinking of that _dreadful_ picture.""",m
17796,"""I often think of it,"" said Mr. Langham, ""and of the first time I saw it.""",m
17797,Mary gave him a somewhat shy look.,m
17798,"""Of course it didn't influence you,"" she said.",m
17799,"""But it did.",m
17800,And that day I forgot to eat any lunch.,m
17801,"I am looking forward,"" he said, ""to warm weather--I enjoy a swim as much as anybody.""",m
17802,"""Why is it,"" said Mary, ""that a girl is ashamed when it is her money that attracts a man, and proud when it is her face?",m
17803,"Both are equally fortuitous; both are assets in a way--but of the two, it is the money alone which is really useful.""",m
17804,"""It sounds convincing to a girl,"" mused Mr. Langham, ""when a man says to her: 'I love you because of your beautiful blue eyes!'",m
17805,But it wouldn't sound in the least convincing if he said: 'I love you because of your beautiful green money!',m
17806,I don't attempt to explain this.,m
17807,I am merely stating what appears to me to be a fact.,m
17808,"But, as you say, money is, or should be, an asset of attraction.""",m
17809,"""I suppose beauty is held in greater esteem,"" said Mary, ""because it is more democratically bestowed.",m
17810,"Money seems to beget hatred because it isn't.""",m
17811,"""The French people,"" said Langham, ""hated the nobility because of their wealth and luxury.",m
17812,"To-day a common mechanic has more real luxuries at his disposal than poor Louis XVI had, but he hates the rich people who have more than he has--and so it will go on to the end of time.""",m
17813,"""Will there always be rich people and poor people?""",m
17814,"""There will always be rich people, but some time they will learn to spend their money more beneficently, and then there won't be any really poor people.",m
17815,If the attic of your house were infected with dirt and vermin you couldn't sleep until it had been cleaned and disinfected.,m
17816,"So, some day, rich men will feel about their neighbors; cities about their slums; and nations about other nations.",m

17818,Bother the interest!',m
17819,What a spectacle this world is--it's like the old English schools that Dickens wrote out of existence--just bullying and hazing all around!,m
17820,"Why, if a country was run on the most elementary principles of honesty and efficiency, the citizens of that country would never have occasion to say: 'Our taxes are almost unbearable.'",m
17821,"They would be nudging each other in the streets and saying: 'My, that was a big dividend we got!'""  Mr. Langham only stopped because he was out of breath.",m
17822,His face was red and shining.,m
17823,He mopped his brow with his handkerchief.,m
17824,Mary was almost perfectly happy.,m
17825,She loved to hear Langham run on and on.,m
17826,"His voice was so pleasant, and his face beamed so with kindness.",m
17827,And from many things which he had from time to time let slip she was convinced that she needn't be an old maid unless she wanted to be.,m
17828,"And so to climb a little hill with him, to sit in the sun, and to admire the view was really an exciting venture.",m
17829,For she never knew what he was going to let slip next.,m
17830,"And equally exciting was the fact that if that slip should be in the nature of a leading question, she could only guess what her answer would be.",m
17831,"When a man is offered something that he very much wants--a trifling loan, for instance--his first instinct is to deny the need.",m
17832,"And a girl, when the man she wants offers himself, usually refuses at the first time of asking.",m
17833,"And some, especially rich in girl nature, which is experience of human nature and somewhat short of divine, will persist in refusing even unto the twentieth and thirtieth time.",m
17834,Mary Darling was in a deep reverie.,m
17835,"From this, his eyes twinkling behind their thick glasses, Mr. Langham roused her with the brisk utterance of one of his favorite quotations:  ""'General Blank's compliments,'"" said he, ""'and he reports that the colored troops are turning black in the face.'""  Mary smiled her friendliest smile.",m
17836,"""I was wondering,"" she said, ""what had become of Lee and Renier.""",m
17837,"""I have noted,"" said Mr. Langham, ""that she always calls him by his last name, sometimes with the prefix you--'You Renier' put like that.",m
17838,"And I was wondering if he ever turns the trick on her.""",m
17839,"""Why should he?"" asked Mary innocently.",m
17840,"""You have forgotten,"" said he, ""that her last name is Darling.""",m
17841,His eyes twinkled with amazing and playful boldness.,m
17842,"""You're _all_ Darlings,"" he exclaimed, ""and""--a note of self-pity in his voice--""I'm just a fat old stuff!""",m
17843,"""That,"" said Mary primly, ""is perfectly correct, but for three trifling errors--you're not fat, you're not old, and you're not a stuff!""",m
17844,If she had told him that he was handsome as Apollo he could not have been more pleased.,m
17845,And so their adventure progressed in the pleasant sunlight that warmed the top of the little hill.,m
17846,"No very exciting adventure, you say?",m
17847,And of a shilly-shallying and even snail-like motion?,m
17848,"Oh, you can't be always riding to rescues, and falling over cliffs, and escaping from burning houses.",m
17849,"At that moment, by the purest accident, the tip of Mr. Langham's right forefinger just brushed against Mary's sleeve.",m
17850,"And there went through him from head to foot a great thrill, as if trumpets had suddenly sounded.",m
17851,"""I suppose,"" said Mary, after a little while, ""that we ought to be going.""",m
17852,"""But I'd rather sit here than eat,"" said Mr. Langham.",m
17853,"""Honestly?",m
17854,"So would I.""",m
17855,"""Then,"" said Mr. Langham, ""without exposing ourselves to any other danger than that of starvation, I propose that we lose ourselves--as _other people do_--in short, that we remain here until one or other of us would rather--eat.""",m
17856,"""Good gracious,"" said Mary, ""we might be here a week!""",m
17857,Mr. Langham rose slowly to his feet.,m
17858,Far off he could see pale smoke flitting upward through the tree-tops.,m
17859,"He turned and looked into Miss Darling's smiling, upturned face.",m
17860,"""I'll just run down and tell Arthur we're not _really_ lost,"" he said.",m
17861,"""But I'll make him promise not to look for us.",m
17862,"I'll be right back--almost before you can say 'Jack Robinson.'""  She held out her hands.",m
17863,He took them and helped her to her feet.,m
17864,And then they both laughed aloud.,m
17865,"""Thank Heaven,"" said Mary, ""that whatever else you and I may suffer from, it isn't from insanity--or slim appetites!",m
17866,"As a matter of fact, I'm famished.""",m
17867,"""Thank God!"" said Mr. Langham;",m
17868,"""so am I.""",m
17869,And they began to descend the hill.,m
17870,"For to keep men and women and adventurers going, the essential thing is food.",m
17871,And there's many a promising romance that has come to nothing for want of a loaf of bread and a jug of wine.,m

18039,Jonstone took the magazine and saw the six Darling sisters sitting on the float in their bathing-dresses.,m

18041,"""How's that?""",m
18042,"""Why, in the South there wouldn't be so many of them--but maybe they are not always there.",m
18043,"Maybe they were only there last summer.""",m
18044,"""Well, we can find out where they've gone, can't we?""",m
18045,"""It doesn't seem in strict good breeding to pursue ladies one doesn't know.""",m
18046,"""Why, bless you, I chased all over Europe after a face I saw in _The Sketch_, only to find out that she was willing to marry anybody with money and had a voice like a guinea-hen.",m
18047,"And after I'd found that out, she chased _me_ all over Europe and as far East as Cairo.""",m
18048,"""I've never been chased by a woman,"" said Jonstone a little wistfully.",m
18049,"""What happened in the end?""",m
18050,"""I left Cairo between two days, fled away into the desert with some people just stepped out of the Bible, and never came back.""",m
18051,"""Suppose she hadn't been willing to marry you and had had a voice like a dove?""",m
18052,"""Don't suppose.",m
18053,"We are on a new quest.""",m
18054,"""What is the Adirondacks?""",m
18055,"""We wouldn't think much of it in the South.",m
18056,It's a place where you are always cool and clean and can drink the nearest water.,m
18057,"The trout don't eat mud and haven't got long white whiskers, and the deer are bigger than dogs, and you don't go to sleep at night.",m
18058,The night just comes and puts you to sleep.,m
18059,"It's just like Bar Harbor--only a little more so in some ways and a little less so in others.""",m
18060,Jonstone spread _The Four Seasons_ wide open upon his knees.,m
18061,"""Let's agree right now,"" he said, ""which each of us thinks is the prettiest.",m
18062,"It would be dreadful after travelling so far if we were both to pick on the same one.""",m
18063,"""We would have to fight a duel,"" said Meredith, ""with swords, and considering that you could never even sharpen a pencil without cutting yourself----""  ""A boy wouldn't come along,"" said Jonstone, ""and sell us a copy of a magazine months old if fate hadn't meant us to see this picture.",m
18064,"I think I like the third one from the end.""",m

18067,"You never seem to remember that you are a Christian gentleman.""",m
18068,"XIX   When they found out how much the buried silver was worth--the inventory was very thorough in the matter of description, dates, and weights--Mr. Bob Jonstone burst out laughing.",m
18069,"But Colonel Meredith, although determined to stand by his bargain whatever the cash cost, looked like a man who has just missed the last train.",m
18070,"""I haven't got that much money loose, Bob,"" he said, ""but I can raise it in a few days and then we'll execute a bill of sale.",m

18072,"""Aristocracy?",m
18073,"It's blood that counts--not money.""",m
18074,"""According to the old democracy, yes.",m

18081,"Thank the Lord you're a gentleman, so there's no danger of your backing out.""",m
18082,Jonstone seized his cousin's hand and pressed it affectionately.,m
18083,"""Mel,"" he said, ""can you afford to do this thing?",m
18084,God knows the money will make all the difference in the world to me!,m
18085,"But in taking it I don't feel any too noble.""",m
18086,"""It was always ridiculous for me to be rich and for you to be poor.",m

18093,Their first day in New York was immensely amusing to both of them.,m
18094,Meredith was coming back to it after a long absence;,m
18095,"Jonstone was seeing it for the first time, and for the first time his pockets were full of money that he did not owe.",m
18096,"Now, New York is one of the finest summer resorts in the world.",m
18097,"Do not pity the poor business man who sends his family to the mountains for the hot weather, for while they are burned by the sun and fed an interminable succession of blueberry pies, he basks in the cool of electric fans and dines on the fat of the land.",m
18098,"His business may worry him, but there is no earthly use in his attending to it.",m
18099,That is done for him.,m
18100,He can skip away when he pleases for an afternoon's golf or tennis.,m
18101,Somebody's motor is always going somewhere where there is pleasure to be found and laughter.,m

18103,For pure torture give me a swim anywhere north of Cape Cod.,m
18104,Merely to step into such water is like having one's foot bitten off by a shark.,m
18105,"It did not take Jonstone long to acknowledge that New York is even bigger than Richmond, Virginia, and even livelier.",m
18106,"The discovery of a superannuated mosquito in his bathroom had made him feel at home, and the fact that the head bartender in the hotel, though a native of Ireland, fashioned a delicious julep.",m
18107,But his equanimity came very near to being upset in the subway.,m
18108,He felt a hand slipping into his pocket and caught it by the wrist.,m
18109,He had a grip like looped wire twisted with pinchers.,m
18110,The would-be thief uttered a startled shriek and was presently turned over to a policeman.,m
18111,All the way to the station-house Mr. Jonstone talked excitedly and triumphantly to his cousin.,m
18112,"""Yes, sir,"" he said, ""you had me groggy with your high buildings and your Aladdin-cave stores and your taxicabs and park systems.",m
18113,"But by the Everlasting, sir, this would never have happened to me south of the Mason and Dixon line.",m

18118,"""I don't get you,"" said Jonstone stiffly.",m
18119,A little later he did.,m
18120,The culprit was asked his name by a formidable desk sergeant.,m
18121,"""Stephen Breckenridge.""",m
18122,Bob Jonstone gasped.,m
18123,"""Where do you come from?""",m
18124,"""Lexington, Kentucky.""",m
18125,Colonel Meredith let forth a howl of laughter.,m
18126,"And after he had been frowned into decorum by the sergeant, he continued for a long time to look as if he was going to burst.",m
18127,For some hours Mr. Jonstone was moody and unamused.,m
18128,Then suddenly he broke into a winning smile.,m
18129,"""Mel,"" he said, ""I wouldn't have minded so much if he had been smart enough to get my money.",m

18131,XX   Mr. Langham was consulted about everything.,m
18132,And it was to him that Maud Darling took Meredith's letter asking for accommodations.,m
18133,"""We've only two rooms left,"" she said, ""and such nice people have come, or are coming, that it would be an awful pity if we had the bad luck to fill up with two men that weren't nice.",m

18135,"""Is that his letter?",m
18136,"May I look?""",m
18137,Mr. Langham read the letter through very carefully.,m
18138,"Then he said, looking at her over the tops of his thick glasses:  ""I don't know if you know it, but I have made quite a study of handwritings.",m
18139,"The writer of this letter is a gentleman--a Southern gentleman, if I am not mistaken.",m
18140,"Accepting this premise, we may assume that his friend Mr. Robert Middleton Jonstone is also a Southern gentleman.",m
18141,"Middleton, in fact, is pure South Carolinian.""",m
18142,"""But if they are from South Carolina, wouldn't our terms stagger them?",m
18143,"I've always understood that Southern gentlemen lost all their money in the war.""",m
18144,"""Nevertheless,"" said Mr. Langham, ""this is the writing of a rich man.""",m
18145,"""How _can_ you know that?""",m
18146,"""I tell you that I have made a study of handwriting.",m
18147,"It is also the writing of a horse-loving, war-loving, much-travelled man--in the late twenties.""",m
18148,"""You will tell me next that he is about five feet ten inches tall, has blue eyes, and is handsome as an angel.""",m
18149,"""You take the words out of my mouth, Miss Maud.""",m
18150,"""Tell me more.""",m
18151,She was laughing now.,m
18152,"""He is very handsome, but not as angels are--his eyes are too bold and roving.",m
18153,If he wasn't a good man he would be a very bad man.,m
18154,"There was a time, even, when strong drink appealed to him.",m
18155,He is quixotically brave and generous.,m
18156,"And I should by all means advise you to let him have his accommodations.""",m
18157,"""I can never tell when you are joking.""",m
18158,"""I was never more serious in my life.",m
18159,"Shall I tell you something else that I have deduced?""",m
18160,"""Please.""",m
18161,"""Well, then, he isn't married, Miss Maud, and he is a great catch!""",m
18162,Miss Maud blushed a trifle.,m
18163,"""I don't know if you know it,"" she said, ""but I have made a profound study of palmistry.",m
18164,"Will you lend me your hand a moment?""",m
18165,"""Very willingly.",m
18166,"And I don't care if some one were to see us.""",m
18167,She studied his palm with great sternness.,m
18168,"""I read here,"" she said, ""with regret, that you are an outrageous flirt.",m
18169,"It seems also that you are something of a fraud.""",m
18170,"""One more calumny,"" exclaimed Mr. Langham, ""and I withdraw my hand with a gesture of supreme indignation.""",m
18171,But she held him very tightly by the fingers.,m
18172,"""And this little line,"" she cried, ""tells me that you have known Colonel Meredith intimately for years and that you never studied handwriting in all your born days.""",m
18173,Mr. Langham began to chuckle all over.,m
18174,"""The next time,"" he said, ""that people tell me you are easily imposed on, I shall deny it.""",m
18175,"""You _do_ know him?""",m
18176,He blinked and nodded like a wise owl.,m
18177,"""Shall I write or telegraph?""",m
18178,"""You will use your own judgment.""",m
18179,So she did both.,m
18180,She wrote out a telegram and sent it to Carrytown in the _Streak_.,m
18181,And she tried to picture in her mind a young man who should look like an angel if his eyes weren't too bold and roving.,m
18182,Her sisters and her brother all proclaimed that Maud was a really sensible person.,m
18183,But none of them knew how really sensible she was.,m
18184,"She was, for instance, more interested in Colonel Meredith than in his cousin Mr. Jonstone, and for the simple reason that she knew the one to be rich and handsome and knew nothing whatever about the other.",m
18185,XXI   Mr. Langham was at the float to welcome the two Carolinians.,m
18186,"""You have,"" he complimented Colonel Meredith, ""once more proved the ability to land on your feet in a soft spot.",m
18187,"You will be more comfortable here, better fed, better laundered than anywhere else in the world.""",m
18188,"As they strolled from the float to the office, Mr. Jonstone looked about him a little uneasily.",m
18189,"Not one of the beautiful girls who had looked into his eyes from the page of _The Four Seasons_ was in sight, or, indeed, any girl, woman, or female of any sort whatever.",m
18190,He had led himself to expect a resort crowded with rustling and starchy boarders.,m
18191,"He found himself, instead, in a primeval pine forest in which were sheltered many low, austere buildings of logs, above whose great chimneys stood vertical columns of pale smoke.",m
18192,"It was not yet dusk, but the air among the long shadows had an icy quality and was heavily charged with the odor of balsam.",m
18193,"It was difficult to believe the season summer, and Mr. Jonstone was reminded of December evenings in the Carolinas.",m
18194,"""This is the office,"" said Mr. Langham, and he ushered them into the presence of a bright birch fire and Maud Darling.",m
18195,Each of the Carolinians drew a quick breath and bowed as if before royalty.,m
18196,Mr. Langham presented them to Miss Darling.,m
18197,She begged them to write their names in the guest book and to warm themselves at the fire.,m
18198,"""And then,"" said Sam Langham, ""I'll shake them up a cocktail and show them their house.""",m
18199,"""Are we to have a whole house to ourselves?"" asked Colonel Meredith.",m
18200,He had not yet taken his eyes from Maud Darling's face.,m
18201,"""It's only two rooms: bath, parlor, and piazza,"" she explained.",m
18202,"""That last?"" asked Mr. Jonstone.",m
18203,"""It's the same thing as a 'poach,'"" explained Mr. Langham with a sly twinkle in his eyes.",m
18204,"""It's to sit on and enjoy the view from,"" added Maud.",m
18205,"""But I don't want to admire the view,"" complained Colonel Meredith.",m
18206,"""I want to lounge about the office.",m
18207,"It's the prerogative of every American citizen to lounge about the office of his hotel.""",m
18208,Colonel Meredith had yet to take his eyes from Maud Darling's face.,m
18209,And it was with protest written all over it that he at length followed his cousin and Mr. Langham into the open air.,m
18210,"The three were presently sampling a cocktail of the latter's shaking in the latter's snug little house, and speech was loosened in their mouths.",m
18211,"""Darling, _pere_,"" explained Sam Langham, ""went broke.",m
18212,"He used to run this place as it is run now, with this difference: that in the old days he put up the money, while now it is the guests who pay.",m
18213,"Two years ago the Miss Darling you just met was one of the greatest heiresses in America; now she keeps books and makes out bills.""",m
18214,"""And are there truly five others equally lovely?"" asked Colonel Meredith.",m
18215,"""Some people think that the oldest of the six is also the loveliest,"" said Sam Langham, loyal to the choice of his own heart.",m
18216,"""But they are all very lovely.""",m
18217,"To the Carolinians, warmed by Langham's cocktail, it seemed pitiful that six beautiful girls who had had so much should now have so little.",m
18218,And with a little encouragement they would have been moved to the expression of exaggerated sentiments.,m
18219,"It was Maud, however, and not the others, who had aroused these feelings in their breasts.",m
18220,The desire to benefit her by some secret action--and then to be found out--was very strong in them both.,m
18221,Langham left them after a time and they began to dress for dinner.,m
18222,"Usually they had a great deal to say to each other; often they disputed and were gorgeously insolent to each other about the most trifling things, but on the present occasion their one desire was to dress as rapidly as possible and to visit the office upon some pretext or other.",m
18223,"When Colonel Meredith from the engulfment of a starched shirt announced that he had several letters to write and wondered where one could buy postage-stamps, it afforded Bob Jonstone malicious satisfaction to inform him that the ""little drawer in their writing-table contained not only plenty of twos but fives and a strip of special deliveries.""",m
18224,"""All I have to think about,"" said he, ""is my laundry.",m
18225,"I suppose they can tell me at the office.""",m
18226,"""_They?_"" exclaimed Colonel Meredith.",m
18227,"As he spoke the collar button sprang like a slippery cherry-stone from between his thumb and forefinger, fell in the exact middle of the room in a perfectly bare place, and disappeared.",m
18228,Up to this moment the cousins had remained on even terms in the race to be dressed first.,m
18229,"But now Mr. Jonstone gained and, before the collar button was found, had given a parting ""slick"" to his hair and gone out.",m
18230,"It was now dark, and the woodland streets of The Camp were lighted by lanterns.",m
18231,Windows were bright-yellow rectangles.,m
18232,A wind had risen and the lake could be heard slapping against the rocky shore.,m
18233,Maud Darling had left the office long enough to change from tailor-made tweeds to the simplest white muslin.,m
18234,She was adding up a column in a fat book.,m
18235,"She looked golden in the firelight and the lamplight, and resembled some heavenly being but for the fact that, for the moment, she was puzzled to discover the sum of seven and five and was biting the end of her pencil.",m
18236,"The divine muse of Inspiration lives in the ""other"" ends of pens and pencils.",m
18237,"The world owes many of its masterpieces of literature and invention to reflective nibbling at these instruments, and if I were a teacher I should think twice before I told my pupils to take their pencils out of their mouths.",m
18238,Mr. Jonstone knocked on the open door of the office.,m
18239,"""This is the office,"" said Miss Maud Darling;",m
18240,"""you don't have to knock.",m
18241,"Is anything not right?""",m
18242,"""Everything is absolutely perfect,"" bowed Mr. Jonstone.",m
18243,"""But you are busy.",m
18244,I could come again.,m
18245,"I only wanted to ask about sending some things to a laundry.""",m
18246,"""You're not supposed to think about that,"" said Maud.",m
18247,"""There is a clothes-bag in the big closet in your bedroom and my sister Eve does the rest.""",m
18248,"""Oh, but I couldn't allow----""  ""Not with her own hands, of course; she merely oversees the laundry and keeps it up to the mark.",m
18249,"But if you like your things to be done in any special way you must see her and explain.""",m
18250,"""In my home,"" said Jonstone, ""my old mammy does all the washing and most everything else, and I wouldn't dare to find fault.",m
18251,She would follow me up-stairs and down scolding all the time if I did.,m
18252,"You see, though she isn't a slave any more, she's never had any wages, and so she takes it out in privileges and prerogatives.""",m
18253,"""No wages ever since the Civil War!"" exclaimed Maud.",m
18254,"""We had to have servants,"" he explained, ""and until the other day there was never any money to pay them with.",m
18255,"We had nothing but the plantation and the family silver.""",m
18256,"""And of course you couldn't part with that.",m
18257,In the North when we get hard up we sell anything we've got.,m
18258,"But in the South you don't, and I've always admired that trait in you beyond measure.""",m
18259,"""In that case,"" said Mr. Jonstone, turning a little pale, ""it is my duty to tell you that the other day I parted with my silver in exchange for a large sum of money.",m
18260,"I made up my mind that I had only one life to live and that I was sick of being poor.""",m
18261,Maud smiled.,m
18262,"""If you want to keep your ill-gotten gains,"" she said, ""you ought never to have come to this place.",m
18263,Wasn't there some kind friend to tell you that our prices are absolutely prohibitive?,m
18264,We haven't gone into business for fun but with the intention of making money hand over fist.,m
18265,"It's only fair to warn you.""",m
18266,"She imagined that, at the outside, he might have received a couple of thousand dollars for his family silver, and it seemed wicked that he should be allowed to part with this little capital for food, lodging, and a little trout-fishing.",m
18267,"""My silver,"" he said, ""turned out to be worth a lot of money, and I have put it all in trust for myself, so that my wife and children shall never want.""",m
18268,A flicker of disappointment appeared in Maud Darling's eyes.,m
18269,"""But I didn't know you were married,"" she said lamely.",m
18270,"""Oh, I'm not--yet!"" he exclaimed joyfully.",m
18271,"""But I mean to be.""",m
18272,"""Engaged?"" she asked.",m
18273,"""Hope to be--mean to be,"" he confessed.",m
18274,And at this moment Colonel Melville Meredith came in out of the night.,m
18275,"Having bowed very low to Miss Darling, he turned to his cousin.",m
18276,"""Did Langham find you?"" he asked.",m
18277,"""No.""",m
18278,"""Well, he's a-waiting at our house.",m
18279,"I said I thought you'd be right back.""",m
18280,"""Then we--"" began Jonstone.",m
18281,"""Not we--_you_,"" said his cousin, malice in his eyes.",m
18282,"""I want to ask Miss Darling some questions about telegrams and special messages by telephone.""",m
18283,Bob Jonstone withdrew himself with the utmost reluctance.,m
18284,"""We have a telephone that connects us with the telegraph office at Carrytown,"" Maud began, but Colonel Meredith interrupted almost rudely.",m
18285,"""We engaged our rooms for ten days only,"" he said, ""but I want to keep them for the rest of the summer.",m
18286,"Please don't tell me that they are promised to some one else.""",m
18287,"""But they are,"" said she;",m
18288,"""I'm very sorry.""",m
18289,"""Can't you possibly keep us?""",m
18290,She shook her fine head less in negation than reflection.,m
18291,"""I don't see how,"" she said finally, ""unless some one gives out at the last minute.",m
18292,"There are just so many rooms and just so many applicants.""",m
18293,"""How long,"" he asked, ""would it take to build a little house for my cousin and me?""",m
18294,"""If we got all the carpenters from Carrytown,"" said Maud, ""it could be done very quickly.",m
18295,"But----""  ""Now you are going to make some other objection!""",m
18296,"""I was only going to say that if you wanted to go camping for a few weeks, we could supply you with everything needful.",m

18300,"""Exactly.",m
18301,"There is no reason why you shouldn't pitch your tent in the main street of this camp and live in it.""",m
18302,"""That's just what we'll do,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""and to-morrow we'll pick out the site for the tent--if you'll help us.""",m
18303,XXII   Early the next morning Colonel Meredith and his cousin Bob Jonstone presented themselves at the office dressed for walking.,m
18304,Butter would not have melted in their mouths.,m
18305,"""Can you come now and help us pick out a site for the tent?"" asked the youthful colonel.",m
18306,"Maud was rather busy that morning, but she closed her ledger, selected a walking-stick, and smiled her willingness to aid them.",m
18307,"""It will seem more like real camping-out,"" said Mr. Jonstone, ""if we don't pitch our tent right in the midst of things.",m
18308,"Suppose we take a boat and row along the shores of the lake, keeping our eyes peeled.""",m
18309,Maud was not averse to going for a row with two handsome and agreeable young men.,m
18310,They selected a guide boat and insisted on helping her in and cautioning her about sitting in the middle.,m
18311,"Maud had almost literally been brought up in a guide boat, but she only smiled discreetly.",m
18312,The cousins matched for places.,m
18313,"As Maud sat in the stern with a paddle for steering, Colonel Meredith, who won the toss, elected to row stroke.",m
18314,Bob Jonstone climbed with gingerness and melancholy into the bow.,m
18315,"Not only was he a long way from that beautiful girl, but Meredith's head and shoulders almost completely blanketed his view of her.",m
18316,"""We ought to row English style,"" he said.",m
18317,"""What is English style, and why ought we to row that way?""",m
18318,"""In the American shells,"" explained Jonstone, ""the men sit in the middle.",m
18319,"In the English shells each man sits as far from his rowlock as possible.""",m
18320,"""Why?"" asked Meredith, who understood his cousin's predicament perfectly.",m
18321,"""So's to get more leverage,"" explained Jonstone darkly.",m
18322,"""It's for Miss Darling to say,"" said Meredith.",m
18323,"""Which style do you prefer, Miss Darling, English or American?""",m
18324,"""I think the American will be more comfortable for you both and safer for us all,"" said she.",m
18325,"""There!"" exclaimed the man of war, ""what did I tell you?""",m
18326,"""But--"" continued Maud.",m
18327,"""I could have told you there would be a 'but,'"" interrupted Jonstone triumphantly.",m
18328,"""But,"" repeated Maud, ""I'm coxswain, and I want to see what every man in my boat is doing.""",m
18329,So they rowed English style.,m
18330,"""It's like a dinner-party,"" explained Maud to Colonel Meredith, who appeared slightly discomforted.",m
18331,"""Don't you know how annoying it is when there's a tall centrepiece and you can't see who's across the table from you?""",m
18332,"""Even if you don't want to look at him when you have found out who he is,"" agreed Meredith.",m
18333,"""Exactly.""",m
18334,They came to a bold headland of granite crowned with a half-dozen old pines that leaned waterward.,m
18335,"""That's rather a wonderful site, I think,"" said Maud.",m
18336,"""Where?"" said the gentlemen, turning to look over their shoulders.",m
18337,"Then, ""It looks well enough from the water,"" said Jonstone, ""but we ought not to choose wildly.""",m
18338,"""Let us land,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""and explore.""",m
18339,They landed and began at once to find reasons for pitching the tent on the promontory and reasons for not pitching it.,m
18340,"""The site is open and airy,"" said Jonstone.",m
18341,"""It is,"" said Colonel Meredith.",m
18342,"""But, in case of a southwest gale, our tent would be blown inside out.""",m
18343,"A moment later, ""How about drinking-water?"" asked the experienced military man.",m
18344,"""I regret to say that I have just stepped into a likely spring,"" said Jonstone.",m
18345,"""We must sit down and wait till it clears.""",m
18346,When the spring once more bubbled clean and undefiled Mr. Jonstone scooped up two palmfuls of water and drank.,m
18347,"""Delicious!"" he cried.",m
18348,Colonel Meredith then sampled the spring and shook his head darkly.,m
18349,"""This spring has a main attribute of drinking-water,"" he said;",m
18350,"""it is wet.",m
18351,"Otherwise----""  ""What's the matter with my spring?"" demanded his cousin.",m
18352,"""Silica, my dear fellow--silica.",m
18353,"And you know very well that silica to a man of your inherited tendencies spells gout.""",m
18354,Jonstone nodded gravely.,m
18355,"""I'm afraid that settles it.""",m
18356,And he turned to Maud Darling.,m
18357,"""I can keep clear of gout,"" he explained, ""only just as long as I keep my system free from silica.""",m
18358,"""Do you usually manage to?"" asked Maud, very much puzzled.",m
18359,"""So far,"" he said, ""I have _always_ managed to.""",m
18360,"""Then you have never suffered from gout?""",m
18361,"""Never.",m
18362,"But now, having drunk at this spring, I have reason to fear the worst.",m
18363,"It will take at least a week to get that one drink out of my system.""",m
18364,"And so they passed from the promontory with the pine-trees to a little cove with a sandy beach, from this to a wooded island not much bigger than a tennis-court.",m
18365,"In every suggested site Jonstone found multitudinous charms and advantages, while Colonel Meredith, from the depths of his military experience, produced objections of the first water.",m
18366,For to be as long as possible in the company of that beautiful girl was the end which both sought.,m
18367,"Maud had gone upon the expedition in good faith, but when its true object dawned upon her she was not in the least displeased.",m
18368,The very obvious worship which the Carolinians had for her beauty was not so personal as to make her uncomfortable.,m
18369,It was rather the worship of two artists for art itself than for a particular masterpiece.,m
18370,Of the six beautiful Darlings Maud had had the least experience of young men.,m
18371,"She was given to fits of shyness which passed with some as reserve, with others as a kind of common-sense and matter-of-fact way of looking at life.",m
18372,"The triplets, young as they were, surpassed the other three in conquests and experience.",m
18373,And this was not because they were more lovely and more charming but because they had been a little spoiled by their father and brought into the limelight before their time.,m
18374,"Furthermore, with the exception of Phyllis, perhaps, they were maidens of action to whom there was no recourse in books or reflection.",m
18375,Such accomplishments as drawing and music had not been forced upon them.,m
18376,They could not have made a living teaching school.,m
18377,"But Lee and Gay certainly could have taught the young idea how to shoot, how to throw a fly, and how to come in out of the wet when no house was handy.",m
18378,"As for Phyllis, she would have been as like them as one pea is like two others but for the fact that at the age of two she had succeeded in letting off a 45-90 rifle which some fool had left about loaded and had thereby frightened her early sporting promises to death.",m
18379,"But it was only of weapons, squirming fish, boats, and thunder storms that she was shy.",m
18380,"Young gentlemen had no terrors for her, and she preferred the stupidest of these to the cleverest of books.",m
18381,"Mary, Maud, and Eve had wasted a great part of their young lives upon education.",m
18382,"They could play the piano pretty well (you couldn't tell which was playing); they sang charmingly; they knew French and German; they could spell English, and even speak it correctly, a power which they had sometimes found occasion to exercise when in the company of foreign diplomatists.",m
18383,The change in their case from girlhood to young womanhood had been sudden and prearranged: in each case a tremendous ball upon a given date.,m
18384,"The triplets had never ""come out.""",m
18385,"If Lee or Gay had been the victim of the present conspiracy, the gentlemen from Carolina would have found their hands full and overflowing.",m
18386,They would have been teased and misconstrued within an inch of their lives; but Maud Darling was genuinely moved by the candor and chivalry of their combined attentions.,m
18387,"There was a genuine joyousness in her heart, and she did not care whether they got her home in time for lunch or not.",m
18388,And it was only a strong sense of duty which caused her to point out the high position attained by the sun in the heavens.,m
18389,With reluctance the trio gave up the hopeless search for a camp site and started for home upon a long diagonal across the lake.,m
18390,"It was just then, as if a signal had been given, that the whole surface of the lake became ruffled as when a piece of blue velvet is rubbed the wrong way, and a strong wind began to blow in Maud's face and upon the backs of the rowers.",m
18391,Several hours of steady rowing had had its effect upon unaccustomed hands.,m
18392,"It was now necessary to pull strongly, and blisters grew swiftly from small beginnings and burst in the palms of the Carolinians.",m
18393,"Maud came to their rescue with her steering paddle, but the wind, bent upon having sport with them, sounded a higher note, and the guide boat no longer seemed quick to the least propulsion and light on the water, but as if blunt forward, high to the winds, and half full of stones.",m
18394,"She did not run between strokes but came to dead stops, and sometimes, during strong gusts, actually appeared to lose ground.",m
18395,The surface of the lake didn't as yet testify truly to the full strength of the wind.,m
18396,"But soon the little waves grew taller, the intervals between them wider, and their crests began to be blown from them in white spray.",m
18397,"The heavens darkened more and more, and to the northeast the sky-line was gradually blotted out as if by soft gray smoke.",m
18398,"""We're going to have rain,"" said Maud, ""and we're going to have fog.",m
18399,"So we'd better hurry a little.""",m
18400,"""Hurry?"" thought the Carolinians sadly.",m
18401,"And they redoubled their efforts, with the result that they began to catch crabs.",m
18402,"""Some one ought to see us and send a launch,"" said Maud.",m
18403,"At that moment, as the wind flattens a field of wheat to the ground, the waves bent and lay down before a veritable blast of black rain.",m
18404,It would have taken more than human strength to hold the guide boat to her course.,m
18405,Maud paddled desperately for a quarter of a minute and gave up.,m
18406,"The boat swung sharply on her keel, rocked dangerously, and, once more light and sentient, a creature of life, made off bounding before the gale.",m
18407,"""We are very sorry,"" said the Carolinians, ""but the skin is all off our hands, and at the best we are indifferent boatmen.""",m
18408,"""The point is this,"" said Maud: ""Can you swim?""",m
18409,"""I can,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""but I am extremely sorry to confess that my cousin's aquatic education has been neglected.",m
18410,"Where he lives every pool contains crocodiles, leeches, snapping-turtles, and water-moccasins, and the incentive to bathing for pleasure is slight.""",m
18411,"""Don't worry about me,"" said Mr. Jonstone.",m
18412,"""I can cling to the boat until the millennium.""",m
18413,"""We shan't upset--probably,"" said Maud.",m
18414,"""It will be better if you two sit in the bottom of the boat.",m
18415,I'll try to steer and hold her steady.,m
18416,This isn't the first time I've been blown off shore and then on shore.,m
18417,"I suppose I ought to apologize for the weather, but it really isn't my fault.",m
18418,"Who would have thought this morning that we were in for a storm?""",m
18419,"""If only you don't mind,"" said Colonel Meredith.",m
18420,"""It's all _our_ fault.",m
18421,You probably didn't want to come.,m
18422,"You just came to be friendly and kind, and now you are hungry and wet to the skin----""  ""But,"" interrupted Bob Jonstone, ""if only you will forget all that and think what pleasure we are having.""",m
18423,"""I can't hear what you say,"" called Maud.",m
18424,"""I beg your pardon,"" shouted Mr. Jonstone.",m
18425,"""I didn't quite catch that.",m
18426,"What did Miss Darling say, Mel?""",m
18427,"""She said she wanted to talk to me and for you to shut up.""",m
18428,"Mr. Jonstone made a playful but powerful swing at his cousin, and the guide boat, as if suddenly tired of her passengers, calmly upset and spilled them out.",m
18429,A moment later the true gallantry of Mr. Bob Jonstone showed forth in glorious colors.,m
18430,"Having risen to the surface and made good his hold upon the overturned boat, he proposed very humbly, as amends for causing the accident, to let go and drown.",m
18431,"""If you do,"" said Maud, excitement overcoming her sense of the ridiculous, ""I'll never speak to you again.""",m
18432,Colonel Meredith opened his mouth to laugh and closed it a little hastily on about a pint of water.,m
18433,"XXIII   The water was so rough, the weather so thick, and their point of view so very low down in the world that Maud and the Carolinians could neither see the shore from which they had departed nor that toward which they were slowly drifting.",m
18434,"The surface water was warm, however, owing to a week of sunshine, and it was not necessary to drop one's legs into the icy stratum beneath.",m
18435,"It is curious that what the three complained of the most was the incessant, leaden rain.",m
18436,Their faces were colder than their bodies.,m
18437,They admitted that they had never been so wet in all their lives.,m
18438,"Maud and Colonel Meredith, not content with the slow drifting, kicked vigorously; but Bob Jonstone had all he could do to cling to the guide boat and keep his head above water.",m
18439,His legs had a way of suddenly rising toward the surface and wrapping themselves half around the submerged boat.,m
18440,An effort was made to right the boat and bale her out.,m
18441,But Maud's water-soaked skirt and a sudden case of rattles on the part of Jonstone prevented the success of the manoeuvre.,m
18442,Half an hour passed.,m
18443,"""Personally,"" said Jonstone, ""I've had about enough of this.""",m
18444,His clinging hands looked white and thin; the knuckles were beginning to turn blue.,m
18445,"He had a drawn expression about the mouth, but his eyes were bright and resolute.",m
18446,"""I've always understood,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""that girls suffer less than men from total submersion in cold water.",m
18447,"I sincerely hope, Miss Darling, that this is so.""",m
18448,"""Oh, I'm not suffering,"" said she;",m
18449,"""not yet.",m
18450,My father used to let us go in sometimes when there was a skin of ice along shore.,m
18451,"So please don't worry about me.""",m
18452,Mr. Jonstone's teeth began to chatter very steadily and loudly.,m
18453,"And just then Maud raised herself a little, craned her neck, and had a glimpse of the shore--a long, half-submerged point, almost but not quite obliterated by the fog and the splashing rain.",m
18454,"""Land ho!"" said she joyfully.",m
18455,"""All's well.",m
18456,"There's a big shallow off here; we'll be able to wade in a minute.""",m
18457,"And, indeed, in less than a minute Bob Jonstone's feet found the hard sand bottom.",m
18458,And in a very short time three shipwrecked mariners had waded ashore and dragged the guide boat into a clump of bushes.,m
18459,"""And now what?"" asked Colonel Meredith.",m
18460,"""And now,"" said Maud, ""the luck has changed.",m
18461,Half a mile from here is a cave where we used to have picnics.,m
18462,"There's an axe there, matches, and probably a tin of cigarettes, and possibly things to eat.",m
18463,"It's all up-hill from here, and if you two follow me and keep up, you'll be warm before we get there.""",m
18464,"Her wet clothes clung to her, and she went before them like some swift woodland goddess.",m
18465,"Their spirits rose, and with them their voices, so that the deer and other animals of the neighboring woods were disturbed and annoyed in the shelters which they had chosen from the rain.",m
18466,"Sometimes Maud ran; sometimes she merely moved swiftly; but now and then while the way was still among the dense waterside alders, she broke her way through with fine strength, reckless of scratches.",m
18467,The following Carolinians began to worship the ground she trod and to stumble heavily upon it.,m
18468,They were not used to walking.,m
18469,It had always been their custom to go from place to place upon horses.,m
18470,They panted aloud.,m
18471,"They began to suspect themselves of heart trouble, and they had one heavy fall apiece.",m
18472,Suddenly Maud came to a dead stop.,m
18473,"""I smell smoke,"" she said.",m
18474,"""Some one is here before us.",m
18475,"That's good luck, too.""",m
18476,She felt her way along the face of a great bowlder and was seen to enter the narrow mouth of a cave.,m
18477,"""Who's here?"" she called cheerfully.",m
18478,The passageway into the cave twisted like the letter S so that you came suddenly upon the main cavity.,m
18479,"This--a space as large as a ball-room--had a smooth floor of sand, broken by one or two ridges of granite.",m
18480,"At the farther end burned a bright fire, most of whose smoke after slow, aimless drifting was strongly sucked upward through a hole in the roof.",m
18481,"Closely gathered about this fire were four men, who looked like rather dissolute specimens of the Adirondack guide, and a young woman with an old face.",m
18482,"Maud's quick eyes noted two rusty Winchester rifles, a leather mail-bag, and the depressing fact that the men had not shaved for many days.",m
18483,It is always awkward to enter your own private cave and find it occupied by strangers.,m
18484,"""You mustn't mind,"" said Maud, smiling upon them, ""if we share the fire.",m
18485,"It's really our cave and our fire-wood.""",m
18486,"""Sorry, miss,"" said one of the men gruffly, ""but when it comes on to rain like this a man makes bold of any shelter that offers.""",m
18487,"""Of course,"" said Maud.",m
18488,"""I'm glad you did.",m
18489,"We'll just dry ourselves and go.""",m
18490,"She seated herself with a Carolinian on either side, and their clothes began to send up clouds of steam.",m
18491,"The young woman with the old face, having devoured Maud with hungry, sad eyes, spoke in a shy, colorless voice.",m
18492,"""It would be better, miss, if you was to let the boys go outside.",m
18493,"I could lend you my blanket while your clothes dried.""",m
18494,"""That's very good of you,"" said Maud, ""but I'm very warm and comfortable and drying out nicely.""",m
18495,"One of the men rose, grinned awkwardly, and said:  ""I'll just have a look at the weather.""",m
18496,With affected carelessness he caught up one of the Winchesters and passed from sight toward the entrance of the cave.,m
18497,This manoeuvre seemed to have a cheering effect upon the other three.,m
18498,"""What do you find to shoot at this time of year?"" asked Maud, and she smiled with great innocence.",m
18499,"""The game-laws,"" said the man who had spoken first, ""weren't written for poor men.""",m
18500,"""Don't tell me,"" exclaimed Maud, ""that you've got a couple of partridges or even venison just waiting to be cooked and eaten!""",m
18501,"""No such luck,"" said the man.",m
18502,Neither of the Carolinians had spoken.,m
18503,They steamed pleasantly and appeared to be looking for pictures in the hot embers.,m
18504,Their eyes seemed to have sunk deeper into their skulls.,m
18505,Men who were familiar with them would have known that they were very angry about something and as dangerous as a couple of rattlesnakes.,m
18506,After a long while they exchanged a few words in low voices and a strange tongue.,m
18507,It was the dialect of the Sea Island negroes--the purest African grafted on English so pure that nobody speaks it nowadays.,m
18508,"""What say?"" asked one of the strangers roughly.",m
18509,Colonel Meredith turned his eyes slowly upon the speaker.,m
18510,"""I remarked to my cousin,"" said he icily, ""that in our part of the world even the lowest convict knows enough to rise to his feet when a lady enters the room and to apologize for being alive.""",m
18511,"""In the North Woods,"" said the man sulkily, ""no one stands on ceremony.",m
18512,"If you don't like our manners, Mr. Baltimore Oriole, you can lump 'em, see?""",m
18513,"""I see,"" said Colonel Meredith quietly, ""that that leather mail-bag over there belongs to the United States Government.",m
18514,"And I have a strong suspicion, my man, that you and your allies were concerned in the late hold-up perpetrated on the Montreal express.",m
18515,"And I shall certainly make it my business to report you as suspicious characters to the proper authorities.""",m
18516,"""That'll be too easy,"" said the man.",m
18517,"""And suppose we was what you think, what would we be doing in the meantime?",m
18518,"I ask you _what_?""",m
18519,Mr. Jonstone interrupted in a soft voice.,m
18520,"""Oh, quit blustering and threatening,"" he said.",m
18521,"""Say,"" said a man who had not yet spoken, ""do you two sprigs of jasmine ever patronize the 'movies'?",m
18522,"And, if so, did you ever look your fill on a film called 'Held for Ransom'?",m
18523,"You folks has a look of being kind o' well to do, and it looks to me as if you'd have to pay for it.""",m
18524,"""Why quarrel with them?"" said Maud, with gravity and displeasure in her voice, but no fear.",m
18525,"""Things are bad enough as they are.",m
18526,I saw that the minute we came in.,m
18527,"Just one minute too late, it seems.""",m
18528,"""That's horse-sense,"" admitted one of the men.",m
18529,"""And when this rain holds up, one of us will take a message to your folks saying as how you are stopping at an expensive hotel and haven't got money enough to pay your bill.""",m
18530,"""And that,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""will only leave three of you to guard us.",m
18531,"Once,"" he turned to Maud, ""I spent six hours in a Turkish prison.""",m
18532,"""What happened?"" she asked.",m
18533,"""I didn't like it,"" he said, ""and left.""",m
18534,"""This ain't Turkey, young feller, and we ain't Turks.",m
18535,"If you don't like the cave you can lump it, but you can't leave.""",m
18536,"""We don't intend to leave till it stops raining,"" put in Mr. Jonstone sweetly.",m
18537,"""Miss Darling,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""you don't feel chilled, do you?",m
18538,You mustn't take this adventure seriously.,m
18539,"These people are desperate characters, but they haven't the mental force to be dangerous.",m
18540,"It will be the greatest pleasure in the world both to my cousin and myself to see that no harm befalls you.""",m
18541,He turned once more to the unshaven men about the fire.,m
18542,"""Have you got anything worth while in that mail-bag?"" he asked.",m
18543,"""I read that the safe in the Montreal express only contained a few hundred dollars.",m
18544,"Hardly worth risking prison for--was it?""",m
18545,"""We'll have enough to risk prison for before we get through with you.""",m
18546,"""You might if you managed well, because I am a rich man.",m
18547,"But you are sure to bungle.""",m
18548,"He turned to the woman and asked with great kindness:  ""Is it their first crime?""",m
18549,"""Yes, sir,"" she said.",m
18550,"""Mr.----""  ""Shut up!"" growled one of her companions.",m
18551,"""A gentleman from New York turned us out of the woods so's he could have them all to himself and after we'd spent all our money on lawyers.",m
18552,So my husband and the boys allowed they had about enough of the law.,m
18553,"And so they held up the express, but it was more because they were mad clear through than because they are bad, and now it's too late, and--and----""  Here she began to cry.",m
18554,"""It's never too late to mend,"" said Maud.",m
18555,"""Have you spent any of the money they took?"" asked Colonel Meredith.",m
18556,"""No, sir; we haven't had a chance.",m
18557,"We've got every dime of it.""",m
18558,"""Did you own the land you were driven off?""",m
18559,"""No, sir, but we'd always lived on it, and it did seem as if we ought to be left in peace----""  ""To shoot out of season, to burn other people's wood, trap their fish, and show your teeth at them when they came to take what belonged to them?",m
18560,I congratulate you.,m
18561,You are American to the backbone.,m
18562,"And now you propose to take my money away from me.""",m
18563,"Colonel Meredith turned to his cousin, after excusing himself to Maud, and they conversed for some time in their strange Sea Island dialect.",m
18564,"""Can that gibberish,"" said one of the train robbers suddenly.",m
18565,"""I'm sick of it.""",m
18566,"""We shan't trouble you with it again, as we've already decided what to do.""",m
18567,The robber laughed mockingly.,m
18568,"""In view of your extreme youth,"" said Colonel Meredith sweetly, ""in view of the fact that you are also young in crime and that one member of your party is a woman, we have decided to help you along the road to reform.",m
18569,"In my State there is considerable lawlessness; from this has evolved the useful custom of going heeled.""",m
18570,"He spoke, and a blue automatic flashed cruelly in his white hand.",m
18571,His action was as sudden and unexpected as the striking of a rattlesnake.,m
18572,"""All hands up,"" he commanded.",m
18573,There was a long silence.,m
18574,"""You've got us,"" said the youngest of the robbers sheepishly.",m
18575,"""How about the man on guard with a Winchester?""",m
18576,"""My cousin Mr. Jonstone will bring him in to join the conference.",m
18577,"And, meanwhile, I shall have to ask the ladies to look the other way while my cousin changes clothes with one of you gentlemen.""",m
18578,"Of the three villains, Jonstone selected the youngest and the tidiest, and with mutual reluctance, suspicion, and startled glances toward where the ladies sat with averted faces, they changed clothes.",m
18579,"A broad felt hat, several sizes too big for him, added the touch of completion to the Carolinian's transformation.",m
18580,"He took the spare Winchester and, without a word, walked quietly toward the mouth of the cave and was lost to sight.",m
18581,"Maud did not breathe freely until he had returned, unhurt, carrying both Winchesters and driving an exceedingly sheepish backwoodsman before him.",m
18582,He expressed the wish to resume his own clothes.,m
18583,"This done, he and his cousin broke into good-natured, boyish laughter.",m
18584,"The oldest and most sheepish of the backwoods-men kept repeating, ""Who would 'a' thought he'd have a pistol on him!"" and seemed to find a world of comfort in the thought.",m
18585,"""What are you going to do with them?""",m
18586,Maud asked almost in a whisper.,m
18587,"""I think I feel a little sorry for them.""",m
18588,"""Bob!"" exclaimed Colonel Meredith.",m
18589,"""What?""",m
18590,"""_She_ feels a little sorry for them.",m
18591,"Don't you?""",m
18592,"""Yes, _sir_!"" replied Mr. Jonstone fervently.",m
18593,Colonel Meredith addressed himself to the young woman with the old face.,m
18594,"""Do you believe in fairies?"" he asked.",m
18595,She only looked pathetic and confused.,m
18596,"""Miss Darling, here,"" he went on, ""is a fairy.",m
18597,"She left her wand at home, but if she wants to she can make people's wishes come true.",m
18598,Now suppose you and your friends talk things over and decide upon some sensible wishes to have granted.,m
18599,"Of course, it's no use wishing you hadn't robbed a train; but you could wish that the money would be returned, and that the police could be induced to stop looking for you, and that some one could come along and offer you an honest way of making a living.",m
18600,"So you talk it over a while and then tell us what you'd like.""",m
18601,"""Aren't you going to give us up?"" asked one of the men.",m
18602,"""Not if you've any sense at all.""",m
18603,"""Then I guess there's no use us talking things over.",m
18604,"And if the young lady is a fairy, we'd be obliged if she'd get busy along the lines you've just laid down.""",m
18605,All eyes were turned on Maud.,m
18606,And she looked appealingly from Colonel Meredith to Mr. Jonstone and back again.,m
18607,"""What ought I to say?",m
18608,What ought I to promise?,m
18609,_Can_ the money be returned?,m
18610,Can the police be called off?,m
18611,"And if I only had some work to give them, but over at The Camp----""  ""Every good fairy,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""has two helpers to whom all things are possible.""",m
18612,"""Truly?""",m
18613,"The Carolinians sprang to their feet, clicked their heels together into the first position of dancing, laid their right hands over their hearts, and bowed very low.",m
18614,"""Then,"" said Maud laughing, ""I should like the money to be returned.""",m
18615,"""I will attend to that,"" said Colonel Meredith.",m
18616,"""And the police to be called off.""",m
18617,Again the soldier assumed responsibility.,m
18618,"""But who,"" she asked, ""will find work for them?""",m
18619,"""I will,"" said Mr. Jonstone.",m
18620,"""They shall build the house for my cousin and me to live in.",m
18621,"You can build a house, can't you?",m
18622,"A log house?""",m
18623,"""But where will you build it?"" asked Maud.",m
18624,"""You found fault with all the best sites on the lake.""",m
18625,"""The very first site we visited suited us to perfection.""",m
18626,"""But you said the spring contained cyanide or something.""",m
18627,"""We were talking through our hats.""",m
18628,"""But why----""  The Carolinians gazed at her with a kind of beseeching ardor, until she understood that they had only found fault with one promising building site after another in order that they might pass the longest time possible in her company.",m
18629,And she returned their glance with one in which there was some feeling stronger than mere amusement.,m
18630,"XXIV   Concerning information, Mark Twain wrote that it appeared to stew out of him naturally, like the precious ottar of roses out of the otter.",m
18631,"With the narrator of this episodical history, however, things are very different.",m
18632,"And just how the good fairy, Maud Darling, was enabled to keep her promises to the outlaws seems to him of no great moment.",m
18633,"But the money _was_ returned to the express company; the police _were_ called off; and the four robbers, with the woman to cook for them, went to work at building a log house on the point of pines to be occupied in the near future by the Carolinians.",m
18634,They were not sorry to have been turned from a life of sin.,m
18635,"It is only when a life of sin is gilded, padded, and pleasant that people hate to turn from it.",m
18636,"When virtue entails being rained on, starved, and hunted, it isn't a very pleasant way of life, either.",m
18637,The face of the young female bandit lost its look of premature old age.,m
18638,"She went about her work singing, and the humming of the kettle was her accompaniment.",m
18639,The four men looked the other men of the camp in the face and showed how to lay trees by the heels in record time.,m
18640,To their well-swung and even better-sharpened axes even the stems of oaks were as wax candles.,m
18641,"It became quite ""the thing"" for guests at The Camp to go out to the point and admire the axe-work and all the processes of frontier house-building.",m
18642,"When people speak of ""love in a cottage,"" there rises nearly always, in my mind, the memory of a log house that a friend of mine and I came across by the headwaters of a great river in Canada.",m
18643,"It stood--the axe marks crisp, white, and blistered with pitch--upon the brink of a swirling brown pool full of grilse.",m
18644,"The logs of which it was built had been dragged from a distance, so that in the immediate neighborhood of the cabin was no desolation of dead tree-tops and dying stumps.",m
18645,"Everything was wonderfully neat, new, and in order.",m
18646,About the pool and the cabin the maples had turned yellow and vermilion.,m
18647,And above was the peaceful pale blue of an Indian-summer sky.,m
18648,"We opened the door, held by a simple latch, and found ourselves in the pleasantest of rooms, just twenty feet by fifteen.",m
18649,The walls and the floor had been much whitened and smoothed by the axe.,m
18650,The place smelt vaguely of pitch and strongly of balsam.,m
18651,"There was a fireplace--the fire all laid, a bunk to lie on, a chair to sit on, a table to write on, a broom to sweep with.",m
18652,"And neatly set upon clean shelves were various jams in glass, and meats, biscuits, and soups in tins.",m
18653,"There was also a writing (on birch bark) over the shelves, which read: ""Help yourself.""",m
18654,We took down the shutters from the windows and let in floods of autumn sun.,m
18655,"Then we lighted the fire, and ate crackers and jam.",m
18656,It hurt a little to learn at the mouth of our guide that the cabin belonged to a somewhat notorious and decidedly crotchety New York financier who controlled the salmon-fishing in those waters.,m
18657,I had pictured it as built for a pair of eminently sensible and supernaturally romantic honeymooners or for a poet.,m
18658,And I wanted to carry away that impression.,m
18659,For in such a place love or inspiration must have lasted just as long as the crackers and jam.,m
18660,And there is no more to be said of a palace.,m
18661,One day Mary Darling and Sam Langham visited the new cabin.,m
18662,"And Sam said: ""If one of the happy pair happened to know something of cooking, what a place for a honeymoon!""",m
18663,"Shortly afterward, Phyllis and Herring came that way, and Herring said: ""If I was in love, and knew how to use an axe, I'd build just such a house for the girl I love and make her live in it.",m
18664,"I believe I will, anyway.""",m
18665,"""Believe what?"" asked Phyllis demurely.",m
18666,"""Believe you will make her live in it?""",m
18667,"""Yes,"" he said darkly--""no matter who she is and no matter how afraid of the mice and spiders with which such places ultimately become infested.""",m
18668,"Lee and Renier visited the cabin, also.",m
18669,"They remarked only that it had a wonderfully smooth floor, and proceeded at once thereon, Lee whistling exquisitely and with much spirit, to dance a maxixe, which was greatly admired by the ex-outlaws.",m
18670,"Maud came often with the Carolinians, and as for Eve, she came once or twice all by herself.",m
18671,Jealousy is a horrid passion.,m
18672,It had never occurred to Eve Darling that she was or ever could be jealous of anybody.,m
18673,And she wasn't--exactly.,m
18674,But seeing her sisters always cavaliered by attractive men and slipping casually into thrilling and even dangerous adventures with them disturbed the depths of her equanimity.,m
18675,"It was delightful, of course, to be made much of by Arthur and to go upon excursions with him as of old.",m
18676,But something was wanting.,m
18677,"Arthur's idea of a pleasant day in the woods was to sit for hours by a pool and attempt to classify the croaks of frogs, or to lie upon his back in the sun and think about the girl in far-off China whom he loved so hopelessly.",m
18678,"Thanks to her excellent subordinate, and to her own administrative ability, Laundry House made fewer and fewer encroachments upon Eve's leisure.",m
18679,And often she found that time was hanging upon her hands with great heaviness.,m
18680,Memory reminded her that things had not always been thus; for there are men in this world who think that she was the most beautiful of all the Darlings.,m
18681,"It was curious that of all the men who had come to The Camp, Mr. Bob Jonstone had the most attraction for her.",m
18682,"They had not spoken half a dozen times, and it was quite obvious that his mind, if not his heart, was wholly occupied with Maud.",m
18683,"Wherever you saw Maud, you could be pretty sure that the Carolinians, hunting in a couple, were not far off.",m
18684,"Of the two, Colonel Meredith was the more brilliant, the more showy, and the better-looking.",m
18685,"Added to his good breeding and lazy, pleasant voice were certain Yankee qualities--a total lack of gullibility, a certain trace of mockery, even upon serious subjects.",m
18686,"Mr. Jonstone, on the other hand, was a perfect lamb of earnestness and sincerity.",m
18687,"If he heard of an injustice his eyes flamed, or if he listened to the recital of some pathetic happening they misted over.",m
18688,Once beyond the direct influence of his cousin there was neither mischief in him nor devilment.,m
18689,"It was for this reason, and in this knowledge, that he had put his newly acquired moneys in trust for himself.",m
18690,"In the little house by the lake where the cousins still slept, conversation seldom flagged before one or two o'clock in the morning.",m
18691,"Having said good-night to each other at about eleven, one or the other was pretty sure to let out some new discovery about the Darlings in general and Maud Darling in particular, and then all desire for sleep vanished and their real cousinly confidences began.",m
18692,"But these confidences had their limits, for neither confessed to being sentimentally interested in the young lady, whereas, within limits, they both were.",m
18693,And each enjoyed the satisfaction of believing (quite erroneously) that he deceived the other.,m
18694,I do not wish to convey the impression that they were actually in love with her.,m
18695,"When you are really in love, you are also in love before breakfast.",m
18696,That is the final test.,m
18697,"And when love begins to die, that is the time when its weakening pulse is first to be concerned.",m
18698,"What honest man has not been mad about some pretty girl (in a crescendo of madness) from tea time till sleep time and waked in the morning with no thought but for toast and coffee the soonest possible? and gone about the business of the morning and early afternoon almost heart-whole and fancy-free, and relapsed once more into madness with the lengthening of the shadows?",m
18699,A man who proposes marriage to a girl until he has been in love with her for twenty-four consecutive hours is a light fellow who ought to be kicked out of the house by her papa.,m
18700,"As for the girl, let her be sure that he is bread and meat to her, comfort and rest, demigod and man, wholly necessary and not to be duplicated in this world, before she even says that she will think about it.",m
18701,"In the early morning there would arise in the house of the Carolinians the sounds of whistling, of singing, laughter, scuffling, and running water.",m
18702,"So that a girl who really wanted either of them must, in listening, have despaired.",m
18703,"As for Maud Darling, she was disgusted with herself--theoretically.",m
18704,But practically she was having the time of her life.,m
18705,"In theory, she felt that no self-respecting girl ought to be unable to decide which of the two young men she liked the better.",m
18706,"In practice, she found a constant pondering of this delicate question to be delightful.",m
18707,It was very comfortable to know that the moment she was free to play there were two pleasant companions ready and waiting.,m
18708,Sentiment and gayety attended their goings and comings.,m
18709,"The Carolinians, fortified by each other's presence, were veritable Raleighs of extravagant devotion.",m
18710,"In engineering, for instance, so that Maud should not have to step in a damp place, there were displayed enough gallantry and efficiency to have saved her from an onslaught of tigers.",m
18711,"If the trio climbed a mountain, Maud gave herself up to the heart-warming delight of being helped when help was not in the least necessary.",m
18712,"In short, she behaved as any natural young woman would, and should.",m
18713,She flirted outrageously.,m
18714,But in the depths of her heart a genuine friendship for the Carolinians was conceived and grew in breadth and strength.,m
18715,What if they did out-gallant gallantry?,m
18716,"XXV   One Sunday, Eve, from her window--she was rather a lazy girl that Sunday--witnessed the following departures from the camp.",m
18717,"Sam Langham and Mary in a guide boat, with fishing-tackle and an immense hamper which looked like lunch.",m
18718,Herring and Phyllis could be seen hoisting the sails on the knockabout.,m
18719,Herring had never sailed a boat and was prepared to master that simple art at once.,m
18720,Lee and Renier were girt for the mountain.,m
18721,"Renier appeared to have a Flobert rifle in semihiding under his coat, and it was to be feared that if he saw a partridge, he would open fire on it, close season though it was.",m
18722,He and Lee would justify this illegal act by cooking the bird for their lunch.,m
18723,Gay commandeered the _Streak_ and departed at high speed toward Carrytown.,m
18724,"She had in one hand a sheet of blue-striped paper, folded.",m
18725,It resembled a cablegram.,m
18726,"And Eve thought that it must be of a very private nature, or else Gay would have telephoned it to the Western Union office, instead of carrying it by hand.",m
18727,The next to depart from the camp was Arthur.,m
18728,"He moved dreamily in a northwesterly direction, accompanied by Uncas, the chipmunk, and Wow, the dog.",m
18729,Other guests made departures.,m
18730,"All of which Eve, half dressed and looking lazily from her window, lazily noted, remarking that for her Sunday was a day of rest and that she thanked Heaven for it.",m
18731,And she did not feel any differently until Maud and the Carolinians walked out on the float and began to pack a guide boat for the day.,m
18732,"Then her lazy, complacent feelings departed, and were succeeded by a sudden, wide-awake surge of self-pity.",m
18733,She felt like Cinderella.,m
18734,"Nobody had asked her to go anywhere or do anything, and nobody had even thought of doing so.",m
18735,"When she was dead they would gather round her coffin and remember that they hadn't asked her to go anywhere or do anything, and they would be very sorry and ashamed and they would say what a nice girl she had been, and how she had always tried to give everybody a good time.",m
18736,"Between laughter and tears and mortification, Eve finished dressing, set her lovely jaw, and went out into the delicious, cool calm of the mountain morning.",m
18737,She could still hear the voices of many of the departing ones; and the rattling and creaking of the knockabout's blocks and rigging.,m
18738,"She heard Herring say to Phyllis: ""I think it would be better if I could make the boom go out on this side, but I can't.""",m
18739,"Phyllis's answer was a cool, contented laugh.",m
18740,"It was as if she said: ""Hang the boom!",m
18741,"_We're_ here!""",m
18742,"Have you ever had the feeling that you would like to board a swift boat, head for the open sea, and never come back?",m
18743,"Or that you could plunge into some boundless, trackless forest and keep straight on until you were lost, and died (beautifully and painlessly), and were covered with beautiful leaves by little birds?",m
18744,Eve enjoyed (and suffered from) a hint of this latter feeling.,m
18745,"She ate a light breakfast (it would be better not to begin starving till she was actually lost in the boundless, trackless forest), selected a light, spiked climbing-stick with a crooked handle, headed for one of the northeasterly mountains, and was soon deep in the shade of the pines and hemlocks.",m
18746,"After a few miles, the trail that she followed split and scattered in many directions, like the end of an unravelled rope.",m
18747,"She followed an old lumber road for a long way, turned into another that crossed it at an angle of forty-five degrees, took no account of the sun's position in the heavens or of the marked sides of trees.",m
18748,"If she came to a high place from which there was a view, she did not look at it.",m
18749,"She just kept going--this way and that, up and down.",m
18750,"In short, she made a conscious, anxious effort to lose herself.",m
18751,The easterly mountain toward which she had first headed kept bobbing up straight ahead.,m
18752,"And always there was the knowledge in the back of her head of the exact location of The Camp, and of all the other landmarks, familiar to her since early youth.",m
18753,"""Drag it!"" she said, at length, her eyes on the mountain.",m
18754,"""I'll climb the old thing, put melancholy aside, and call this a good, if unaccompanied, Sunday.""",m
18755,The morning coolness had departed.,m
18756,"It was one of those hot, breathless, mountain forenoons that kill the appetite and are usually followed, toward the late afternoon, by violent electrical disturbances.",m
18757,"Eve was not as fit as she had supposed, or as she thought.",m
18758,"As a matter of fact, she was setting too fast a pace, considering the weather and the angle of the mountain slope; and she was as wet as if she had played several hard sets of tennis with a partner who stood in one corner of the court and let her do all the running.",m
18759,"As she climbed, reproaching her wind for being so short, she remembered that the hollow tip of this particular northeastern mountain was filled with a deep pool of water.",m
18760,Nobody had ever called it a lake.,m
18761,The map called it a pond; but it wasn't even that--it was a pool.,m
18762,Springs fed it just fast enough to make up for the evaporation.,m
18763,It had no outlet.,m
18764,It was shaped like a fat letter O. At one end was a little beach of white sand.,m
18765,"Indeed, the bottom of the pool was all firm, smooth, and clean, and the whole charming little body of water was surrounded by thick groves of dwarf mountain trees and bushes.",m
18766,"Not content with being a perfect replica, in miniature, of a full-grown Adirondack lake, this pool had in its midst an island, a dozen feet in diameter, densely shrubbed and shaded by one diminutive Japanesque pine.",m
18767,"When Eve came to the pool, hot, tired, and rather bothered at the thought of the long walk back to camp, she had but the vaguest idea of just why the Lord had placed such a pool on top of a mountain, impelled her to climb that mountain, and made the day so piping hot.",m
18768,Eve stood a little on the sand beach.,m
18769,"She felt hotter and hotter, and the pool looked cooler and cooler.",m
18770,"Presently, a heavenly smile of solution brightened her flushed, warm face, and she withdrew into a shady clump of bushes.",m
18771,"From this there came first the exclamation ""Drag it!"" then a sound of some sort of a string being sharply broken in two, and then there came from the clump of bushes Eve herself, looking for all the world like a slice of the silver moon.",m
18772,"And as you may have seen the silver moon slip slowly into the sea, so Eve vanished slowly into the pool--all but her shapely little round head, with its crisp bright-brown hair and its lovely face, happy now, exhilarated, and eager as are the faces of adventurers.",m
18773,"And Eve thought if one didn't have to eat, if one didn't end by being cold, if one could make time stand still--she would choose to be always and forever a slice of the silver moon, lolling in a mountain pool.",m
18774,She had the kind of hair that wets to perfection.,m
18775,"But it was not the sort of permanent wave which lasts six months or so, costs twenty-five dollars, and is inculcated by hours of alternate baking and shampooing.",m
18776,Eve had always had a permanent wave.,m
18777,"She feared neither fog nor rain, nor water in any form of application.",m
18778,"And so it was that, now and then, as she lolled about the pool, she disappeared from one fortunate square yard of surface and reappeared in another.",m
18779,"Half an hour had passed, when suddenly the mountain stillness was broken by men's voices.",m
18780,Eve was at the opposite side of the pool from where she had left her clothes.,m
18781,Between her and the approaching voices was the little island.,m
18782,She landed hastily upon this and hid herself among the bushes.,m
18783,"Three gross, fat men and one long, lean man, with a face like leather and an Adam's apple that bobbed like a fisherman's float, came down to the beach, sweating terribly, and cast thereon knapsacks, picnic baskets, hatchets, fishing-tackle, and all the complicated paraphernalia of amateurs about to cook their own lunch in the woods.",m
18784,"All but one had loud, coarse, carrying voices, and they all appeared to belong to the ruling class.",m
18785,"They appeared, in short, to have neither education nor refinement nor charm nor anything to commend them as leaders or examples.",m
18786,Eve wondered how it was possible for them to find pleasure even in each other's company.,m
18787,"They quarrelled, wrangled, found fault, abused each other, or suddenly forgot their differences, gathering about the fattest of the fat men and listening, almost reverently, while he told a story.",m
18788,"When he had finished, they would throw their heads far back and scream with laughter.",m
18789,"He must have told wonderfully funny stories; but his voice was no more than a husky whisper, so that Eve could not make head or tail of them.",m
18790,After a while the whispering fat man produced from one of the baskets four little glasses and a fat dark bottle.,m
18791,And shortly after there was less wrangling and more laughter.,m
18792,"The thin man with the leathery face and the bobbing Adam's apple put a fishing-rod together, tied a couple of gaudy flies to his leader, and began to cast most unskilfully from the shores of the pool, moving along slowly from time to time.",m
18793,"The fat men, occasionally calling to ask if he had caught anything, busied themselves with preparations for lunch.",m
18794,One of them made tremendous chopping sounds in the wood and furnished from time to time incommensurate supplies of fire-wood.,m
18795,Smoke arose and a kettle was slung.,m
18796,"Meanwhile Eve, cowering among the bushes, for all the world like her famous ancestress when the angel came to the garden, did not quite know what to do.",m
18797,"She had only to lift her voice and explain, and the men would go away for a time.",m
18798,She felt sure of that.,m
18799,She had been brought up to believe in the exquisite chivalry of the plain American man.,m
18800,"But there was something about the four which repelled her, which stuck in her throat.",m
18801,She did not wish to be under any sort of obligation to any of them.,m
18802,"And so she kept mousy-quiet, and turned over in her mind an immense number of worthless stratagems and expedients.",m
18803,Have you ever tried to lie on the lawn under a tree and read for an hour or two--incased in all your buffer of clothes?,m
18804,Try it some time--without the buffers.,m
18805,Try it in the buff.,m
18806,And then imagine how comfortable Eve was on the island.,m
18807,"Imagine how soft it felt to her elbows, for instance.",m
18808,"And imagine to yourself, too, that it was not an uninhabited island--but one upon which an immense gray spider had made a home and raised a family.",m
18809,"From time to time the inept caster of flies returned to the camp-fire, always in answer to a boisterous summons from his friends.",m
18810,"And after each visit, his leathery face became redder and his casting more absurd.",m
18811,"Finally his flies caught in a tree, his rod broke, and he abandoned the gentle art of angling for that time and place.",m
18812,Meanwhile steam ran from the kettle and mingled with the smoke of the fire.,m
18813,The sound of voices was incessant.,m
18814,Ten minutes later the gentlemen were served.,m
18815,"Midway of the meal, some of which was burnt black and some of which was quite raw, there was produced a thermos bottle as big as the leg of a rubber boot.",m
18816,"And a moment later, icy-cold champagne was frothing and bubbling in tumblers.",m
18817,"In that high air, upon a thick foundation of raw whiskey, the brilliant wine of France had soon built a triumphant edifice, so that Eve, cold now, miserable, and frightened, felt that the time for an appeal to chivalry was long since past.",m
18818,"Far from their wives and constituents, the four politicians were obviously not going to stop short of complete drunkenness.",m
18819,"Indeed, it was an opportunity hardly to be missed.",m
18820,"For where else in the woods could nature be more exquisite, dignified, and inspiring?",m
18821,It got so that Eve could no longer bear to watch them or to listen to them.,m
18822,"Pink with shame, fury, hatred, and fear, she stuffed her fingers in her ears and hid her face.",m
18823,"Thus lying, there came to her after quite a long interval, dimly, a shout and a howl of laughter with an entirely new intonation.",m
18824,"She looked up then and saw the thin man, waist-deep in the bushes, just where she had left her clothes, making faces of beastly mystery at his companions, beckoning to them and urging them to come look.",m
18825,"They went to him, presently, staggering and evil.",m
18826,And then they scattered and began to hunt for her.,m
18827,"XXVI   ""Tired?"" queried Mr. Bob Jonstone, with some indignation.",m
18828,"""I'm not a bit tired.",m
18829,I haven't had enough exercise to keep me quiet.,m
18830,"And if it wasn't your turn to make the fire, your privilege, and your prerogative, I'd insist on chopping the wood myself.",m
18831,"No,"" he said, leaning back luxuriously, ""I find it very hard to keep still.",m
18832,This walking on the level is child's play.,m
18833,"What I need to keep me in good shape is mountains to climb.""",m
18834,"""Like those we have at home,"" said Colonel Meredith, and if he didn't actually wink at Maud, who was arranging some chops on a broiler, he made one eye smaller than the other.",m
18835,"""What's wrong with _this_ mountain?"" asked Maud.",m
18836,"""Why, we are only half-way up, and the real view is from the top!""",m
18837,"""Of course,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""if you want to see the view, don't let us stop you.",m
18838,We'll wait for you.,m
18839,"Won't we, Miss Maud?""",m
18840,"She nodded, her eyes shining with mischief.",m
18841,"""But,"" the colonel continued, ""Bob is a bluff.",m
18842,He's had all the climbing he can stand.,m
18843,"Nothing but a chest full of treasure or a maiden in distress would take him a step farther.""",m
18844,"""After lunch,"" said Mr. Jonstone, ""I shall.""",m
18845,"""Do it now!",m
18846,Lunch won't be ready for an hour.,m
18847,Any kind of a walker could make the top of the mountain and be back in that time.,m

18852,"Mr. Jonstone leaped to his feet in a business-like way, waved his hand to them, and started briskly off and up along the trail by which they had come, and which ended only at the very top of the mountain.",m
18853,It wasn't that he wanted any more exercise.,m
18854,He wanted to get away for a while to think things over.,m
18855,"He had learned on that day's excursion, or thought he had, that two is company and that three isn't.",m
18856,The pleasant interchangeableness of the trio's relations seemed suddenly to have undergone a subtle change.,m
18857,It was as if Maud and Colonel Meredith had suddenly found that they liked each other a little better than they liked him.,m
18858,"So it wasn't a man in search of exercise or eager to win a bet who was hastening toward the top of a mountain, but a child who had just discovered that dolls are stuffed with sawdust.",m
18859,"He suffered a little from jealousy, and a little from anger.",m
18860,"He could not have specified what they had done to him that morning, and it may have been his imagination alone that was to blame, but they had made him feel, or he had made himself feel, like a guest who is present, not because he is wanted but because for some reason or other he had to be asked.",m
18861,He walked himself completely out of breath and that did his mind good.,m
18862,"Resting before making a final spurt to the mountain-top, he heard men's voices shouting and hallooing in the forest.",m
18863,"The sounds carried him back to certain coon and rabbit hunts in his native state, and he wondered what these men could be hunting.",m
18864,"And having recovered his breath, he went on.",m
18865,"He came suddenly in view of a great round pool of water in the midst of which was a tiny island, thickly wooded.",m
18866,Just in front of him a fire burned low on a beach of white sand.,m
18867,"Upon the beach, his back to Jonstone, stood a tall, thin man who appeared to be gazing at the island.",m
18868,"Suddenly this man began to shout aloud:  ""She's on the island!",m
18869,"She's on the island!""",m
18870,"From the woods came the sound of crashings, scramblings, and oaths, and, one by one, three fat men, very sweaty and crimson in the face, came reeling out on the beach, and ranged themselves with the thin man, and looked drunkenly toward the island.",m
18871,"""She's hiding on the island, the cute thing,"" said the thin man.",m
18872,"""Did you see her?""",m
18873,"""I saw the bushes move.",m
18874,"That's where she is.""",m
18875,"""How deep's the water?""",m
18876,"""I'll tell you in about a minute,"" said the thin man.",m
18877,"He threw his coat from him, and, sitting down with a sudden lurch, began to unlace his boots.",m
18878,"""Maybe you don't know it,"" he said, ""but I'm some swimmer, I am.""",m
18879,There was a moment of silence and then there came from the island a voice that sent a thrill through Mr. Bob Jonstone from head to foot.,m
18880,The voice was like frightened music with a sob in it.,m
18881,"""Won't you please go away!""",m
18882,"""Good God,"" he thought, ""they're hunting a woman!""",m
18883,The drunken men had answered that sobbing appeal with a regular view-halloo of drunken laughter.,m
18884,Mr. Bob Jonstone stepped slowly forward.,m
18885,"His thin face had a bluish, steely look; and his eyes glinted wickedly like a rattlesnake's.",m
18886,"Being one against four, he made no declaration of war.",m
18887,He came upon them secretly from behind.,m
18888,"And first he struck a thin neck just below a leathery ear, and then a fat neck.",m
18889,He was not a strong man physically.,m
18890,"But high-strung nerves and cold, collected loathing and fury are powerful weapons.",m
18891,"The thin man and the fat man with the whispering voice lay face down on the beach and passed from insensibility into stupefied, drunken sleep.",m
18892,"But with the other two, Mr. Jonstone had a bad time of it, for he had broken a bone in his right hand and the pain was excruciating.",m
18893,"Often, during that battle, he thought of the deadly automatic in his pocket.",m
18894,"But if he used that, it meant that a woman's name would be printed in the newspaper.",m
18895,The fat men fought hard with drunken fury.,m
18896,"Their strength was their weight, and they were always coming at him from opposite sides.",m
18897,But an empty whiskey bottle caught Mr. Jonstone's swift eye and made a sudden end of what its contents had begun.,m
18898,"He hit five times and then stood alone, among the fallen, a bottle neck of brown glass in his hand.",m
18899,"Then he lifted his voice and spoke aloud, as if to the island:  ""They'll not trouble you now.",m
18900,"What else can I do?""",m
18901,"""God bless you for doing what you've done!",m
18902,"I'm a fool girl, and I thought I was all alone and I went in swimming, and they came and I hid on the island.",m
18903,"And I--I haven't got my things with me!""",m
18904,"""Couldn't you get ashore without being seen?",m
18905,These beasts won't look.,m
18906,And I won't look.,m

18908,"""When you tell me that nobody is looking I'll come ashore.""",m
18909,"""Nobody is looking now.""",m
18910,He heard a splash and sounds as of strong swimming.,m
18911,And he was dying to look.,m
18912,"He took out his little automatic and cocked it, and he said to himself: ""If you do look, Bob, you get shot.""",m
18913,Ten minutes passed.,m
18914,"""Are you all right?"" he called.",m
18915,"""Yes, thank you, all right now.",m
18916,But how can I thank you?,m
18917,"I don't want you to see me, if you don't mind.",m
18918,I don't want you to know who I am.,m

18922,Mr. Jonstone's hair fairly bristled with emotion.,m

18924,The answer came from farther off.,m
18925,"""Yes, I think so.",m
18926,"Some time.""",m
18927,"""Do you promise that?""",m
18928,"Silence--and then:  ""I _almost_ promise.""",m
18929,"*       *       *       *       *  Having assured himself that the drunken men were not dead, Mr. Jonstone sighed like a furnace and started down the mountain.",m
18930,"His hand hurt him like the devil, but the pain was first cousin to delight.",m
18931,XXVII   The Camp was much concerned to hear of poor Mr. Jonstone's accident.,m
18932,"A round stone, he said, had rolled suddenly under his foot and precipitated him down a steep pitch of path.",m
18933,"He had put out his hands to save his face and, it seemed, broken a bone in one of them.",m
18934,"And at that, the attempted rescue of his face had not been an overwhelming success.",m
18935,It was not until the doctor had come and gone that Mr. Jonstone told his cousin what had really happened.,m
18936,Colonel Meredith was much excited and intrigued by the narrative.,m
18937,"""And you've no idea who she was?"" he asked.",m
18938,"""No, Mel;",m
18939,I've thought that the voice was familiar.,m

18944,"""Voices,"" said Colonel Meredith, ""are beautiful things.",m

18949,"""You feel mighty uncomfortable, don't you, Bob?""",m
18950,The invalid nodded.,m
18951,"He was pale as a sheet, and he could not keep still.",m
18952,He had received considerable physical punishment and his entire nervous system was quivering and jumping.,m

18958,"""Let's all go.""",m
18959,"""I think I won't,"" said Eve, looking wonderfully cool and serene.",m
18960,"""But I'll walk down to the float and see you off.",m
18961,"What a pity for a man to get laid up by an accident that might have been avoided by a little attention!""",m
18962,Colonel Meredith stiffened.,m
18963,"""I am sorry to contradict a lady,"" he said, ""but my cousin has given me the particulars of his accident, and it was of a nature that could hardly have been avoided by a man.",m
18964,"I think, Miss Maud, if you will order a launch, I had better tell my cousin where I am going, in case he should feel that he was being neglected.""",m
18965,"""Don't bother to do that,"" said Eve.",m

18973,"Can you hear me?""",m
18974,With a sort of shudder of wonder Mr. Jonstone sat up in his bed.,m

18987,"""My name is a very, very old name, and I look like a lot of other people.",m

19057,"XXVIII   A point of land just across the lake from the camp belonged to the Darlings' mother, the Princess Oducalchi.",m
19058,One night the light of fires and lanterns appeared on this point and the next morning it was seen to be studded here and there with pale-brown tents.,m
19059,The Darlings were annoyed to think that any one should trespass on so large a scale on some one else's land.,m
19060,"In a code of laws shot to pieces with class legislation, trespassers are, of course, exempt from punishment; their presence and depredations in one's private melon-patch are none the less disagreeable, and Arthur Darling, as his mother's representative, was peculiarly enraged.",m

19066,"Why should education be forced on children in a country where education, which means good manners and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, amounts practically to disfranchisement?",m
19067,"Arthur, in his political ruminations, could never get beyond such questions as these.",m
19068,"If A has paid for and owns a piece of land, why is it not A's to enjoy, rather than B's, whose sole claim thereto is greater strength of body than A, and the desire to possess those things which are not his?",m
19069,"At least, Arthur could row across to the point and protest in his mother's name.",m
19070,"If the trespassers were gentlefolk who imagined themselves to have camped upon public land, they would, of course, offer to go and to pay all damages--in which event, Arthur would invite them to stay as long as they pleased, only begging that they would not set the woods on fire.",m
19071,"If, however, the trespassers belonged to one of the privileged classes for whose benefit the laws are made and continued, he would simply be abused roundly and perhaps vilely.",m
19072,"He would then take a thrashing at the hands of superior numbers, and the incident would be closed.",m

19113,"And if he had done that he might very likely have drowned, so paralyzing in effect were those first moments of unbelievable joy and astonishment.",m
19114,"Then she waved her hand to him and swiftly crossed the beach, and he began to paddle like a madman.",m
19115,"When the canoe beached with sudden finality, Arthur simply made a flying leap to the shore and caught her in his arms.",m
19116,"Then he held her at arm's length, and if eyes could eat, these would have been the last moments upon earth of a very lovely young woman.",m
19117,Then a sort of horror of what he had done and of what he was doing seized him.,m
19118,His hands dropped to his sides and the pupils of his eyes became pointed with pain.,m

19174,"Andrea wore a bright-red sweater, carried a fine twenty-bore gun made by a famous London smith, and looked every inch a prince.",m

19190,"And then Princess Oducalchi came out of her tent, and proved that, although her daughters resembled her in features, simplicity, and grace and dignity of carriage, they would never really vie with her in beauty until they had loved much, suffered much, borne children into the world, and remembered all that was good in things and forgotten all that was evil.",m
19191,"""Mamma,"" said Arthur, ""is worth travelling ten thousand miles to see any day, isn't she?""",m

19234,"At this moment Andrea appeared at the tent opening and announced in his piping child voice: ""The canoe is overboard, papa.""",m
19235,"XXX   Andrea stuck to his big brother like a leech, and insisted upon crossing to The Camp in the same canoe with him and Cecily.",m
19236,To Andrea the possibility of newly engaged persons wishing to be by themselves was negligible.,m
19237,"Princess Oducalchi, an old hand on inland waters, took charge of the other canoe, and, like Arthur, in spite of a look of resigned horror on her husband's face, paddled standing up.",m

19290,"Clement, who takes the Low road, cannot but be disturbed at the thought of those possible adventures which lie in wait for Covington, who has fared forth by the High.",m

19292,"Nobody expressed this feeling or acknowledged it or recognized in it anything more than a feeling of unrest; but it existed, nevertheless, and had its effect upon actions and affections.",m
19293,Renier had been leading a life of almost perfect happiness.,m
19294,For the things that made him happy were the same sort of things that make boys happy.,m
19295,"No school; no parental obstructions or admonitions; green-and-blue days filled from end to end with fishing, sailing, making fires, shooting at marks, and perfecting himself in physical attainments.",m
19296,"Add to these things the digestion and the faculties of a healthy boy interested neither in drink, tobacco, nor in any book which failed to contain exciting and chivalrous adventures, and, above all, a companion whose tastes and sympathies were such that she might just as well have been a boy as not.",m
19297,They were chums rather than sweethearts.,m

19337,She nodded.,m
19338,"""That's funny, isn't it?",m

19340,Maybe it's the excitement of the Oducalchis' arrival and your brother's engagement.,m
19341,"It makes you sort of feel as if there wasn't time to settle back into the regular life and get things going again before the leaves fall.""",m
19342,He spoke.,m
19343,"And from the fine striped maple under which they sat there fell, and fluttered slowly into Lee's lap, a great yellowing leaf ribbed with incipient scarlet.",m
19344,"""That only means,"" said Renier--but there was a kind of awe in his voice--""that this particular tree has indigestion.""",m
19345,And they sat for a time in silence and looked at the leaf.,m

19359,"Lee shook her head sadly, and said: ""Once an accepted lover, always a sure thing, man.",m
19360,"Oh, Arthur, how low you have fallen!",m
19361,You used to engineer bets with me for the sheer joy of seeing me win them.,m
19362,"But now you are on the make, and it looks as if there was no justice under heaven-- Where do you want us to go and what do you want us to do when we get there?",m
19363,"Of course, we'll go; we always do.",m
19364,"Everybody sends us on errands, and we always go.",m
19365,The longer the errands the oftener we go.,m
19366,But nobody seems to realize that we might enjoy spending one single solitary afternoon sitting under a striped maple and watching the green leaves turn yellow.,m
19367,Nobody even loves us!,m
19368,"But when we are dead there will be the most frightful remorse and sorrow.""",m
19369,Arthur leaned heavily against the stem of the striped maple.,m
19370,"""Your sad case,"" he said, ""certainly cries aloud for justice and redress----""  ""'Kid us along, Bo,'"" said Lee;",m
19371,"""we love it!""",m
19372,"""I want two people,"" said Arthur, ""for whom I have affection and in whom I have confidence, to go at once to Carrytown in the _Streak_ and consult a lawyer upon a matter of paramount importance and delicacy--"" He hesitated, and Lee said:  ""I pray you, without further ado, continue your piquant narrative.""",m
19373,"Then Arthur, in a tone of solemn, confidential eagerness:  ""Look here, you two, go to Carrytown, will you, and find out how quickly two people can get married in the State of New York, and what they have to do about licenses and things?",m
19374,Will you?,m
19375,"I'll be eternally obliged.""",m
19376,"""Of course, we will,"" exclaimed Lee in sudden excitement.",m
19377,"""Are you game?""",m
19378,"""You bet your sweet life I'm game!"" cried the vulgar Renier.",m
19379,"And a few minutes later the two inseparable school-boyesque chums, whom nobody mentioned, whom everybody sent on errands, and whom nobody even loved, were streaking across the lake in the _Streak_.",m
19380,There was but the one lawyer in Carrytown and the one stenographer.,m
19381,Their shingles hang one above the other on the face of the one brick building.,m
19382,At the door of this building Lee suddenly drew back.,m
19383,"""Look here!"" she said.",m
19384,"""Won't it look rather funny if we march in hand in hand and say: 'Beg pardon, sir, but how do you get married in the State of New York?'""  ""It _would_ look funny,"" said Renier, ""and I shouldn't wonder if it made us feel funny.",m
19385,But the joke would really be on the lawyer.,m
19386,We could say '_Honi soit qui mal y pense_' to him.,m
19387,"Of course, if it would really embarrass you----""  ""It wouldn't,"" said Lee, ""_really_.""",m
19388,So they went up a narrow flight of stairs and knocked on the door of room Number Five.,m

19412,"And the stout young man said:  ""Caught with the goods!",m
19413,"Jump up, Minnie, and behave yourself!""",m
19414,Minnie's upspring was almost a record-breaker.,m

19423,"""It--it's for another fellow.""",m
19424,"""Friend of yours?"" queried the stout young man.",m
19425,"""Yes.""",m

19436,"At the finish of this improvisation the dreadfully confused Minnie went, ""Tee-hee!""",m

19445,"""You,"" cried Lee, in a sudden blaze of indignation, ""are the freshest, most objectionable American I ever set eyes on.""",m
19446,The stout young man turned appealingly to Renier.,m
19447,"""You wouldn't say that,"" he said;",m
19448,"""you'd say I was just typical, wouldn't you, now?",m

19450,During the last words of this speech he became appealingly wistful.,m
19451,"""Why,"" said he to Lee, ""just because Minnie and me is stout, don't you think we know heaven when we see it--the empyrean!",m
19452,"Yesterday she threw me down, and I says to her: 'Since all my life seems meant for ""fails""--since this was written and needs must be--my whole soul rises up to bless your name in pride and thankfulness.",m
19453,Who knows but the world may end to-night?',m
19454,To-day she sits in my lap and we see which can hug the hardest.,m
19455,"Ever try that?""",m
19456,And suddenly the creature's voice melted and shook.,m
19457,"He was a genuine orator, as we Americans understand it, having that within his powers of voice that defies logic and melts the heart.",m
19458,"""Wouldn't you,"" he said, ""even _like_ to sit in his lap?",m
19459,"Wouldn't you _love_ to sit in his lap and be hugged?""",m
19460,"Lee looked to Renier for help, as he to her.",m
19461,"And they took a step apiece directly toward each other, and another step.",m
19462,It was as if they had been hypnotized.,m
19463,"Suddenly Renier caught Lee's hand in his, and after a moment of looking into his eyes she turned to the stout man, and sang in miraculous imitation of him:    ""Young Miss Mule is a gol-darn fool,   But you made her see the water in the gol-darn pool.""",m
19464,"""I'll just get a license blank,"" said the stout young man.",m

19466,"""Thank you,"" said Renier--""if you will, Mr.----""  ""Heartbeat!"" flashed the stout young man, and left them.",m
19467,And he wasn't lying or making fun that time.,m
19468,For that was his really truly name.,m
19469,And in northern New York people are beginning to think that he is by way of being up to it.,m
19470,Suddenly Lee quoted from a joke that she and Renier had in common.,m
19471,"She said, as if surprised:  ""'Why, there's a table over there!'""  And Renier, his voice suddenly breaking and melting, answered:  ""'Why, so there is--and here's a chair!'""  And Mr. Heartbeat, making a supreme effort to live up to his name, did not return with the license blank for nearly eight minutes.",m
19472,"During those minutes, Renier resolved that in every room in his home there should be at least one revolving chair.",m
19473,"And they came out of Mr. Heartbeat's office no longer boyish companions but lovers, a little startled, engaged, and licensed to be married.",m
19474,"XXXII   ""Lee, dear,"" said Renier, ""you don't feel that that fellow buncoed you into this, do you?",m
19475,"Please say you don't.""",m
19476,"""Of course, I wasn't buncoed,"" she said, and with infinite confidence.",m

19481,"And I hereby highly resolve that after this perilous trip I shall never again do anything dangerous, such as watching people going up in aeroplanes, such as sitting around with wet feet, such as eating green fruit, such as-- Oh, my own darling little kiddie,"" he whispered with sudden trembling emotion, ""but this life is precious.""",m
19482,"""George and Charley are looking at us,"" said Lee, ""with funny looks.",m

19484,I wonder if everybody will be _on_--just by looking at us.,m
19485,"_Do_ I look foolish?""",m
19486,"""You do not, but I think you are foolish to take a feller like me, and that's why I'm going to dance down this gang-plank and snap my fingers and shock George and Charley out of their senses.""",m
19487,During this first part of the _Streak_'s swift rush from Carrytown to The Camp a tranquil silence came over them.,m
19488,"Lee, I think, was searching her heart with questions.",m
19489,But she had no doubt of her love for Renier; she doubted only her capacity to be to him exactly the wife he needed.,m
19490,"And I know that Renier just sat, brazening the critical glances of George and Charley, and adored her with his eyes.",m
19491,And what were his thoughts?,m
19492,Would you give a penny for them?,m
19493,"He leaned closer to her, and in a whisper that thrilled them both to the bone, he quoted from Poe:    ""And neither the angels in heaven above,     Nor the demons down under the sea,   Can ever dissever my soul from the soul     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.""",m
19494,"And a little later he said:  ""I never knew till to-day what poetry is for.",m
19495,"I thought people who wrote it were just a little simple and that people who read and quoted it were perfect jackasses.""",m
19496,"""And what is poetry for?"" asked Lee, smiling.",m
19497,"""Poetry,"" he said, ""is for _you_.""",m
19498,As they neared the camp the sentiment in their hearts yielded a little to excitement.,m
19499,"""When we tell 'em,"" said Lee, ""it's going to be just like a bomb going off.",m
19500,"And everybody will be terribly envious.""",m
19501,"""Nobody even loves us,"" laughed Renier, and he quoted:    ""Among ten million, one was she,   And surely all men hated me.""",m
19502,"And like a flash Lee answered:    ""Among ten million he was one,   So all the ladies fought like fun.""",m
19503,"""One thing is sure,"" sand Renier, ""we've more than executed Brother Arthur's delicate and confidential commission.",m
19504,"What we don't know about getting married in the State of New York simply doesn't exist.""",m
19505,"Arthur, eager and impatient, was like a more famous person, watching and waiting.",m
19506,"""Well,"" he said, ""thank you a thousand times.",m
19507,"And what did you find out?""",m
19508,"""We've brought you a license blank,"" said Lee;",m
19509,"""you simply fill it out with your names and ages and things--like this--"" And she placed a second paper in her brother's hands.",m
19510,And conspicuous on the paper he saw Lee's name and Renier's.,m
19511,"His hands shook a little, and his face became very grave and tender.",m
19512,"""Say you're surprised!"" exclaimed Lee;",m
19513,"""say you were never so surprised in all your born days!""",m
19514,"""But I'm not surprised,"" said Arthur.",m
19515,"""Come here to me!""",m
19516,He opened his arms to her and she flung herself into them.,m
19517,Over her shoulder and hiding head Arthur spoke to Renier.,m
19518,"""No man,"" he said, ""knows his own heart, and no woman knows hers.",m
19519,Nobody can promise with honesty to love forever.,m
19520,For sometimes love dies just as simply and inexplicably as it is born.,m
19521,"But a man can promise to be good to his wife always, and tender with her and faithful to her, and if he is a gentleman he will make those promises good.""",m
19522,"""I make those promises,"" said Renier simply;",m
19523,"""will you give her to me?""",m
19524,"""It is for no man to give or to withhold,"" said Arthur.",m
19525,"""The gods give.",m

19528,"On the way to find the princess, Lee and Renier encountered Herring.",m
19529,"He appeared to be hurrying, but something in their faces brought him to a sudden stop.",m
19530,"Their attempts to meet his inquiring gaze with indifference proved unavailing, for he closed one eye and said:  ""Which of you two has swallowed the family canary?",m
19531,"Or has each of you swallowed half of him?""",m
19532,The guilty pair were unable to preserve their natural coloring.,m
19533,"They turned crimson, and each showed a courteous willingness to let the other be the first to speak.",m
19534,"""You've been to Carrytown,"" said Herring.",m
19535,"""I saw you start.",m
19536,You raced down to the float.,m
19537,"And in your rivalry to see which should board the _Streak_ first, it looked as if you were going to knock each other overboard.",m
19538,"Renier, he won, and you, Miss Lee, were annoyed.",m
19539,"When you returned from Carrytown, you had long, pensive, anxious faces.",m
19540,"Renier stepped ashore and, in helping you ashore, gave you both hands.",m
19541,"When a girl whom I have seen climb a tree after a baby owl accepts the aid of a man's two hands in stepping from a solid boat to a solid float, there is food for thought.",m
19542,"Having landed, you proceeded direct to the head of the Darling family and were for some time engaged with him in solemn discourse.",m
19543,A paper was shown him.,m
19544,"From a distance it looked as if it might be some sort of a license--a license to hunt and be hunted, perhaps----""  ""But it wasn't,"" said Lee suddenly, and she thrust her hand under Renier's arm.",m
19545,"""If you must know, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, it was a license to love and be loved.",m
19546,"So there!""",m
19547,"She was no longer blinking, nor was Renier.",m
19548,They looked so loving and proud that it was Herring's turn to feel embarrassment.,m
19549,"Then he said:  ""I only meant to be a tease.",m
19550,"If I'd really thought anything--I wouldn't, of course; none of my darn business.",m
19551,But I'm _awfully_ glad.,m
19552,I've hoped all along it would happen.,m
19553,It's the best ever.,m
19554,"Am I to be secret as the grave or can I tell--any one I happen to meet?""",m
19555,"""Give us ten minutes to tell mamma,"" said Lee, ""and then consider your lips unsealed.""",m
19556,Herring had drawn from his pocket a stop-watch and set it going.,m
19557,"""Ten minutes,"" he said.",m
19558,"""Thanks awfully!",m
19559,"And good luck!""",m
19560,"He had turned, waving his free hand to them, and darted away.",m
19561,Lee laughed scornfully.,m
19562,"""Any one he happens to meet!"" she exclaimed.",m
19563,"""He's headed straight for the garden, and there he'll just _happen_ to meet Phyllis.",m
19564,"She was speaking of her tomatoes at breakfast, and saying that they ought to be ripening and that she was going to have a look at them.""",m
19565,"""Lee, darling,"" said Renier, ""nobody can possibly see us.",m
19566,And when Mr. Heartbeat left us alone in the front room it was a frightfully long time ago.,m
19567,"And sometimes a fellow's arms get to aching with sheer emptiness, and--and, 'this is the forest primeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks----'""  ""Are mostly birches and larches hereabouts,"" said Lee, and, with a happy laugh, she drifted into a pair of arms that closed tightly about her.",m
19568,"And, ""It doesn't matter if anybody does see us,"" she said.",m
19569,*       *       *       *       *  It was characteristic of Herring that he should enter the garden by leaping over the fence.,m
19570,It was also characteristic that he should catch his foot on the top rail and fall at full length in a bed of very beautiful and much cherished phlox.,m
19571,"Phyllis, in the path near by, gazed at the fallen man with mirth and anxiety.",m
19572,"""Hurt?"" she asked.",m
19573,He rose and examined a watch which he was carrying in his right hand.,m
19574,"""Crystal smashed,"" he said, ""but still going.",m
19575,"And I've got to wait four minutes!""",m
19576,"""Why have you got to wait four minutes?""",m
19577,"""Because I promised to wait ten, and six of them have elapsed.",m
19578,"Oh, but won't you be excited when I am at liberty to speak!",m
19579,"It's more exciting than when we were lost in the woods, crossing the swamp that had never been crossed before.",m
19580,"Meanwhile, let us calm ourselves by talking of something prosaic.",m
19581,"How are the tomatoes getting on?""",m
19582,Phyllis put up her hand in a smiling military salute.,m
19583,"""'General Blank's compliments,'"" she said, ""'and the colored troops are turning black in the face.'""  ""My favorite breakfast dish,"" said Herring, ""is grilled tomatoes, preceded by raw oysters and oatmeal.""",m
19584,"""Isn't it nice,"" said Phyllis, ""that there is money in the family after all, and we're going to give up The Camp as an inn?""",m
19585,"""It would have been given up anyway,"" said Herring.",m
19586,"""A determined body of men had so resolved in secret.",m
19587,"There's one minute left.""",m
19588,For some reason they found nothing to say during the whole of that minute.,m
19589,"When the last second thereof had passed forever, Herring said simply:  ""Your sister Lee and Renier are going to be married.""",m
19590,I cannot describe the expression that came over Phyllis's face.,m
19591,It wasn't exactly jealousy; it wasn't exactly the expression of a beautiful female commuter who has just missed her train.,m
19592,"It wasn't a wild look, or a happy look, or a sad look.",m
19593,Perhaps it was a little bit more of an aching void look than anything else.,m
19594,"Whatever its exact nature, the wily Herring studied it with an immense satisfaction.",m
19595,And then his heart began to flurry in a sort of panic.,m
19596,"""Lee!"" exclaimed Phyllis, ""married!",m
19597,"Why, they're nothing but children!""",m
19598,She felt something encircle her waist.,m
19599,She looked down and saw a hand and part of an arm.,m
19600,"""What are you doing?"" she asked, in a sort of daze.",m
19601,"""I'm trying to establish a hold on you,"" said Herring, and toward the end of so saying his voice broke;",m
19602,"""and you're not to feel lonely and deserted with me standing here, are you?""",m
19603,For a moment it seemed to Herring that Phyllis was going to extricate herself from his encircling arm.,m
19604,"She achieved, indeed, a quarter revolution to the left and away from him.",m
19605,"""Don't, Phyllis!"" he cried.",m
19606,"""Don't do it!",m
19607,"I couldn't bear it!""",m
19608,"Then she ceased revolving to the left, stopped, and from a startled, uncertain, half-frightened young person became suddenly a warmly loving young person, warmly loved, who revolved suddenly to the right, and became the recipient of a sudden storm of ecstatic exclamations and kisses.",m
19609,"And then, nestling close to the one and only man in the world, she listened with complete satisfaction to his efforts to explain to her just how beautiful and wonderful and good she was.",m
19610,"XXXIV   When Lee and Renier, locked in each other's arms, stood in the forest primeval, they were mistaken in imagining themselves to be unobserved.",m
19611,"A short half-hour before, Mary Darling had received a proposal of marriage.",m
19612,"But Mr. Sam Langham, usually so worldly-wise, had erred, perhaps, in his choice of time and place.",m
19613,"Whatever a huge kitchen, bright with sunlight upon burnished copper, may be, it is not a romantic place.",m
19614,"And, worse than this, Mary herself was not in a romantic mood.",m
19615,Certain supplies due by the morning express had not arrived.,m
19616,"Chef was at the telephone shouting broken French to the butcher in Carrytown; one of the kitchen-maids had come down with an aching tooth, and the other had been sent upon an errand from which she should have long since returned.",m
19617,"""Oh,"" exclaimed Mary, as Mr. Langham entered, smiling, ""everything is in such a mess!",m
19618,I don't believe there's going to be any lunch to-day for any one.,m
19619,"And I think I shall have a nervous breakdown!""",m
19620,"""I told you you would long ago,"" said Langham, ""if you didn't rest more and take things easier.",m

19622,"And if there isn't going to be any lunch, I'm glad, for one.",m
19623,"I was thinking of not eating mine, anyway.",m
19624,"And if _I'm_ not hungry, you can be pretty sure that nobody else is hungry.",m

19638,"And knowing it, you've never even shown that it interested you; and so I suppose it's folly for me to mention it.",m
19639,"But a man can't give up all his hopes of happiness in this world without even stating them, can he?",m
19640,"I've hoped that you might get to care a little about me----""  Mary interrupted him with considerable impatience.",m
19641,"""Really,"" she said, ""with Chef shouting at the telephone, and all, I don't know what you are driving at.""",m
19642,At that Mr. Langham looked so hurt and so unhappy and woebegone that Mary was touched with remorse.,m

19651,After he had gone Mary stood for a while with knitted brows.,m

19657,"And she left the kitchen with great swiftness, looking like an angel on the verge of tears.",m
19658,"Chef's shining red face divided into a white smile, and he began to bustle about and make a noise with pots and pans and carving tools, and to sing as he bustled:    ""_Sur le pont d'Avignon_   _L'on y danse, l'on y danse_,   _Sur le pont d'Avignon_   _L'on y danse tout en rond--_   _Les belles dames font comm'ca_,   _Et puis encore comm'ca._""  It is probable that in his gay Parisian youth Chef had known a good deal about _les belles dames_.",m
19659,"He had latterly given much attention to the progress of Miss Darling's friendship with Mr. Langham, and that this same progress had received a sharp setback under his very nose concerned him not a little.",m
19660,"Chef possessed altogether too much currency that had once belonged to that lavish tipper, Mr. Langham.",m
19661,And Chef did not wish Mr. Langham to be driven from the kitchen and The Camp.,m
19662,He wished Mr. Langham to become a permanent Darling asset--like himself and the French range.,m
19663,"And so, half singing, half speaking, and furiously bustling, he announced:  ""I'll show her how little difference she makes.",m
19664,"Without advice or dictation, practically without supplies of any kind, I shall arrange, _nom de Dieu!_ a luncheon which, for pure deliciousness, will not have been surpassed during the entire Christian era.",m
19665,"I shall hint to her that I tolerate her in my kitchen because I have known her since she was a little girl, but I shall make it clear by words and deeds that her presence or absence is not of the least importance.",m
19666,"Let her then turn for comfort to the worthy, generous, and rich Mr. Langham, for whom the mere poaching of an egg is an exquisite pleasure!""",m
19667,And he frowned and began to think formidable and inventive thoughts about matters connected with his craft and immediate needs and necessities.,m
19668,"Mary Darling had, of late, often imagined herself receiving an offer of marriage from Mr. Langham.",m
19669,That is badly expressed.,m
19670,Only the most insufferable and self-sufficient of men make offers of marriage.,m
19671,"Your true, modest, and chivalrous lover gets down on his real or figurative knees and begs and beseeches.",m
19672,"She had, then, often imagined her hand in the act of being besought by Mr. Langham.",m
19673,"Being a practical young woman, she had pictured this as happening (repeatedly) at sunset, by moonlight, in the depths of romantic forests or on the tops of romantic mountains.",m
19674,And some voice in her (some very practical voice) told her that it never should have happened in a kitchen.,m
19675,"Mr. Langham's ""sweet beseeching"", instead of ""moving her strangely,"" had made her rather cross.",m
19676,And such tenderness as she usually had for him had fled to cover.,m
19677,"But now, as the clean, green forest closed about her, she had a reaction.",m
19678,She came to a dead stop and realized that she had been through an emotional crisis.,m
19679,"Her heart was beating as if she had just finished a steep, swift climb.",m
19680,"And her heart was aching too, aching for the kind and gentle friend and well-wisher to whom she had been so inexplicably cold and cutting.",m
19681,It was in vain to mourn for that diamond of a heart which she had rejected with so much finality.,m

19685,"Perhaps, even now he was causing his things to be packed with a view to leaving The Camp for ever and a day.",m
19686,But what could she do?,m
19687,Could she go to him (in person or by writing) and in his presence eat as much as a single mouthful of humble-pie?,m
19688,"No, she could not possibly do that.",m
19689,"Then, what could she do?",m
19690,"Well, with the usual negligible results, she could cry her eyes out over the spilt milk.",m
19691,"She went swiftly forward, the shadows dappling her as she went, and her heart swelling and swelling with self-pity and general miserableness.",m
19692,Thoughts of Arthur and his happiness flashed through her mind.,m
19693,"The thought that she, Mary Darling, unmarried, would in the course of a few years be called an old maid, caused her a panicky feeling.",m
19694,"She pictured herself as very old (and very ugly), exhibiting improbable Chinese dogs at dog-shows and scowling at rosy babies.",m
19695,And I must say she almost laughed.,m
19696,The path turned sharply to the right and disclosed to Mary's eyes two young people who stood locked in each other's arms and rocked slightly from side to side--rocked with ineffable delight and tenderness.,m
19697,"She stood stock-still, in plain view if they had looked her way, until presently they unlocked arms, drew a little apart, and had a good long look at each other, and then turned their backs upon that part of the forest and departed slowly.",m
19698,"Whither she was going, Mary did not know.",m
19699,But she went very swiftly and had upon her face the expression of a beautiful female commuter who has arrived at the station just in time to see her train pull out.,m
19700,"But this expression changed when she found her path blocked by the diminutive house in which Sam Langham lived, and saw Sam Langham, a look of wonder on his face, rise from his big piazza chair and come toward her.",m
19701,"""Lee and Renier are going to be married,"" she exclaimed, all out of breath, ""and I didn't mean to be such a brute!",m
19702,"And I wouldn't have hurt you for anything in the world!""",m
19703,"Sam Langham only looked at her, for he was afraid to speak.",m
19704,"""I'm just an old goose,"" said Mary humbly, but very bravely, ""and I take everything back.",m
19705,"And if you meant what you said, Sam, and want to begin all over again, why, don't just stand there and look at me.""",m
19706,"And presently she was ashamed of herself for having been so forward, and so she pursued the feelings of shame to their logical conclusion and hid her face.",m
19707,"And now, for the first time, she realized how hard she had worked ever since The Camp was changed into an inn to make it a go, and how much she needed rest and comforting and a masculine executive to lean on.",m
19708,"""Who said,"" murmured the ecstatic Langham, ""that nothing good ever came of liking good things to eat?""",m
19709,"""Sam,"" said Mary, ""I'm so happy I don't care if lunch is burned to a cinder.""",m
19710,It wasn't.,m
19711,"Out of odds and ends of raw materials, and great slugs and gallons of culinary genius, Chef produced a lunch that transcended even Mary's and Langham's belief in him.",m
19712,But it was Arthur who insisted that champagne be opened; and perhaps the champagne made the lunch seem even more delicious than it really was.,m
19713,Maud and Eve had already discounted Arthur's engagement and Lee's.,m
19714,"They had not, it is true, learned of the latter without feeling that if they didn't hurry they would miss their train; but they had disguised and fought off that feeling until now they were their gay and natural selves.",m
19715,It remained for Mr. Langham to shock them suddenly into a new set of emotions.,m
19716,"""I should be obliged,"" said he, rising to his feet, with a glass of champagne in his hand, ""if everybody would drink the health of the happiest man present.""",m
19717,Arthur and Renier looked very self-conscious.,m
19718,"But Mr. Langham concluded: ""And that man is myself.",m
19719,"I have the honor to announce that, beyond peradventure, the loveliest and sweetest girl in all the world----""  And at that Mary blushed so and looked so happy and beautiful that everybody shouted with joy and surprise and laughter, and drank champagne, and tossed compliments about like shuttlecocks.",m
19720,And Arthur and Renier and Langham had a violent dispute as to which was the happiest; and decided to settle the dispute with sabres at--twenty paces.,m
19721,"Her first burst of surprise and excitement and pleasure having passed, Eve Darling experienced a sudden sinking feeling.",m
19722,She felt as if all the people she most loved to be with were going away on a delightful excursion and that she was being left behind.,m
19723,"It was at this moment, while the uproar was still at its height, that she heard the shaken voice of Mr. Bob Jonstone in her ear.",m
19724,"""How about us?"" he demanded.",m
19725,"""How about us--what?"" she answered.",m
19726,"Then she felt her hand seized and held in the secret asylum furnished by the table-cloth, and there stole over her the solaceful feeling of having been asked at the last moment to go upon the delightful excursion.",m
19727,"""Eve?""",m
19728,"""Eve, darling--is it all right?""",m
19729,"""All right.""",m
19730,"And then up shot Mr. Jonstone like a projectile from a howitzer, and he cried aloud, his habitual calmness and lazy habit of speech flung to the winds.",m
19731,"""You're not the only happy men in the world,"" he shouted.",m
19732,"""I'm happier than the three of you put together, I am!",m
19733,"Because my Darling is the best and most beautiful of all Darlings, and if any man dares to gainsay that, let him just step outside with me for five minutes--that's all.""",m
19734,Colonel Meredith's hair bristled like the mane of a fighting terrier.,m
19735,"""Do you mean to say,"" he whispered to Maud in a sort of savage whisper, ""that I've got to swallow that insult without protest?""",m
19736,It was on the tip of Maud's tongue to say that she didn't know what he meant.,m
19737,But how could she say that when she knew perfectly well?,m
19738,"""Only give me the right to answer him,"" continued the sincere warrior.",m
19739,He rose to his feet.,m
19740,"""Is it yes--or no?""",m
19741,"""It's yes--yes,"" exclaimed Maud and, horrified with herself, she leaned back blushing and full of wonder.",m
19742,"""Mr. Jonstone--Mr. Bob--Jonstone!"" cried Colonel Meredith.",m
19743,"Mr. Jonstone's attention was presently attracted, and he gave his cousin a glittering look.",m
19744,"""I'll be only too delighted to step outside with you for five minutes,"" said Colonel Meredith.",m
19745,And the cousins glared and glared at each other.,m
19746,"But whether or not they were really in earnest, if only for a moment, will never be known; at any rate, each of them appeared suddenly to perceive something comic about the other, and both burst into peals of schoolboy laughter.",m
19747,"Only Gay's happiness seemed a little forced, and her mother's.",m
19748,XXXV   Gay hardly slept at all.,m
19749,She was at her window half the night asking troubled questions of the stars and of the moon and of the moonlight on the lake.,m
19750,"She had not, during the summer, taken her sisters' affairs very seriously, perhaps because she was so seriously engrossed with her own.",m
19751,"She had, even in her heart, almost accused them of flirting and carrying on lest time hang heavy on their hands.",m
19752,"Her own romance she had supposed all along to be real, the others mere reflections of romantic places and situations.",m
19753,But it began to look as if only her own romance had been spurious.,m
19754,It was a long time since she had heard from Pritchard.,m
19755,"He had told her very simply that he was now the Earl of Merrivale, and that, as soon as certain things were settled and arranged, he intended to return to America.",m
19756,"After that, there had been no word from him of any kind.",m
19757,"She tried to comfort herself with the thought that if he was that kind of man--blow hot, blow cold--she was well rid of him, and she failed dismally.",m
19758,A man is in love with a certain girl.,m
19759,"He learns that she is vain, gay, extravagant, heartless, and going to marry some other man.",m
19760,Does any of this comfort him?,m
19761,"Not if he is in love with her, it doesn't.",m
19762,Not a bit.,m
19763,"So Gay could say to herself: ""He's thoughtless and inconstant, and I'm well out of it!""",m
19764,"She could say that, and she did say that, and then she buried her face in her pillow and cried very quietly and very hard.",m
19765,She was up before the sun.,m
19766,It would have taken more than one night of wakefulness and weeping to leave marks upon that lovely face which sudden cold water and the resolution to suffer no more could not erase.,m
19767,But she had not rowed a mile or more before the color in her cheeks was really vivid again and the whites of her eyes showed no traces of tears.,m
19768,She did not know why she was rowing or whither.,m
19769,"It was as if some strong hand had forced her from bed before sunrise, forced her into her fishing-clothes, forced her into a guide boat, placed oars in her hands, and compelled her to row.",m
19770,"She even smiled, wondering where she was going.",m
19771,"""I can go anywhere I like,"" she thought;",m
19772,"""but I don't want to go anywhere in particular, and yet I am quite obviously on my way to somewhere or other.",m
19773,I'm like Alice in Wonderland.,m
19774,"I think I'll go to Carrytown and get the morning mail.""",m
19775,"But she had no sooner beached toward Carrytown than the distance there seemed unutterably long, especially for a rower who had yet to breakfast.",m
19776,"""I know,"" thought Gay at last;",m
19777,"""I'll row to Placid Brook and see if the big trout is still feeding in his private preserve.",m
19778,I'll land just where we did before and cross the meadow and spy on him from behind a bush.,m
19779,I wish I'd brought some tackle.,m
19780,"I'd like to catch him and cook him for my breakfast--so I would!""",m
19781,"Upon this resolution, the work of rowing became very light.",m
19782,It was as if the force which had started her upon the excursion had had Placid Brook in mind all the time.,m
19783,"Having laid her course for the meadow at the mouth of Placid Brook, she kept the stern of the boat in direct line with a distant mountain-top, and so held it.",m
19784,"The sun was now peeping over the rim of the world, and here and there morning breezes were darkening and dappling the burnished surface of the lake.",m
19785,"Now and then, as she neared the meadow, Gay glanced over her shoulder, once for quite a long time, resting on her oars, because she thought she saw a doe with a fawn.",m
19786,They turned out to be nothing more tender than a couple of granite rocks.,m
19787,"And once again she rested on her oars and looked for a long time--not this time upon the strength of a hallucination, but of an impulse.",m
19788,"She followed this inconsequential act with a long sigh, and enough strokes of the oar to bring her to land.",m
19789,When she stood upright on the meadow she could see the very spot from which Pritchard had cast for the big trout.,m
19790,And she saw (and had a curious dilating of the heart at the same moment) that that particular spot of meadow was once more occupied by a human being--or were her eyes and her breakfastless stomach playing tricks?,m
19791,A young man in rusty meadow-colored clothes appeared to be kneeling with his back toward her.,m
19792,"She advanced swiftly toward him, curious only of a great wonder and an indescribable (and possibly fatal) beating of her heart.",m
19793,"And suddenly she knew that her man was real and no hallucination, for she perceived at her feet the stub of a Turkish cigarette, still smoking.",m
19794,"Then she called to him:  ""Halloo, there!""",m
19795,"The Earl of Merrivale started as if he had been shot at, then leaped to his feet and turned toward her with a cry of joy.",m
19796,"""What are you doing here?"" he cried.",m
19797,And they had approached to within touching distance of each other.,m
19798,"""I don't know,"" she said.",m
19799,"""What are you?""",m
19800,"""It was too early to pay calls,"" he said, ""so I thought I'd have one more whack at the big char and bring him to you for a present.",m
19801,"But tell me--does our bet still stand?""",m
19802,He looked at her so tenderly and lovingly and hopefully that she hadn't the heart to be anything but tender and loving herself.,m
19803,"""The bet still stands,"" she said, ""if you win.",m
19804,"I've missed you terribly.""",m
19805,"""I took him,"" said the earl.",m
19806,"""I was just weighing him when you called.",m
19807,He weighs a lot more than three pounds.,m
19808,"So I win.""",m
19809,"""Yes, you win.""",m
19810,"""And the bet still stands?""",m
19811,She nodded happily.,m
19812,"""And you won't renege--you'll pay?",m
19813,"You'll be Countess of Merrivale?""",m
19814,"""If you want me to be,"" she said humbly.",m
19815,"""If I want you to be!""",m
19816,And she had imagined herself so often in his arms that she was not now surprised or troubled to find herself there.,m
19817,"""I was so unhappy,"" she said;",m
19818,"""and now I'm so happy.""",m
19819,"And after a little while she said:  ""I'd like to see him.""",m
19820,Presently they stood looking down at the great trout.,m
19821,"""He's done a lot for us, hasn't he?"" said Gay.",m
19822,"""He was the beginning of things.",m
19823,"And it seems sort of a pity----""  ""He's still breathing.",m
19824,He'll live if we put him back.,m
19825,"Shall we?""",m
19826,"""Yes, please.""",m
19827,There was plenty of life and fight in the old trout.,m
19828,"He no sooner felt that water was somewhere under him than he gave a triumphant, indignant flop, tore himself from Merrivale's hands, and disappeared with a splendid, smacking splash.",m
19829,"""Good old boy!"" laughed Merrivale.",m
19830,"""And yet,"" said Gay, ""it's a pity that we couldn't take him back to camp and show him off.",m
19831,"He was the biggest trout I ever saw.""",m
19832,"""He wasn't a trout, dear,"" said Merrivale; and he grinned lovingly at her.",m
19833,"""He was a char.""",m
19834,"""Of course he was,"" said Gay humbly;",m
19835,"""I forgot.""",m
19836,"XXXVI   I wish I could write first, ""The Seven Darlings lived happily ever afterward,"" and then the word ""Finis.""",m
19837,But I cannot end so easily and maintain a reputation for veracity.,m
19838,They can't have lived happily afterward until they are dead--can they?,m
19839,"At the moment they have just closed The Camp after the summer and scattered to their winter homes; that is, all of them except Gay.",m
19840,"The Camp, of course, is no longer an inn.",m
19841,They run it on joint account for themselves and for their friends.,m
19842,And they have delightful times.,m
19843,"Colonel Meredith has built a tremendous house on his ancestral acres, and during the winter Arthur and his wife, the Herrings, the Reniers, the Jonstones, and the Langhams are apt to make it their headquarters.",m
19844,Gay and her young man were to have visited the Merediths this winter.,m
19845,"There was going to be a united family effort to discover the buried silver which Mr. Bob Jonstone sold to his cousin, but of course the great war has upset this excellent plan, together with a good many million other plans, even more excellent and important.",m
19846,The Earl of Merrivale is fighting somewhere in the wet ditches--Gay doesn't know exactly where.,m
19847,"She herself, a red cross on her sleeve, is with one of the field-hospitals, working like a slave to save life.",m
19848,"Because her husband is an Englishman, she didn't think that she could ever be kind to a German or an Austrian, but that turned out to be a whopping big error of judgment.",m
19849,"They all look alike to her now, and her heart almost breaks over them.",m
19850,But I don't know what will become of her if anything happens to Merrivale.,m
19851,I think poor little Gay would just curl up and die.,m
19852,"He is all the world to her, just as she is to him.",m
19853,"Well, they are only one loving couple out of a good many hundred thousands.",m

19858,"He wore no rouge on his face, the almost unnatural pallor of which seemed designedly enhanced by a patch set beneath his right eye.",f
19859,"Brows and lashes were black, the former slanting slightly up at the corners, but his narrow, heavy-lidded eyes were green and strangely piercing.",f

19879,"Solely within the walls of the Chequers lay his world, that inn having been acquired by his great-grandfather as far back as the year 1667, when the jovial Stuart King sat on the English throne, and the Hanoverian Electors were not yet dreamed of.",f
19880,A Tory was Mr. Chadber to the backbone.,f
19881,"None so bitter 'gainst the little German as he, and surely none had looked forward more eagerly to the advent of the gallant Charles Edward.",f
19882,"If he confined his patriotism to drinking success to Prince Charlie's campaign, who shall blame him?",f
19883,"And if, when sundry Whig gentlemen halted at the Chequers on their way to the coast, and, calling for a bottle of Rhenish, bade him toss down a glass himself with a health to his Majesty, again who shall blame Mr. Chadber for obeying?",f
19884,What was a health one way or another when you had rendered active service to two of his Stuart Highness's adherents?,f
19885,"It was Mr. Chadber's boast, uttered only to his admiring Tory neighbours, that he had, at the risk of his own life, given shelter to two fugitives of the disastrous 'Forty-five, who had come so far out of their way as quiet Fallowfield.",f
19886,That no one had set eyes on either of the men was no reason for doubting an honest landlord's word.,f
19887,But no one would have thought of doubting any statement that Mr. Chadber might make.,f
19888,"Mine host of the Chequers was a great personage in the town, being able both to read and to write, and having once, when young, travelled as far north as London town, staying there for ten days and setting eyes on no less a person than the great Duke of Marlborough himself when that gentleman was riding along the Strand on his way to St.",f
19889,James's.,f
19890,"Also, it was a not-to-be-ignored fact that Mr. Chadber's home-brewed ale was far superior to that sold by the landlord of the rival inn at the other end of the village.",f
19891,"Altogether he was a most important character, and no one was more aware of his importance than his worthy self.",f
19892,"To ""gentlemen born,"" whom, he protested, he could distinguish at a glance, he was almost obsequiously polite, but on clerks and underlings, and men who bore no signs of affluence about their persons, he wasted none of his deference.",f
19893,"Thus it was that, when a little green-clad lawyer alighted one day from the mail coach and entered the coffee-room at the Chequers, he was received with pomposity and scarce-veiled condescension.",f
19894,"He was nervous, it seemed, and more than a little worried.",f
19895,"He offended Mr. Chadber at the outset, when he insinuated that he was come to meet a gentleman who might perhaps be rather shabbily clothed, rather short of purse, and even of rather unsavoury repute.",f
19896,Very severely did Mr. Chadber give him to understand that guests of that description were entirely unknown at the Chequers.,f

19927,"Six years drifted slowly by without bringing any news of Lord John, and then, two months ago, journeying from London to Wyncham, Richard's coach had been waylaid, and by a highwayman who proved to be none other than the scapegrace peer.",f
19928,Richard's feelings may be imagined.,f
19929,Lord John had been singularly unimpressed by anything beyond the humour of the situation.,f

19939,"A firm hand was laid on the door-handle, turning it cleanly round.",f
19940,"The door opened to admit a veritable apparition, and was closed again with a snap.",f
19941,"The lawyer found himself gazing at a slight, rather tall gentleman who swept him a profound bow, gracefully flourishing his smart three-cornered hat with one hand and delicately clasping cane and perfumed handkerchief with the other.",f
19942,"He was dressed in the height of the Versailles fashion, with full-skirted coat of palest lilac laced with silver, small-clothes and stockings of white, and waistcoat of flowered satin.",f
19943,"On his feet he wore shoes with high red heels and silver buckles, while a wig of the latest mode, marvellously powdered and curled and smacking greatly of Paris, adorned his shapely head.",f
19944,"In the foaming lace of his cravat reposed a diamond pin, and on the slim hand, half covered by drooping laces, glowed and flashed a huge emerald.",f
19945,"The lawyer stared and stared again, and it was not until a pair of deep blue, rather wistful eyes met his in a quizzical glance, that he found his tongue.",f
19946,"Then a look of astonishment came into his face, and he took a half step forward.",f
19947,"""Master Jack!"" he gasped.",f
19948,"""Master--_Jack_!""",f
19949,The elegant gentleman came forward and held up a reproving hand.,f
19950,"The patch at the corner of his mouth quivered, and the blue eyes danced.",f
19951,"""I perceive that you are not acquainted with me, Mr. Warburton,"" he said, amusement in his pleasant, slightly drawling voice.",f
19952,"""Allow me to present myself: Sir Anthony Ferndale, _a vous servir_!""",f
19953,A gleam of humour appeared in the lawyer's own eyes as he clasped the outstretched hand.,f
19954,"""I think you are perhaps not acquainted with yourself, my lord,"" he remarked drily.",f
19955,"Lord John laid his hat and cane on the small table, and looked faintly intrigued.",f
19956,"""What's your meaning, Mr. Warburton?""",f
19957,"""I am come, my lord, to inform you that the Earl, your father, died a month since.""",f
19958,"The blue eyes widened, grew of a sudden hard, and narrowed again.",f

19960,"Well, well!",f
19961,"Apoplexy, I make no doubt?""",f
19962,The lawyer's lips twitched uncontrollably.,f
19963,"""No, Master Jack; my lord died of heart failure.""",f
19964,"""Say you so?",f
19965,Dear me!,f

19967,In a moment my servant will have induced the _chef_ to serve dinner.,f
19968,"You will honour me, I trust?""",f
19969,"The lawyer murmured his thanks and sat down on the settle, watching the other with puzzled eyes.",f
19970,The Earl drew up a chair for himself and stretched his foot to the fire.,f
19971,"""Six years, eh?",f

19981,"Pray do not let us mention them!""",f
19982,"""But, sir!""",f
19983,"Then the Earl smiled, and his smile was singularly sweet and winning.",f
19984,"""At least, not until after dinner, Warburton!",f
19985,"Instead, you shall tell me how you found me?""",f
19986,"""Mr. Richard directed me where to come, sir.""",f
19987,"""Ah, of course!",f

19989,"The lawyer nearly shuddered at this cheerful, barefaced mention of his lordship's disreputable profession.",f

19991,"Mr. Richard is eager for you to return.""",f
19992,The handsome young face clouded over.,f
19993,My lord shook his head.,f

19998,Warburton ignored the bantering tone and spoke very deliberately.,f
19999,"""At all events, my lord, I believe him anxious to make--amends.""",f

20003,"Amends.""",f
20004,My lord studied his emerald with half-closed eyelids.,f

20006,"""Is not that the word, sir?""",f
20007,"""I confess it strikes me as inapt.",f
20008,"Doubtless I am dull of comprehension.""",f
20009,"""You were not wont to be, my lord.""",f

20011,"But six years changes a man, Warburton.",f

20013,"""I believe so, sir,"" replied the lawyer, frowning at the deft change of subject.",f
20014,"""And Lady Lavinia?""",f
20015,"""Ay.""",f
20016,"Mr. Warburton looked searchingly across at him, seeing which, my lord's eyes danced afresh, brim full with mischief.",f

20019,"""Sir!",f

20022,My lord stiffened in his chair.,f
20023,"He watched the other's jerky movements anxiously, but his voice when he spoke was even and cold.",f
20024,"""Well, sir?""",f
20025,"Mr. Warburton wheeled and came back to the fireplace, looking hungrily down at my lord's impassive countenance.",f
20026,With an effort he seemed to control himself.,f
20027,"""Master Jack, I had better tell you what you have already guessed.",f
20028,"I know.""",f
20029,Up went one haughty eyebrow.,f
20030,"""You know what, Mr. Warburton?""",f
20031,"""That you are innocent!""",f
20032,"""Of what, Mr. Warburton?""",f
20033,"""Of cheating at cards, sir!""",f
20034,"My lord relaxed, and flicked a speck of dust from his great cuff.",f
20035,"""I regret the necessity of having to disillusion you, Mr. Warburton.""",f
20036,"""My lord, do not fence with me, I beg!",f
20037,"You can trust me, surely?""",f
20038,"""Certainly, sir.""",f
20039,"""Then do not keep up this pretence with me; no, nor look so hard neither!",f

20047,"Can you?""",f
20048,My lord sat silent.,f
20049,"With a sigh, Warburton sank on to the settle once more.",f
20050,"He was flushed, and his eyes shone, but he spoke calmly again.",f
20051,"""Of course you cannot.",f
20052,I have never known you lie.,f
20053,You need not fear I shall betray you.,f

20067,"""I feared it!""",f

20073,Warburton made one last effort.,f
20074,"""My lord!"" he cried despairingly, ""Will you not at least think of the disgrace to the name an you be caught?""",f
20075,The shadows vanished from my lord's eyes.,f
20076,"""Mr. Warburton, I protest you are of a morbid turn of mind!",f
20077,"Do you know, I had not thought of so unpleasant a contingency?",f
20078,"I swear I was not born to be hanged!""",f
20079,"The lawyer would have said more, had not the entrance of a servant, carrying a loaded tray, put an end to all private conversation.",f
20080,"The man placed dishes upon the table, lighted candles, and arranged two chairs.",f
20081,"""Dinner is served, sir,"" he said.",f
20082,"My lord nodded, and made a slight gesture toward the windows.",f
20083,Instantly the man went over to them and drew the heavy curtains across.,f
20084,My lord turned to Mr. Warburton.,f
20085,"""What say you, sir?",f
20086,"Shall it be burgundy or claret, or do you prefer sack?""",f
20087,Warburton decided in favour of claret.,f
20088,"""Claret, Jim,"" ordered Carstares, and rose to his feet.",f
20089,"""I trust the drive has whetted your appetite, Warburton, for honest Chadber will be monstrous hurt an you do not justice to his capons.""",f
20090,"""I shall endeavour to spare his feelings,"" replied the lawyer with a twinkle, and seated himself at the table.",f
20091,"Whatever might be Mr. Chadber's failings, he possessed an excellent cook.",f
20092,"Mr. Warburton dined very well, beginning on a fat duck, and continuing through the many courses that constituted the meal.",f
20093,"When the table was cleared, the servant gone, and the port before them, he endeavoured to guide the conversation back into the previous channels.",f
20094,"But he reckoned without my lord, and presently found himself discussing the Pretender's late rebellion.",f
20095,He sat up suddenly.,f
20096,"""There were rumours that you were with the Prince, sir.""",f
20097,Carstares set down his glass in genuine amazement.,f
20098,"""I?""",f
20099,"""Indeed, yes.",f
20100,"I do not know whence the rumour came, but it reached Wyncham.",f
20101,"My lord said nought, but I think Mr. Richard hardly credited it.""",f
20102,"""I should hope not!",f
20103,"Why should they think me turned rebel, pray?""",f
20104,Mr. Warburton frowned.,f
20105,"""Rebel, sir?""",f
20106,"""Rebel, Mr. Warburton.",f
20107,"I have served under his Majesty.""",f
20108,"""The Carstares were ever Tories, Master Jack, true to their rightful king.""",f
20109,"""My dear Warburton, I owe nought to the Stuart princes.",f
20110,"I was born in King George the First's reign, and I protest I am a good Whig.""",f
20111,Warburton shook his head disapprovingly.,f
20112,"""There has never been a Whig in the Wyncham family, sir.""",f
20113,"""And you hope there never will be again, eh?",f
20114,What of Dick?,f
20115,"Is he faithful to the Pretender?""",f
20116,"""I think Mr. Richard does not interest himself in politics, sir.""",f
20117,"Carstares raised his eyebrows, and there fell a silence.",f
20118,After a minute or two Mr. Warburton cleared his throat.,f
20119,"""I--I suppose, sir--you have no idea of--er--discontinuing your--er--profession?""",f

20129,Warburton blushed.,f

20131,"""I shall have to disappoint you, I perceive.",f

20141,"I rob for amusement's sake.""",f
20142,Warburton looked steadily across at him.,f
20143,"""I am surprised, my lord, that you, a Carstares, should find it--amusing.""",f
20144,"John was silent for a moment, and when he at length spoke it was defiantly and with a bitterness most unusual in him.",f
20145,"""The world, Mr. Warburton, has not treated me so kindly that I should feel any qualms of conscience.",f
20146,"But, an it gives you any satisfaction to know it, I will tell you that my robberies are few and far between.",f

20148,"I think you need not fear to hear of that.""",f
20149,"""I--It gives me great satisfaction, my lord, I confess,"" stammered the lawyer, and found nothing more to say.",f
20150,"After a long pause he again produced the bulky roll of parchment and laid it down before the Earl with the apologetic murmur of:  ""Business, my lord!""",f
20151,Carstares descended from the clouds and eyed the packet with evident distaste.,f
20152,He proceeded to fill his and his companion's glass very leisurely.,f
20153,"That done, he heaved a lugubrious sigh, caught Mr. Warburton's eye, laughed in answer to its quizzical gleam, and broke the seal.",f

20157,"Whenever he had tried to turn the conversation that way he had been gently but firmly led into safer channels, and somehow had found it impossible to get back.",f
20158,"My lord was the gayest and most charming of companions, but talk ""business"" he would not.",f
20159,"He regaled the lawyer with spicy anecdotes and tales of abroad, but never once allowed Mr. Warburton to speak of his home or of his brother.",f
20160,"The lawyer retired to rest in a measure reassured by the other's good spirits, but at the same time dispirited by his failure to induce Carstares to return to Wyncham.",f
20161,"Next morning, although he was not up until twelve, he was before my lord, who only appeared in time for lunch, which was served as before in the oak parlour.",f
20162,He entered the room in his usual leisurely yet decided fashion and made Mr. Warburton a marvellous leg.,f
20163,"Then he bore him off to inspect his mare, Jenny, of whom he was inordinately proud.",f
20164,"By the time they returned to the parlour luncheon was served, and Mr. Warburton realised that he had scarcely any time left in which to plead his cause.",f
20165,"My lord's servant hovered continually about the room, waiting on them, until his master bade him go to attend to the lawyer's valise.",f
20166,"When the door had closed on his retreating form, Carstares leaned back in his chair, and, with a rather dreary little smile, turned to his companion.",f

20176,"""I wish I might do more for you, Master Jack!"" stammered Warburton, made miserable by the wistful note in his favourite's voice.",f
20177,"There was no time for more; the coach already awaited him, and his valise had been hoisted up.",f
20178,"As they stood together in the porch, he could only grip my lord's hand tightly and say good-bye.",f
20179,"Then he got hurriedly into the coach, and the door was slammed behind him.",f

20279,"I have cultivated a superb voice, a trifle thick and beery, a little loud, perhaps--ah, something to dream of o' nights!",f
20280,"I doubt they do, too,"" he added reflectively, and affixed the patch at the corner of his mouth.",f
20281,"""So?",f
20282,"A little low, you think?",f
20283,"But 'twill suffice--What's toward?""",f
20284,"Down below in the street there was a great stirring and bustling: horses' hoofs, shouts from the ostlers, and the sound of wheels on the cobble-stones.",f
20285,"Jim went to the window and looked down, craning his neck to see over the balcony.",f
20286,"""'Tis a coach arrived, sir.""",f

20288,"""Yes, sir.",f

20290,He was shaken with laughter.,f
20291,"""What now?""",f
20292,"""'Tis the curiousest sight, sir!",f
20293,"Two gentlemen, one fat and t'other small!",f

20303,"Even as he put the question, understanding flashed into Jim's eyes.",f
20304,"""I rather think that I have had the honour of meeting these gentlemen,"" replied my lord placidly.",f
20305,"""My buckle, Jim....",f
20306,"Is't a prodigious great coach with wheels picked out in yellow?""",f
20307,"""Ay, your honour.",f
20308,"The gentlemen seem a bit put out, too.""",f
20309,"""That is quite probable.",f
20310,"Does the smaller gentleman wear somewhat--ah--muddied garments?""",f
20311,"""I can't see, sir; he stands behind the fat gentleman.""",f
20312,"""Mr. Bumble Bee....",f
20313,"Jim!""",f
20314,"""Sir!""",f
20315,Jim turned quickly at the sound of the sharp voice.,f
20316,"He found that my lord had risen, and was holding up a waistcoat of pea-green pattern on a bilious yellow ground, between a disgusted finger and thumb.",f
20317,Before his severe frown Jim dropped his eyes and stood looking for all the world like a schoolboy detected in some crime.,f
20318,"""You put this--this monstrosity--out for _me_ to wear?"" in awful tones.",f
20319,Jim eyed the waistcoat gloomily and nodded.,f

20321,"""Did I not specify cream ground?""",f
20322,"""Yes, sir.",f
20323,"I thought--I thought that 'twas cream!""",f
20324,"""My good friend, it is--it is--I cannot say what it is.",f
20325,"And pea-green!"" he shuddered.",f
20326,"""Remove it.""",f
20327,Jim hurried forward and disposed of the offending garment.,f
20328,"""And bring me the broidered satin.",f
20329,"Yes, that is it.",f
20330,"It is particularly pleasing to the eye.""",f
20331,"""Yes, sir,"" agreed the abashed Jim.",f
20332,"""You are excused this time,"" added my lord, with a twinkle in his eye.",f
20333,"""What are our two friends doing?""",f
20334,"Salter went back to the window  ""They've gone into the house, sir.",f

20339,"Thanks.""",f
20340,"With no little difficulty, my lord managed to enter into the fine satin garment, which, when on, seemed moulded to his back, so excellently did it fit.",f
20341,He shook out his ruffles and slipped the emerald ring on to his finger with a slight frown.,f
20342,"""I believe I shall remain here some few days,"" he remarked presently.",f
20343,"""To--ah--allay suspicion.""",f
20344,"He looked across at his man as he spoke, through his lashes.",f
20345,"It was not in Jim's nature to inquire into his master's affairs, much less to be surprised at anything he might do or say.",f
20346,"He was content to receive and promptly execute his orders, and to worship Carstares with a dog-like devotion, following blindly in his wake, happy as long as he might serve him.",f
20347,"Carstares had found him in France, very down upon his luck, having been discharged from the service of his late master owing to the penniless condition of that gentleman's pocket.",f
20348,"He had engaged him as his own personal servant, and the man had remained with him ever since, proving an invaluable acquisition to my Lord John.",f
20349,"Despite a singularly wooden countenance, he was by no means a fool, and he had helped Carstares out of more than one tight corner during his inglorious and foolhardy career as highwayman.",f
20350,"He probably understood his somewhat erratic master better than anyone else, and he now divined what was in his mind.",f
20351,He returned that glance with a significant wink.,f
20352,"""'Twas them gentlemen ye held up to-day, sir?"" he asked, jerking an expressive thumb towards the window.",f
20353,"""M'm.",f
20354,Mr. Bumble Bee and friend.,f
20355,It would almost appear so.,f
20356,I think I do not fully appreciate Mr. Bumble Bee.,f
20357,I find his conduct rather tiresome.,f
20358,But it is just possible that he thinks the same of me.,f
20359,"I will further my acquaintance with him.""",f
20360,"Jim grunted scornfully, and an inquiring eye was cocked at him.",f
20361,"""You do not admire our friend?",f
20362,"Pray, do not judge him by his exterior.",f
20363,He may possess a beautiful mind.,f
20364,But I do not think so.,f
20365,"N-no, I really do not think so.""",f
20366,He chuckled a little.,f
20367,"""Do you know, Jim, I believe I am going to enjoy myself to-night!""",f
20368,"""I don't doubt it, your honour.",f
20369,"'Twere child's play to trick the fat gentleman.""",f
20370,"""Probably.",f
20371,But it is not with the fat gentleman that I shall have to deal.,f
20372,"'Tis with all the officials of this charming town, an I mistake not.",f
20373,"Do I hear the small spider returning?""",f
20374,Salter stepped back to the window.,f
20375,"""Ay, sir--with three others.""",f
20376,"""Pre-cisely.",f
20377,Be so good as to hand me my snuff-box.,f
20378,And my cane.,f
20379,Thank you.,f
20380,I feel the time has now come for me to put in an appearance.,f
20381,"Pray, bear in mind that I am new come from France and journey by easy stages to London.",f
20382,And cultivate a stupid expression.,f
20383,"Yes, that will do excellently.""",f
20384,"Jim grinned delightedly; he had assumed no expression of stupidity, and was consequently much pleased with this pleasantry.",f
20385,"He swung open the door with an air, and watched ""Sir Anthony"" mince along the passage to the stairs.",f
20386,"In the coffee-room the city merchant, Mr. Fudby by name, was relating the story of his wrongs, with many an impressive pause, and much emphasis, to the mayor, town-clerk, and beadle of Lewes.",f
20387,"All three had been fetched by Mr. Chilter, his clerk, in obedience to his orders, for the bigger the audience the better pleased was Mr. Fudby.",f
20388,"He was now enjoying himself quite considerably, despite the loss of his precious cash-box.",f
20389,"So was not Mr. Hedges, the mayor.",f
20390,"He was a fussy little man who suffered from dyspepsia; he was not interested in the affair, and he did not see what was to be done for Mr. Fudby.",f
20391,"Further, he had been haled from his dinner, and he was hungry; and, above all, he found Mr. Fudby very unattractive.",f
20392,"Still, a highroad robbery was serious matter enough, and some course of action must be thought out; so he listened to the story with an assumption of interest, looking exceedingly wise, and, at the proper moments, uttering sounds betokening concern.",f
20393,"The more he saw and heard of Mr. Fudby, the less he liked him.",f
20394,Neither did the town-clerk care for him.,f
20395,"There was that about Mr. Fudby that did not endear him to his fellow-men, especially when they chanced to be his inferiors in the social scale.",f
20396,The beadle did not think much about anything.,f
20397,"Having decided (and rightly) that the affair had nothing whatever to do with him, he leaned back in his chair and stared stolidly up at the ceiling.",f
20398,The tale Mr. Fudby was telling bore surprisingly little resemblance to the truth.,f
20399,"It was a much embellished version, in which he himself had behaved with quite remarkable gallantry.",f
20400,It had been gradually concocted during the journey to Lewes.,f
20401,He was still holding forth when my lord entered the room.,f
20402,"Carstares raised his glass languidly to survey the assembled company, bowed slightly, and walked over to the fire.",f
20403,He seated himself in an armchair and took no further notice of anybody.,f
20404,Mr. Hedges had recognised at a glance that here was some _grand seigneur_ and wished that Mr. Fudby would not speak in so loud a voice.,f
20405,"But that individual, delighted at having a new auditor, continued his tale with much relish and in a still louder tone.",f
20406,My lord yawned delicately and took a pinch of snuff.,f
20407,"""Yes, yes,"" fussed Mr. Hedges.",f
20408,"""But, short of sending to London for the Runners, I do not see what I can do.",f
20409,"If I send to London, it must, of course, be at your expense, sir.""",f
20410,Mr. Fudby bristled.,f

20413,I am surprised!,f
20414,"I repeat--I am surprised!""",f
20415,"""Indeed, sir?",f
20416,"I can order the town-crier out, describing the horse, and--er--offering a reward for the capture of any man on such an animal.",f
20417,"But--"" he shrugged and looked across at the town-clerk--""I do not imagine that 'twould be of much use--eh, Mr. Brand?""",f
20418,The clerk pursed his lips and spread out his hands.,f
20419,"""I fear not;",f
20420,I very much fear not.,f
20421,"I would advise Mr. Fudby to have a proclamation posted up round the country.""",f
20422,"He sat back with the air of one who has contributed his share to the work, and does not intend to offer any more help.",f
20423,"""Ho!"" growled Mr. Fudby.",f
20424,He blew out his cheeks.,f
20425,"""'Twill be a grievous expense, though I suppose it must be done, and I cannot but feel that if it had not been for your deplorably cowardly conduct, Chilter--yes, cowardly conduct, I say--I might never have been robbed of my two hundred!""",f
20426,"He snuffled a little, and eyed the flushed but silent Chilter with mingled reproach and scorn.",f
20427,"""However, my coachman assures me he could swear to the horse again, although he cannot remember much about the man himself.",f
20428,Chilter!,f
20429,"How did he describe the horse?""",f
20430,"""Oh--er--chestnut, Mr. Fudby--chestnut, with a half-moon of white on its forehead, and one white foreleg.""",f
20431,Jack perceived that it was time he took a hand in the game.,f
20432,He half turned in his chair and levelled his quizzing-glass at Mr. Chilter.,f
20433,"""I beg your pardon?"" he drawled.",f
20434,Mr. Fudby's eye brightened.,f
20435,The fine gentleman was roused to an expression of interest at last.,f
20436,He launched forth into his story once more for my lord's benefit.,f
20437,"Carstares eyed him coldly, seeing which, Mr. Hedges came hurriedly to the rescue.",f

20439,"Your pardon, sir, I have not the honour of knowing your name?""",f
20440,"""Ferndale,"" supplied Jack, ""Sir Anthony Ferndale.""",f

20443,"""No--quite so--The fact is, these--er--gentlemen have had the--er--misfortune to be waylaid on their journey here.""",f
20444,Sir Anthony's glass was again levelled at the group.,f
20445,His expression betokened mild surprise.,f

20447,"""Dear, dear!""",f
20448,"""Oh, no, no, no, sir!",f
20449,"Not all--Only Mr.--er--""  ""Fudby,"" said that worthy, and discovered that Sir Anthony was bowing frigidly.",f
20450,"At once he rose, and resting his knuckles on the table before him, bent his body slowly and painfully.",f
20451,Sir Anthony inclined his head.,f
20452,"Whereupon, to the delight of all the rest, Mr. Fudby bowed again with even greater stateliness than before.",f
20453,Mr. Hedges observed Sir Anthony's lips to twitch convulsively.,f
20454,"He waited for Mr. Fudby to subside, and then continued:  ""Yes--Mr. Fudby and Mr.--""  ""My clerk!"" snapped Fudby.",f
20455,"Sir Anthony favoured Mr. Chilter with his peculiarly sweet smile, and turned again to Mr. Hedges.",f
20456,"""I see.",f
20457,"A _daylight_ robbery, you say?""",f
20458,"""Broad daylight!"" boomed Mr. Fudby.",f
20459,"""Er--yes, yes,"" interposed the mayor, fearing a fresh outbreak from that quarter.",f
20460,"""I wonder if you have seen anything of such an animal as Mr.--er--Chilter--described?""",f
20461,"""'Tis a most extraordinary thing,"" said Carstares slowly, ""but I have just bought such an one.""",f

20467,"""She has not been in my possession over two hours.",f
20468,"I bought her from an out-at-elbows ruffian, on my way hither.",f
20469,"I thought at one time that 'twas strange that the man should possess such a mare--pure bred, I vow--and wondered why he was so eager to be rid of her.""",f
20470,"""He was eager because he knew he would be recognised by her,"" explained Mr. Fudby kindly.",f
20471,"""Without doubt.",f
20472,Perhaps you would like to see her?,f
20473,"I will send my man--""  ""Oh no, no!"" cried the mayor.",f
20474,"""We would not dream of so inconveniencing you--""  ""'Twere a pleasure,"" bowed Jack, devoutly hoping that Mr. Fudby would not require to see Jenny, who, he felt sure, would betray him by her very evident affection.",f
20475,"""No, no, Sir Anthony, 'tis quite unnecessary, I assure you, but I thank you for all that.",f
20476,"Mr. Fudby, if you would describe the man himself, I will see to the proclamation.""",f

20488,"""You could not see his face, I suppose?""",f
20489,Mr. Chilter hesitated.,f
20490,"""I could see his mouth and chin,"" he said, ""and I remarked a long scar running from his under-lip to the--er--bottom of his face.""",f
20491,Involuntarily Carstares' hand caressed his perfectly smooth chin.,f
20492,"Either the little clerk was a born romancer, or for some reason or other he did not want the highwayman to be taken.",f

20497,Rather anxiously Mr. Chilter reiterated this statement.,f

20501,"'Tis a most ill-favoured rogue in all.""",f
20502,"""It would appear so, Sir Anthony,"" remarked the mayor drily.",f
20503,"He did not in the least believe the story of the squint, and imagined that the fine court gentleman was amusing himself at their expense.",f
20504,"Nevertheless, he had no intention of remonstrating; the sooner he could withdraw from this very tiresome affair the better.",f
20505,"So he gravely took down all the absurd particulars, remarked that the man should be easy to find, and made ready to depart.",f
20506,"The town-clerk rose, and tapped the beadle on the shoulder, whereupon that worthy, with a grunt, abandoned his pose of masterly inactivity and followed the mayor out of the room.",f
20507,Mr. Fudby rose.,f

20581,"In the other direction, the velvet lawns stretched away till they met the orchards and the quiet meadowland.",f
20582,"On two sides the house had its terraces, very white in the sunshine, with stone steps leading down to a miniature lake where water-lilies grew, and where the tiny fish darted to and fro unconcernedly.",f
20583,"Flagged walks there were, running between flower beds a riot of colour, and solemn old trees that had stood there through all the years.",f

20588,"The air was heavy with their united perfumes, while, wafted from a bed below, came the smoky scent of lavender.",f
20589,"The old house seemed half asleep, basking in the sunlight.",f
20590,"Save for a peacock preening its feathers on the terrace steps, there was no sign of life....",f
20591,The old place had harboured generations of Carstares.,f
20592,"Earl had succeeded Earl and reigned supreme, and it was only now that there was no Earl living there.",f
20593,No one knew where he was.,f
20594,"Scarce a month ago one died, but the eldest son was not there to take his place.",f
20595,"For six years he had been absent, and none dared breathe his name, for he disgraced that name, and the old Earl cast him off and forbade all mention of him.",f
20596,But the poor folk of the countryside remembered him.,f
20597,They would tell one another tales of his reckless courage; his sweet smile and his winning ways; his light-heartedness and his never-failing kindness and good-humour.,f
20598,What a rider he was!,f
20599,To see him sit his horse!,f
20600,What a swordsman!,f
20601,Do ye mind the time he fought young Mr. Welsh over yonder in the spinney with half the countryside watching?,f
20602,"Ah, he was a one, was Master Jack!",f
20603,"Do ye mind how he knocked the sword clean out o' Mr. Welsh's hand, and then stood waiting for him to pick it up?",f
20604,"And do ye mind the way his eyes sparkled, and how he laughed, just for the sheer joy o' living?",f
20605,"Endless anecdotes would they tell, and the old gaffers would shake their heads and sigh, and long for the sight of him again.",f
20606,And they would jerk their thumbs towards the Manor and shrug their old shoulders significantly.,f
20607,Who wanted Mr. Richard for squire?,f
20608,"Not they, at least.",f
20609,"They knew he was a good squire and a kindly man, but give them Master John, who would laugh and crack a joke and never wear the glum looks that Mr. Richard affected.",f
20610,"In the house, Richard Carstares paced to and fro in his library, every now and again pausing to glance wretchedly up at the portrait of his brother hanging over his desk.",f
20611,"The artist had managed to catch the expression of those blue eyes, and they smiled down at Richard in just the way that John was always wont to smile--so gaily, and withal so wistfully.",f
20612,"Richard was twenty-nine, but already he looked twice his age.",f
20613,"He was very thin, and there were deep lines on his good-looking countenance.",f
20614,"His grey eyes bore a haunted, care-worn look, and his mouth, though well-shaped, was curiously lacking in determination.",f
20615,"He was dressed soberly, and without that touch of smartness that had characterised him six years ago.",f
20616,"He wore black in memory of his father, and it may have been that severity, only relieved by the lace at his throat, that made his face appear so prematurely aged.",f
20617,"There was none of his brother's boyishness about him; even his smile seemed forced and tired, and his laughter rarely held merriment.",f
20618,"He pulled out his chronometer, comparing it with the clock on the mantelpiece.",f
20619,"His pacing took him to the door, and almost nervously he pulled it open, listening.",f
20620,No sound came to his ears.,f
20621,"Back again, to and fro across the room, eagerly awaiting the clanging of a bell.",f
20622,"It did not come, but presently a footfall sounded on the passage without, and someone knocked at the door.",f
20623,"In two strides Richard was by it, and had flung it wide.",f
20624,Warburton stood there.,f
20625,Richard caught his hand.,f
20626,"""Warburton!",f
20627,At last!,f
20628,"I have been waiting this hour and more!""",f
20629,"Mr. Warburton disengaged himself, bowing.",f
20630,"""I regret I was not able to come before, sir,"" he said primly.",f
20631,"""I make no doubt you travelled back as quickly as possible--come in, sir.""",f
20632,He led the lawyer into the room and shut the door.,f
20633,"""Sit down, Warburton--sit down.",f
20634,"You--you found my brother?""",f
20635,Again Warburton bowed.,f
20636,"""I had the felicity of seeing his lordship, sir.""",f
20637,"""He was well?",f
20638,In good spirits?,f
20639,You thought him changed--yes?,f
20640,"Aged perhaps, or--""  ""His lordship was not greatly changed, sir.""",f
20641,Richard almost stamped in his impatience.,f
20642,"""Come, Warburton, come!",f
20643,Tell me everything.,f
20644,What did he say?,f
20645,Will he take the revenues?,f
20646,"Will he--""  ""His lordship, sir, was reluctant to take anything, but upon maturer consideration, he--ah--consented to accept his elder son's portion.",f
20647,"The revenues of the estate he begs you will make use of.""",f
20648,"""Ah!",f
20649,"But you told him that I would touch nought belonging to him?""",f
20650,"""I tried to persuade his lordship, sir.",f
20651,To no avail.,f
20652,"He desires you to use Wyncham as you will.""",f
20653,"""I'll not touch his money!""",f
20654,Warburton gave the faintest of shrugs.,f
20655,"""That is as you please, sir.""",f
20656,"Something in the suave voice made Richard, from his stand by the desk, glance sharply down at the lawyer.",f
20657,Suspicion flashed into his eyes.,f
20658,"He seemed about to speak, when Warburton continued:  ""I believe I may set your mind at rest on one score, Mr. Carstares: his lordship's situation is tolerably comfortable.",f
20659,"He has ample means.""",f
20660,"""But--but he lives by--robbery!""",f
20661,Warburton's thin lips curled a little.,f
20662,"""Does he not?"" persisted Carstares.",f
20663,"""So he would have us believe, sir.""",f
20664,"""'Tis true!",f
20665,"He--waylaid me!""",f
20666,"""And robbed you, sir?""",f
20667,"""Rob me?",f
20668,"He could not rob his own brother, Warburton!""",f
20669,"""Your pardon, Mr. Carstares--you are right: his lordship could not rob a brother.",f
20670,"Yet have I known a man do such a thing.""",f
20671,For a long minute there was no word spoken.,f
20672,The suspicion that had dwelt latent in Carstares' eyes sprang up again.,f
20673,"Some of the colour drained from his cheeks, and twice he passed his tongue between his lips.",f
20674,"The fingers of his hand, gripping a chair-back, opened and shut spasmodically.",f
20675,"Rather feverishly his eyes searched the lawyer's face, questioning.",f
20676,"""John told you--told you--"" he started, and floundered hopelessly.",f
20677,"""His lordship told me nothing, sir.",f
20678,He was singularly reticent.,f
20679,"But there was nothing he could tell me that I did not already know.""",f
20680,"""What do you mean, Warburton?",f
20681,Why do you look at me like that?,f
20682,Why do you fence with me?,f
20683,"In plain words, what do you mean?""",f
20684,"Warburton rose, clenching his hands.",f
20685,"""I know you, Master Richard, for what you are!""",f
20686,"""Ah!""",f
20687,Carstares flung out his hand as if to ward off a blow.,f
20688,Another tense silence.,f
20689,"With a great effort Warburton controlled himself, and once more the mask of impassivity seemed to descend upon him.",f
20690,After that one tortured cry Richard became calm again.,f
20691,"He sat down; on his face a look almost of relief, coming after a great strain.",f
20692,"""You learnt the truth ... from John.",f
20693,"He ... will expose me?""",f
20694,"""No, sir.",f
20695,I have not learnt it from him.,f
20696,"And he will never expose you.""",f
20697,Richard turned his head.,f
20698,"His eyes, filled now with a species of dull pain, looked full into Warburton's.",f
20699,"""Oh?"" he said.",f
20700,"""Then you...?""",f
20701,"""Nor I, sir.",f
20702,I have pledged my word to his lordship.,f
20703,"I would not speak all these years for your father's sake--now it is for his.""",f
20704,He choked.,f
20705,"""You ... are fond of John?""",f
20706,"Still the apathetic, weary voice.",f
20707,"""Fond of him--?",f
20708,"Good God, Master Dick, I love him!""",f
20709,"""And I,"" said Richard, very low.",f
20710,"He received no reply, and looked up.",f
20711,"""You don't believe me?""",f
20712,"""Once, sir, I was certain of it.",f
20713,"Now--!"" he shrugged.",f
20714,"""Yet 'tis true, Warburton.",f
20715,"I would give all in my power to undo that night's work.""",f
20716,"""You cannot expect me to believe that, sir.",f
20717,It rests with you alone whether his name be cleared or not.,f
20718,"And you remain silent.""",f
20719,"""Warburton, I--Oh, do you think it means nothing to me that John is outcast?""",f
20720,Before the misery in those grey eyes some of Warburton's severity fell away from him.,f
20721,"""Master Richard, I want to think the best I can of you.",f
20722,Master Jack would tell me nothing.,f
20723,"Will you not--can you not explain how it came that you allowed him to bear the blame of your cheat?""",f
20724,Richard shuddered.,f
20725,"""There's no explanation--no excuse.",f
20726,I forced it on him!,f
20727,"On Jack, my brother!",f
20728,"Because I was mad for love of Lavinia--Oh, my God, the thought of it is driving me crazed!",f
20729,I thought I could forget; and then--and then--I met him!,f
20730,The sight of him brought it all back to me.,f
20731,Ever since that day I have not known how to live and not shriek the truth to everyone!,f
20732,And I never shall!,f
20733,"I never shall!""",f
20734,"""Tell me, sir,"" pleaded Warburton, touched in spite of himself.",f
20735,Richard's head sunk into his hands.,f
20736,"""The whole scene is a nightmare....",f
20737,I think I must have been mad....,f
20738,I scarce knew what I was about.,f
20739,"I--""  ""Gently, sir.",f
20740,Remember I know hardly anything.,f
20741,"What induced you to mark the cards?""",f
20742,"""That debt to Gundry.",f
20743,My father would not meet it;,f
20744,I had to find the money.,f
20745,I could not face the scandal--I tell you I was mad for Lavinia!,f
20746,I could think of nought else.,f
20747,I ceased to care for John because I thought him in love with her.,f
20748,I could not bear to think of the disgrace which would take her from me....,f
20749,Then that night at Dare's.,f
20750,I was losing;,f
20751,I knew I could not pay.,f
20752,"Gad! but I can see my notes of hand under Milward's elbow, growing... growing.",f
20753,"""Jack had played Milward before me, and he had won.",f
20754,"I remember they laughed at him, saying his luck had turned at last--for he always lost at cards.",f
20755,Milward and I played with the same pack that they had used....,f
20756,"There was another table, I think.",f
20757,Dare was dicing with Fitzgerald; someone was playing faro with Jack behind me.,f
20758,I heard Jack say his luck was out again--I heard them laugh....,f
20759,And all the time I was losing ... losing.,f
20760,"""The pin of my cravat fell out on to my knee.",f
20761,I think no one saw it.,f
20762,"As I picked it up the thought that I should mark the cards seemed to flash into my mind--oh, it was despicable, I know!",f
20763,I held the ace of clubs in my hand: I scratched it with that pin--in one corner.,f
20764,It was easily done.,f
20765,"By degrees I marked all four, and three of the kings.",f
20766,"""No one noticed, but I was nervous--I dared do no more.",f
20767,I replaced that pin.,f
20768,Soon I began to win--not very much.,f
20769,Then Tracy Belmanoir came across the room to watch our play.,f
20770,From that moment everything seemed to go awry.,f
20771,It was the beginning of the trouble.,f
20772,"""Tracy stood behind me watching....",f
20773,"I could feel him there, like some black moth, hovering....",f
20774,I don't know how long he stayed like that--it seemed hours.,f
20775,I could feel his eyes....,f
20776,I could have shrieked--I'll swear my hands were trembling.,f
20777,"""Suddenly he moved.",f
20778,I had played the ace of hearts.,f
20779,"He said: 'One moment!' in that soft, sinister voice of his.",f
20780,"""Milward was surprised.",f
20781,I tried to tell myself that Devil had noticed nothing....,f
20782,The mark on that card was so faint that I could scarce see it myself.,f
20783,"I thought it impossible that he, a mere onlooker, should discover it.",f
20784,He stepped forward.,f
20785,I remember he brushed my shoulder.,f
20786,I remember how the light caught the diamonds he was wearing.,f
20787,I think my brain was numbed.,f
20788,I could only repeat to myself: 'Extravagant Devil!,f
20789,Extravagant Devil!' and stare at those winking jewels.,f
20790,"Then I thought: 'He is Lavinia's brother, but I do not like him;",f
20791,I do not like him...' --little foolish things like that--and my throat was dry--parched.,f
20792,"""He bent over the table ... stretched out his white, white hand ... turned over the ace ... lifted his quizzing glass ... and stared down at the card.",f
20793,Then he dropped the glass and drew out his snuff-box....,f
20794,It had Aphrodite enamelled on the lid.,f
20795,I remember it so distinctly....,f
20796,I heard Tracy ask Milward to examine the ace.,f
20797,I wanted to spring up and strangle him....,f
20798,"I could scarce keep my hands still.""",f
20799,Richard paused.,f
20800,"He drew his hand across his eyes, shuddering.",f
20801,"""Milward saw the scratch.",f
20802,He cried out that the cards were marked!,f
20803,Suddenly everyone seemed to be gathered about our table--all talking!,f
20804,Jack had his hand on my shoulder; he and Dare were running through the pack.,f
20805,But all the while I could look at no one but Tracy--Andover.,f
20806,"He seemed so sinister, so threatening, in those black clothes of his.",f
20807,His eyes were almost shut--his face so white.,f
20808,And he was looking at me!,f
20809,He seemed to be reading my very soul....,f
20810,For an instant I thought he knew!,f
20811,I wanted to shout out that he was wrong!,f
20812,I wanted to shriek to him to take his eyes away!,f
20813,"Heaven knows what I should have done!... but he looked away--at Jack, with that sneering smile on his damned mask of a face!",f
20814,I could have killed him for that smile!,f
20815,"I think Jack understood it--he dropped the cards, staring at Tracy.",f
20816,"""Everyone was watching them ... no one looked at me.",f
20817,"If they had they must surely have learnt the truth; but they were hanging on Andover's lips, looking from him to Jack and back again....",f
20818,I remember Fitzgerald dropped his handkerchief--I was absurdly interested in that.,f
20819,"I was wondering why he did not pick it up, when Andover spoke again....",f
20820,'And Carstares' luck turned...?',f
20821,"Like that, Warburton!",f
20822,"With just that faint, questioning in his voice.",f
20823,"""Before Jack could speak there was an outcry.",f
20824,Dare cried 'Shame!' to Andover.,f
20825,"They laughed at him, as well they might.",f
20826,But I saw them exchange glances--they were wondering....,f
20827,It was suspicious that Jack should have had that run of luck--and that he should lose as soon as he left that table.,f
20828,"""Milward--poor, silly Milward--gaped at Tracy and stuttered that surely 'twas another pack we had used.",f
20829,I could hardly breathe!,f
20830,Then Andover corrected him--How did he _know_?,f
20831,"No one else remembered, or thought of noticing--only he!",f
20832,"""I can see Jack now, standing there so stiffly, with his head thrown up, and those blue eyes of his flashing.",f
20833,"""'Do I understand you to accuse me, Belmanoir?' he said.",f
20834,"Oh, but he was furious!",f
20835,"""Tracy never said a word.",f
20836,Only his eyes just flickered to my face and away again.,f
20837,"""Jack's hand was gripping my shoulder hard.",f
20838,I could feel his anger....,f
20839,Dare called out that the suggestion was preposterous.,f
20840,That John should cheat!,f
20841,"""Tracy asked him if the cards were his.",f
20842,Gad!,f
20843,"I can hear his soft, mocking voice now!",f
20844,"""Dare went purple--you know his way, Warburton.",f
20845,"""'Opened in your presence on this table!' he cried.",f
20846,"""'By Carstares!' smiled Tracy.",f
20847,"""It was true.",f
20848,"But why should Tracy remember it, and none other?",f
20849,"They stared at him, amazed.",f
20850,Dare turned to Jack for corroboration.,f
20851,He nodded.,f
20852,I think he never looked haughtier....,f
20853,"""You know how fond of Jack Dare was?",f
20854,He tried to bluster it off--tried to get control over the affair.,f
20855,It was to no avail.,f
20856,"We were puppets, worked by that devil, Belmanoir!",f
20857,One man managing that ghastly scene....,f
20858,"He pointed out that only three of us had used that pack: Jack, Milward and I.  ""Jack laughed.",f
20859,"""'Next you will accuse Dick!' he snapped scornfully.",f
20860,"""'One of you, certainly,' smiled Andover.",f
20861,'Or Milward.',f
20862,"""Then everyone realised that one of us three must have marked the cards.",f
20863,"Milward was upset, but no one suspected him.",f
20864,It was Jack--or me.,f
20865,"""As long as I live I shall never forget the horror of those moments.",f
20866,If I were exposed it meant the end of everything between Lavinia and me.,f
20867,"I tell you, Warburton, I would have committed any sin at that moment!",f
20868,Nothing would have been too black--I could not bear to lose her.,f
20869,"You don't know what she meant to me!""",f
20870,"""I can guess, sir,"" said the lawyer, gravely.",f
20871,"""No, no!",f
20872,No one could imagine the depths of my love for her!,f
20873,I think not even Jack....,f
20874,I felt his hand leave my shoulder....,f
20875,The truth had dawned on him.,f
20876,I heard the way the breath hissed between his teeth as he realised....,f
20877,"Somehow I got to my feet, clutching at the table, facing him.",f
20878,I don't excuse myself--I know my conduct was beyond words dastardly.,f
20879,"I looked across at him--just said his name, as though I could scarce believe my ears.",f
20880,So all those watching thought.,f
20881,But Jack knew better.,f
20882,He knew I was imploring him to save me.,f
20883,He understood all that I was trying to convey to him.,f
20884,For an instant he stared at me.,f
20885,"I thought--I thought--God forgive me, I prayed that he might take the blame on himself.",f
20886,Then he smiled.,f
20887,"Coward though I was, when I saw that hurt, wistful little smile on his lips, I nearly blurted out the whole truth.",f
20888,Not quite....,f
20889,I suppose I was too mean-spirited for that.,f
20890,"""Jack bowed to the room and again to Dare.",f
20891,"He said: 'I owe you an apology, sir.'",f
20892,"""Dare sprang forward, catching him by the shoulder--crying out that it could not be true!",f
20893,When Jack laughed--he fell away from him as from the plague.,f
20894,And all of them!,f
20895,"My God, to see them drawing away--not looking at Jack!",f
20896,And Jack's face--growing paler and harder ... every moment....,f
20897,All his friends... turning their backs to him.,f
20898,Davenant--even Jim Davenant walked away to the fireplace with Evans.,f
20899,"""I could not look at Jack.",f
20900,I dared not.,f
20901,I could not go to him--stand by him!,f
20902,I had not the right.,f
20903,I had to leave him there--in the middle of the room--alone.,f
20904,The awful hurt in his eyes made me writhe.,f
20905,"The room was whirling round--I felt sick--I know I fell back into my chair, hiding my face.",f
20906,I hardly cared whether they suspected me or not.,f
20907,But they did not.,f
20908,"They knew how great was the love between us, and they were not surprised that I broke down.",f
20909,"""I heard Andover's soft voice ... he was telling some tale to Dare.",f
20910,"Oh, they were well-bred those men!",f
20911,They skimmed over the unpleasant little episode--ignored Jack!,f
20912,"""Jack spoke again.",f
20913,I could guess how bravely he was keeping a proud front.,f
20914,"I know word for word what he said: 'Mr. Dare, your Grace, Gentlemen--my apologies for being the cause of so unpleasant an incident.",f
20915,Pray give me leave.',f
20916,"""They paid no heed.",f
20917,I heard him walk to the door--heard him open it.,f
20918,I could not look at him.,f
20919,He--he paused ... and said just one word: 'Dick!' quite softly.,f
20920,Heaven knows how I got to him!,f
20921,I know I overturned my chair.,f
20922,That drew Dare's attention.,f
20923,"He said: 'You are not going, Dick?'",f
20924,"I shouted 'Yes,' at him, and then Jack took my arm, leading me out.",f
20925,"""And--and all he said was: 'Poor old Dick!'...",f
20926,He--he had no word of blame for me.,f
20927,He would not allow me to go back and tell the truth--as I would have done.,f
20928,"Ay, Warburton, when Jack called me to him, I could have cried it aloud--but--he would not have it....",f
20929,"He said: 'For Lavinia's sake.'...""",f
20930,Warburton blew his nose violently.,f
20931,His fingers were trembling.,f
20932,"""You know what happened afterwards.",f
20933,You know how my father turned Jack out penniless--you know how his friends shunned him--you know my poor mother's grief.,f
20934,And you know that he went away--that we could not find him when--my mother died....,f
20935,His last words to me--were: 'Make Lavinia-happy--and try to forget--all this.',f
20936,Forget it!,f
20937,Heavens!,f
20938,"Try as I might, I could hear nothing further of him until two months ago, when he--waylaid me.",f
20939,Then I was half-dazed at the suddenness of it.,f
20940,He--he grasped my hand--and--laughed!,f
20941,"It was so dark, I could scarce see him.",f
20942,"I only had time to demand his address, and then--he was off--galloping away over the heath.",f
20943,"I think--even then--he bore no malice.""",f
20944,"""He does not now!"" said Warburton sharply.",f
20945,"""But, Master Dick, if all this is true, why do you not even now clear him?",f

20993,"After a moment he sat down, staring blankly out of the window, his hands loosely clasped on the desk before him.",f
20994,"So he remained for a long while, immobile.",f
20995,"At last, with the faintest of sighs, he moved and picked up a quill.",f
20996,"He dipped it in the ink, and, with his other hand, drew towards him a sheaf of papers.",f
20997,Presently he was writing steadily.,f
20998,"For perhaps twenty minutes the quill travelled to and fro across the pages; then it paused, and Richard looked up towards the door.",f
20999,It opened to admit Lady Lavinia.,f
21000,She came rustling into the room with her embroidery in her hand.,f
21001,"She dropped her husband a mock curtsey and went over to a high-backed armchair, stretching out a dimpled hand to draw it forward.",f
21002,"But even as her fingers touched it she had changed her mind, and fluttered over to the couch, there to seat herself with much swirling of brocades and arrangement of skirts.",f
21003,"She then proceeded to occupy herself with her work, plying her needle hurriedly and jerkily.",f
21004,"Richard watched her in silence, following each turn of the pretty hand and each movement of her fair head.",f
21005,"The silence was evidently not to my lady's taste, for she presently began to beat an impatient tattoo on the floor with one slender foot.",f
21006,"Still he said nothing, and she raised her pure china-blue eyes to his face.",f
21007,"""Why so glum, Dick?",f
21008,"Why do you not talk to me?""",f
21009,"Her voice was rather high-pitched and childish, and she had a curious way of ending each sentence with an upward lilt and a long drawn-out accent, very fascinating to listen to.",f

21011,"""Am I, my dear?",f
21012,I crave your pardon.,f
21013,"Warburton has just been.""",f
21014,"Her face clouded over instantly, and the full-lipped mouth drooped petulantly.",f
21015,"""He has seen him.""",f
21016,"""Oh?""",f
21017,"She made the word twice its length, and filled it with disinterest.",f
21018,"""Yes.",f
21019,Jack will have none of it.,f
21020,He asks me to be his steward and to use Wyncham as I will.,f
21021,"He is very generous.""",f
21022,"""Yes, oh yes.",f
21023,"And you will, Richard?""",f
21024,He ignored the question.,f
21025,"""He--Warburton--says he is not much changed.""",f
21026,"""Oh?""",f
21027,"Again the long-drawn monosyllable, accompanied by a tiny yawn.",f
21028,"""He says he does not think--Jack--bears me ill-will--"" He paused, as if expecting her to speak, but she was absorbed in arranging two flowers--culled from a bowl at her side--at her breast, and took no notice.",f
21029,Carstares turned his head away wearily.,f
21030,"""If it were not for you, my dear, I would tell the truth.",f
21031,"I believe I shall go crazed an I do not.""",f
21032,"""Dick!"" ...",f

21042,"""No,"" he said slowly, not looking at her.",f
21043,"""No, I cannot promise that.""",f
21044,"She sprang to her feet, flinging her broidery from her carelessly, and waved fierce, agitated little hands.",f
21045,"""That means you will do it.",f

21049,"""Calm yourself!""",f
21050,"He knew she was about to fly into one of her sudden passions, and frowned with acute vexation.",f
21051,"""I will not!",f
21052,"Oh yes, yes!",f
21053,You think me a shrew!,f
21054,I know!,f
21055,I know!,f

21057,"No, I will not hush.",f
21058,"I am a horrid woman, yes, but you are a cheat--a cheat--a cheat!""",f
21059,Carstares strode over to her.,f
21060,"""Lavinia!""",f
21061,"""No--no!",f
21062,Leave me alone!,f
21063,You make me miserable!,f
21064,"You refuse me everything that I want most, and then you threaten to disgrace me--""  ""That is untrue!"" cried Richard, goaded into replying.",f
21065,"""I will not promise, that is all.",f
21066,What have I refused you that was within my means to give you?,f

21074,"""No--I am unreasonable!",f
21075,"I know it, but don't _tell_ me so, for I cannot bear it!",f
21076,"And don't look reproach at me, Richard!",f
21077,"You drive me mad, I tell you!""",f
21078,"She was sweeping up and down the room like some caged animal, lashing herself to a worse fury.",f

21085,"Yes, yes, but what are you?",f
21086,"Oh, why did you tell me you cheated _after_ you had wedded me?""",f
21087,Angry sobs escaped her; her handkerchief was in shreds upon the floor.,f
21088,"Carstares turned his back to her, that she might not see how she had contrived to hurt him, and the movement drove her to fresh fury.",f
21089,"""Don't do that!",f
21090,Don't!,f
21091,Don't!,f
21092,You make me worse by your dreadful silence!,f

21096,"Don't you?""",f
21097,He gripped her by the shoulders and swung her to face him.,f

21100,"""Oh, yes, yes!",f

21102,She twined her arms about his neck and shrank closer.,f

21654,"Shall I not miss him, Tracy?""",f
21655,Richard suddenly remembered his brother-in-law's presence.,f
21656,He turned and went to the foot of the stairs.,f
21657,"""So you are determined to wrest my wife from me?"" he smiled.",f
21658,"Tracy descended leisurely, opening his snuff-box.",f
21659,"""Yes, I require a hostess,"" he said.",f
21660,"""And I have""--he paused--""induced her to honour Andover with her presence.",f
21661,"Shall we have the felicity of seeing you at any time?""",f
21662,"""I thank you, no. I am not, you will understand, in the mood for the gaiety for which my poor Lavinia craves.""",f
21663,"The Duke bowed slightly, and they all three went out on to the terrace, Lavinia laughing and talking as Richard had not heard her laugh or talk for days.",f
21664,"She was the life and soul of the little dinner-party, flirting prettily with her husband and exerting herself to please him in every way.",f
21665,"She had won her point; therefore she was in excellent spirits with all the world, and not even the spilling of some wine on her new silk served to discompose her.",f
21666,"CHAPTER VI  BATH: 29 QUEEN SQUARE   The autumn and the winter passed smoothly, and April found the Carstares installed at Bath, whither Lady Lavinia had teased her husband into going, despite his desire to return to Wyncham and John.",f
21667,"She herself did not care to be with the child, and was perfectly content that Richard should journey occasionally to Wyncham to see that all was well with him.",f
21668,"On the whole, she had enjoyed the winter, for she had induced Richard to open Wyncham House, Mayfair, the Earl's town residence, where she had been able to hold several entirely successful routs, and many select little card-parties.",f
21669,"Admirers she had a-many, and nothing so pleased her vain little heart as masculine adulation.",f
21670,"Carstares never entered his home without stumbling against some fresh flame of hers, but as they mostly consisted of what he rudely termed the lap-dog type, he was conscious of no jealous qualms, and patiently submitted to their inundation of his house.",f
21671,"He was satisfied that Lavinia was happy, and, as he assured himself at times when he was most tried, nothing else signified.",f
21672,The only flaw to Lavinia's content was the need of money.,f
21673,"Not that she was stinted, or ever refused anything that he could in reason give her; but her wants were never reasonable.",f
21674,"She would demand a new town chariot, upholstered in pale blue, not because her own was worn or shabby, but because she was tired of its crimson cushions.",f
21675,"Or she would suddenly take a fancy to some new, and usually fabulously expensive toy, and having acquired it, weary of it in a week.",f
21676,"Without a murmur, Richard gave her lap-dogs (of the real kind), black pages, jewels, and innumerable kickshaws, for which she rewarded him with her brightest smiles and tenderest caresses.",f
21677,"But when she required him to refurnish Wyncham House in the style of the French Court, throwing away all the present Queen Anne furniture, the tapestries, and the countless old trappings that were one and all so beautiful and so valuable, he put his foot down with a firmness that surprised her.",f
21678,Not for any whim of hers was Jack's house to be spoiled.,f
21679,"Neither her coaxing nor her tears had any effect upon Richard, and when she reverted to sulks, he scolded her so harshly that she was frightened, and in consequence silenced.",f
21680,"For a week she thought and dreamt of nothing but gilded French chairs, and then abruptly, as all else, the fancy left her, and she forgot all about it.",f
21681,"Her mantua-maker's bills were enormous, and caused Richard many a sleepless night, but she was always so charmingly penitent that he could not find it in his heart to be angry; and, after all, he reflected, he would rather have his money squandered on her adornment than on that of her brothers.",f
21682,"She was by turns passionate and cold to him: one day enrapturing him by some pretty blandishment, the next snapping peevishly when he spoke to her.",f
21683,"At the beginning of the season he dutifully conducted her to routs and _bals masques_, but soon she began to go always with either Andrew or Robert, both of whom were in town, and whose casual chaperonage she much preferred to Richard's solicitous care.",f
21684,"Tracy was rarely in London for more than a few days at a time, and the Carstares, greatly to Richard's relief, saw but little of him.",f
21685,"Carstares disliked Colonel Lord Robert Belmanoir, but the Duke he detested, not only for his habitual sneer towards him, but for the influence that he undoubtedly held over Lavinia.",f
21686,"Richard was intensely jealous of this, and could sometimes hardly bring himself to be civil when his Grace visited my lady.",f
21687,"Whether justly or not, he inwardly blamed Tracy for all Lavinia's crazy whims and periodical fits of ill-temper.",f
21688,"It did not take his astute Grace long to discover this, and with amused devilry he played upon it, encouraging Lavinia in her extravagance, and making a point of calling on her whenever he was in town.",f
21689,Carstares never knew when not to expect to find him there; he came and went to and from London with no warning whatsoever.,f
21690,"No one ever knew where he was for more than a day at a time, and no one was in the least surprised if he happened to be seen in London when he should, according to all accounts, have been in Paris.",f
21691,"They merely shrugged their shoulders, and exchanged glances, murmuring: ""Devil Belmanoir!"" and wondering what fresh intrigue he was in.",f
21692,So altogether Richard was not sorry when my lady grew suddenly sick of town and was seized with a longing for Bath.,f
21693,"He had secretly hoped that she might return to Wyncham, but when she expressed no such wish, he stifled his own longing for home, shut up the London house, and took her and all her baggage to Bath, installing her in Queen Square in one of the most elegantly furnished houses in the place.",f
21694,"Lady Lavinia was at first charmed to be there again; delighted with the house, and transported over the excellencies of the new French milliner she had discovered.",f
21695,"But the milliner's bills proved monstrous, and the drawing-room of her house not large enough for the routs she contemplated giving.",f
21696,"The air was too relaxing for her, and she was subject to constant attacks of the vapours that were as distressing to her household as they were to herself.",f
21697,"The late hours made her head ache as it never ached in London, and the damp gave her a cold.",f
21698,"Furthermore, the advent of an attractive and exceedingly wealthy little widow caused her many a bitter hour, to the considerable detriment of her good-temper.",f
21699,"She was lying on a couch in her white and gilt drawing room one afternoon--alas! the craze for French furniture was o'er-smelling-bottle in hand and a _bona fide_ ache in her head, when the door opened and Tracy walked into the room.",f
21700,"""Good heavens!"" she said faintly, and uncorked her salts.",f
21701,"It was his Grace's first appearance since she had come to Bath, and the fact that he had politely declined an invitation that she had sent to him still rankled in her mind.",f
21702,"He bowed over the limp hand that she extended, and looked her up and down.",f
21703,"""I regret to find you thus indisposed, my dear sister,"" he said smoothly.",f
21704,"""'Tis nought.",f
21705,Only one of my stupid headaches.,f
21706,"I am never well here, and this house is stuffy,"" she answered fretfully.",f
21707,"""You should take the waters,"" he said, scrutinising, through his eyeglass, the chair to which she had waved him.",f
21708,"""It has an unstable appearance, my dear;",f
21709,"I believe I prefer the couch.""",f
21710,He moved to a smaller sofa and sat down.,f
21711,"""Pray, how long have you been in Bath?"" she demanded.",f
21712,"""I arrived last Tuesday week.""",f
21713,Lady Lavinia started up.,f
21714,"""Last Tuesday week?",f
21715,"Then you have been here ten days and not visited me until now!""",f
21716,He appeared to be examining the whiteness of his hands through the folds of black lace that drooped over them.,f
21717,"""I believe I had other things to do,"" he said coolly.",f
21718,A book of sermons that she had been trying to peruse slid to the ground as Lavinia jerked a cushion into place.,f
21719,"""And you come to me when it suits you?",f
21720,"How could you be so unkind as to refuse my invitation?""",f
21721,"There was a rising, querulous note in her voice which gave warning of anger.",f
21722,"""My dear Lavinia, if you exhibit your deplorable temper to me, I shall leave you, so have a care.",f
21723,"I thought you would understand that your good husband's society, improving though it may be, would be altogether too oppressive for my taste.",f
21724,"In fact, I was surprised at your letter.""",f
21725,"""You might have come for my sake,"" she answered peevishly, sinking back again.",f
21726,"""I suppose you have been dancing attendance on the Molesly woman?",f
21727,"Lud! but I think you men have gone crazed.""",f
21728,"Understanding came to his Grace, and he smiled provokingly.",f
21729,"""Is that what upsets you?",f
21730,"I wondered.""",f
21731,"""No, 'tis not!"" she flashed.",f
21732,"""And I do not see why you should think so!",f
21733,"For my part, I cannot see that she is even tolerable, and the way the men rave about her is disgusting!",f
21734,Disgusting!,f
21735,But 'tis always the same when a woman is unattached and wealthy.,f
21736,Well!,f
21737,Well!,f
21738,Why do you not say something?,f
21739,"Do you find her so lovely?""",f
21740,"""To tell the truth, my dear, I have barely set eyes on the lady.",f
21741,"I have been otherwise engaged, and I have done with all women, for the time, save one.""",f
21742,"""So I have heard you say before.",f
21743,Do you contemplate marriage?,f
21744,"Lud! but I pity the girl.""",f
21745,"She gave a jeering little laugh, but it was evident that she was interested.",f
21746,His Grace was not in the least degree ruffled.,f
21747,"""I do not contemplate marriage, Lavinia, so your sympathies are wasted.",f
21748,"I have met a girl--a mere child, for sure--and I will not rest until I have her.""",f
21749,"""Lord!",f
21750,"Another farmer's chit?""",f
21751,"""No, my dear sister, not another farmer's chit.",f
21752,"A lady.""",f
21753,"""God help her!",f
21754,Who is she?,f
21755,"Where does she live?""",f
21756,"""She lives in Sussex.",f
21757,"Her name I shall not tell you.""",f
21758,"Her ladyship kicked an offending cushion on to the floor, and snapped at him.",f
21759,"""Oh, as you please!",f
21760,"I shall not die of curiosity!""",f
21761,"""Ah!""",f
21762,"The cynical lips curled annoyingly, and Lady Lavinia was seized with a mad desire to hurl her smelling-bottle at him.",f
21763,"But she knew that it was worse than useless to be angry with Tracy, so she yawned ostentatiously, and hoped that she irritated him.",f
21764,"If she did, she got no satisfaction from it, for he continued, quite imperturbably:  ""She is the daintiest piece ever a man saw, and I'll swear there's blood and fire beneath the ice!""",f
21765,"""Is it possible the girl will have none of your Grace?"" wondered Lavinia in mock amazement, and had the pleasure of seeing him frown.",f
21766,"The thin brows met over his arched nose, and the eyes glinted a little, while she caught a glimpse of cruel white teeth closing on a sensual under-lip.",f
21767,"She watched his hand clench on his snuff-box, and exulted silently at having roused him.",f
21768,"It was a very brief joy, however, for the next moment the frown had disappeared, the hand unclenched, and he was smiling again.",f
21769,"""At present she is cold,"" he admitted, ""but I hope that in time she will become more plastic.",f
21770,"I think, Lavinia, I have some experience with your charming, if capricious sex.""",f
21771,"""I don't doubt you have.",f

21954,CHAPTER VII  INTRODUCING SUNDRY NEW CHARACTERS   Not twenty minutes' walk from Lady Lavinia's house in Queen Square resided a certain Madam Thompson--a widow--who had lived in Bath for nearly fifteen years.,f
21955,"With her was staying Miss Elizabeth Beauleigh and her niece, Diana.",f
21956,"Madam Thompson had been at a seminary with Miss Elizabeth when both were girls, and they had ever afterwards kept up their friendship, occasionally visiting one another, but more often contenting themselves with the writing of lengthy epistles, full of unimportant scraps of news and much gossip, amusing only on Miss Elizabeth's side, and on the widow's uninteresting and rambling.",f
21957,"It was a great joy to Madam Thompson when she received a letter from Miss Beauleigh begging that she and her niece might be allowed to pay a visit to her house in Bath, and to stay at least three weeks.",f
21958,"The good lady was delighted at having her standing invitation at last accepted, and straightway wrote back a glad assent.",f
21959,"She prepared her very best bedchamber for Miss Beauleigh, who, she understood, was coming to Bath principally for a change of air and scene after a long and rather trying illness.",f
21960,"In due course the two ladies arrived, the elder very small and thin, and birdlike in her movements; the younger moderately tall, and graceful as a willow tree, with great candid brown eyes that looked fearlessly out on to the world, and a tragic mouth that belied a usually cheerful disposition, and hinted at a tendency to look on the gloomy side of life.",f
21961,"Madam Thompson, whose first meeting with Diana this was, remarked on the sad mouth to Miss Elizabeth, or Betty as she was more often called, as they sat over the fire on the first night, Diana herself having retired to her room.",f
21962,Miss Betty shook her head darkly and prophesied that her precious Di would one day love some man as no man in _her_ opinion deserved to be loved!,f
21963,"""And she'll have love badly,"" she said, clicking her knitting-needles energetically.",f
21964,"""_I_ know these temperamental children!""",f
21965,"""She looks so melancholy,"" ventured the widow.",f
21966,"""Well there you are wrong!"" replied Miss Betty.",f
21967,"""'Tis the sunniest-tempered child, and the sweetest-natured in the whole wide world, bless her!",f
21968,But I don't deny that she can be miserable.,f
21969,Far from it.,f
21970,"Why, I've known her weep her pretty eyes out over a dead puppy even!",f
21971,"But usually she is gay enough.""",f
21972,"""I fear this house will be dull and stupid for her,"" said Madam Thompson regretfully.",f
21973,"""If only my dear son George were at home to entertain her--""  ""My love, pray do not put yourself out!",f
21974,"I assure you Diana will not at all object to a little quiet after the life she has been leading in town this winter with her friend's family.""",f
21975,"Whatever Diana thought of the quiet, she at least made no complaint, and adapted herself to her surroundings quite contentedly.",f
21976,"In the morning they would all walk as far as the Assembly Rooms, and Miss Betty would drink the waters in the old Pump Room, pacing sedately up and down with her friend on one side and her niece on the other.",f
21977,"Madam Thompson had very few acquaintances in Bath, and the people she did know were all of her own age and habits, rarely venturing as far as the crowded fashionable quarter; so Diana had to be content with the society of the two old ladies, who gossiped happily enough together, but whose conversation she could not but find singularly uninteresting.",f
21978,"She watched the _monde_ with concealed wistfulness, seeing Beau Nash strut about among the ladies, bowing with his extreme gallantry, always impeccably garbed, and in spite of his rapidly increasing age and bulk still absolute monarch of Bath.",f
21979,"She saw fine painted madams in enormous hoops, and with their hair so extravagantly curled and powdered that it appeared quite grotesque, mincing along with their various cavaliers; elderly beaux with coats padded to hid their shrunken shoulders, and paint to fill the wrinkles on their faces; young rakes; stout dowagers with their demure daughters; old ladies who had come to Bath for their health's sake; titled folk of fashion, and plain gentry from the country--all parading before her eyes.",f
21980,"One or two young bucks tried to ogle her, and received such indignant glances from those clear eyes, that they never dared annoy her again, but for the most part no one paid any heed to the unknown and plainly clad girl.",f
21981,Then came his Grace of Andover upon the stage.,f
21982,He drew Diana's attention from the first moment that he entered the Pump Room--a black moth amongst the gaily-hued butterflies.,f
21983,He had swept a comprehensive glance round the scene and at once perceived Diana.,f
21984,"Somehow, exactly how she could never afterwards remember, he had introduced himself to her aunt and won that lady's good will by his smoothness of manner and polished air.",f
21985,"Madam Thompson, who, left to herself, never visited the Assembly Rooms, could not be expected to recognise Devil Belmanoir in the simple Mr. Everard who presented himself.",f
21986,"As he had told his sister, Diana was cold.",f
21987,"There was something about his Grace that repelled her, even while his mesmeric personality fascinated.",f
21988,"He was right when he said that she feared him; she was nervous, and the element of fear gave birth to curiosity.",f
21989,"She was intrigued, and began to look forward to his daily appearance in the Pump Room with mingled excitement and apprehension.",f
21990,"She liked his flattering attention, and his grand air.",f
21991,"Often she would watch him stroll across the floor, bowing to right and left with that touch of insolence that characterised him, and rejoiced in the knowledge that he was coming straight to her, and that the painted beauties who so palpably ogled and invited him to their sides could not alter his course.",f
21992,"She felt her power with a thrill of delight, and smiled upon Mr. Everard, giving him her hand to kiss, and graciously permitting him to sit with her beside her aunt.",f
21993,"He would point out all the celebrities of town and Bath for her edification, recalling carefully chosen and still more carefully censured anecdotes of each one.",f
21994,"She discovered that Mr. Everard was an entertaining and harmless enough companion, and even expanded a little, allowing him a glimpse of her whimsical nature with its laughter and its hint of tears.",f
21995,"His Grace of Andover saw enough to guess at the unsounded depths in her soul, and he became lover-like.",f
21996,"Diana recoiled instinctively, throwing up a barrier of reserve between them.",f
21997,"It was not what he said that alarmed her, but it was the way in which he said it, and the vague something in the purring, faintly sinister voice that she could not quite define, that made her heart beat unpleasantly fast, and the blood rush to her temples.",f
21998,"She began first to dread the morning promenade, and then to avoid it.",f
21999,"One day she had a headache; the next her foot was sore; another time she wanted to work at her fancy stitchery, until her aunt, who knew how she disliked her needle, and how singularly free from headaches and all petty ailments she was wont to be, openly taxed her with no longer wishing to walk abroad.",f
22000,"They were in the girl's bedroom at the time, Diana seated before her dressing-table, brushing out her hair for the night.",f
22001,"When her aunt put the abrupt question she hesitated, caught a long strand in her comb, and pretended to be absorbed in its disentanglement.",f
22002,"The clouds of rippling hair half hid her face, but Miss Betty observed how her fingers trembled, and repeated her question.",f
22003,Then came the confession.,f
22004,Mr. Everard was unbearable; his attentions were odious; his continued presence revolting to Mistress Di.,f
22005,"She was afraid of him, afraid of his dreadful green eyes and of his soft voice.",f
22006,"She wished they had never come to Bath, and still more that they had not met him.",f
22007,"He looked at her as if--as if--oh, in short, he was hateful!",f
22008,Miss Betty was horrified.,f
22009,"""You cannot mean it!",f
22010,"Dear, dear, dear!",f
22011,"Here was I thinking what a pleasant gentleman he was, and all the time he was persecuting my poor Di, the wretch!",f
22012,"_I_ know the type, my love, and I feel inclined to give him a good piece of my mind!""",f
22013,"""Oh, no--no!"" implored Diana.",f
22014,"""Indeed, you must do no such thing, Auntie!",f
22015,"He has said nought that I could possibly be offended at--'tis but his _manner_, and the--and the way he looked at me.",f
22016,"Indeed, indeed, you must not!""",f
22017,"""Tut, child!",f
22018,Of course I shall say nought.,f
22019,But it makes me so monstrous angry to think of my poor lamb being tormented by such as he that I declare I could tear his eyes out!,f
22020,"Yes, my dear, I could!",f
22021,"Thank goodness we are leaving Bath next week!""",f
22022,"""Yes,"" sighed Diana.",f
22023,"""I cannot help being glad, though Madam Thompson is very amiable!",f
22024,"'Tis so very different when there is no man with one!""",f
22025,"""You are quite right, my love.",f
22026,"We should have insisted on your father's staying with us instead of allowing him to fly back to his fusty, musty old volumes.",f
22027,"I shall not be so foolish another time, I can assure you.",f
22028,"But we need not go to the Assembly Rooms again.""",f
22029,"""I need not go,"" corrected Diana gently.",f
22030,"""Of course you and Madam Thompson will continue to.""",f
22031,"""To tell the truth, my love,"" confessed Miss Betty, ""I shall not be sorry for an excuse to stay away.",f
22032,"'Tis doubtless most ill-natured of me, but I cannot but think that Hester has altered sadly since last I saw her.",f
22033,"She is always talking of sermons and good works!""",f
22034,"Diana twisted her luxuriant hair into a long plait, and gave a gurgling little laugh.",f
22035,"""Oh, Auntie, is it not depressing?",f
22036,I wondered how you could tolerate it!,f
22037,"She is so vastly solemn, poor dear thing!""",f
22038,"""Well,"" said Miss Betty charitably, ""she has seen trouble, has Hester Thompson, and I have my doubts about this George of hers.",f
22039,"A worthless young man, I fear, from all accounts.",f
22040,"But, unkind though it may be, I shall be glad to find myself at home again, and that's the truth!""",f
22041,She rose and picked up her candle.,f
22042,"""In fact, I find Bath not half so amusing as I was told 'twould be.""",f
22043,Diana walked with her to the door.,f
22044,"""'Tis not amusing at all when one has no friends; but last year, when my cousins were with us and papa took a house for the season on the North Parade, 'twas most enjoyable.",f
22045,"I wish you had been there, instead of with that disagreeable Aunt Jennifer!""",f
22046,She kissed her relative most affectionately and lighted her across the landing to her room.,f
22047,"Then she returned to her room and shut the door, giving a tired little yawn.",f
22048,"It was at about that moment that his Grace of Andover was ushered into the already crowded card-room of my Lord Avon's house in Catharine Place, and was greeted with ribald cries of ""Oho, Belmanoir!"", and ""Where's the lady, Devil?""",f
22049,"He walked coolly forward into the full light of a great pendant chandelier, standing directly beneath it, the diamond order on his breast burning and winking like a living thing.",f
22050,"The diamonds in his cravat and on his fingers glittered every time he moved, until he seemed to be carelessly powdered with iridescent gems.",f
22051,"As usual, he was clad in black, but it would have been difficult to find any other dress in the room more sumptuous or more magnificent than his sable satin with its heavy silver lacing, and shimmering waistcoat.",f
22052,"Silver lace adorned his throat and fell in deep ruffles over his hands, and in defiance of Fashion, which decreed that black alone should be worn to tie the hair, he displayed long silver ribands, very striking against his unpowdered head.",f
22053,He raised his quizzing glass and looked round the room with an air of surprised hauteur.,f
22054,"Lord Avon, leaning back in his chair at one of the tables, shook a reproving finger at him.",f
22055,"""Belmanoir, Belmanoir, we have seen her and we protest she is too charming for you!""",f
22056,"""In truth, we think we should be allowed a share in the lady'th thmileth,"" lisped one from behind him, and his Grace turned to face dainty, effeminate little Viscount Fotheringham, who stood at his elbow, resplendent in salmon-pink satin and primrose velvet, with skirts so full and stiffly whaleboned that they stood out from his person, and heels so high that instead of walking he could only mince.",f
22057,Tracy made a low leg.,f
22058,"""Surely shall you have a share in her smiles an she wills it so,"" he purred, and a general laugh went up which caused the fop to flush to the ears, as he speedily effaced himself.",f
22059,"He had been one of those who had tried to accost Diana, and gossip-loving Will Stapely, with him at the time, had related the story of his discomfiture to at least half-a-dozen men, who immediately told it to others, vastly amused at the pertinacious Viscount's rebuff.",f
22060,"""What was it Selwyn said?"" drawled Sir Gregory Markham, shuffling cards at Lord Avon's table.",f
22061,Davenant looked across at him inquiringly.,f
22062,"""George?",f
22063,Of Belmanoir?,f
22064,"When?""",f
22065,"""Oh, at White's one night--I forget--Jack Cholmondely was there--he would know; and Horry Walpole.",f
22066,"'Twas of Devil and his light o' loves--quite apt, on the whole.""",f
22067,Cholmondely looked up.,f
22068,"""Did I hear my name?""",f
22069,"""Ay.",f
22070,"What was it George said of Belmanoir at White's the night Gilly made that absurd bet with Ffolliott?""",f
22071,"""When Gilly--oh, yes, I remember.",f
22072,"'Twas but an old hexameter tag, playing on his name: '_Est bellum bellis bellum bellare puellis_.'",f
22073,"He seemed to think it a fitting motto for a ducal house.""",f
22074,There was another general laugh at this.,f
22075,"Markham broke in on it:  ""Who is she, Tracy?""",f
22076,His Grace turned.,f
22077,"""Who is who?"" he asked languidly.",f
22078,Lord Avon burst out laughing.,f
22079,"""Oh, come now, Belmanoir, that won't do!",f
22080,It really will not!,f
22081,"Who is she, indeed!""",f
22082,"""Ay, Belmanoir, who is the black-haired beauty, and where did you find her?"" cried Tom Wilding, pressing forward with a glass in one hand and a bottle of port in the other.",f
22083,"""I thought you were captivated by Cynthia Evans?""",f
22084,"Tracy looked bewildered for the moment, and then a light dawned on him.",f
22085,"""Evans!",f
22086,"Ah, yes!",f
22087,"The saucy widow who lived in Kensington, was it not?",f
22088,"I remember.""",f
22089,"""He had forgotten!"" cried Avon, and went off into another of the noisy laughs that had more than once caused Mr. Nash to shudder and to close his august eyes.",f
22090,"""You'll be the death of me, Devil!",f
22091,"Gad! but you will!""",f
22092,"""Oh, I trust not.",f
22093,"Thank you, Wilding.""",f
22094,"He accepted the glass that Tom offered, and sipped delicately.",f
22095,"""But you've not answered!"" reminded Fortescue from another table.",f
22096,He dealt the cards round expertly.,f
22097,"""Is it hands off, perhaps?""",f
22098,"""Certainly,"" replied his Grace.",f
22099,"""It generally is, Frank, as you know.""",f
22100,"""To my cost!"" was the laughing rejoinder, and Fortescue rubbed his sword arm as if in memory of some hurt.",f
22101,"""You pinked me finely, Tracy!""",f
22102,"""Clumsily, Frank, clumsily.",f
22103,"It might have been quicker done.""",f
22104,"The Viscount, who had been a second at the meeting, tittered amiably.",f
22105,"""Neatetht thing I ever thaw, 'pon my honour.",f
22106,"All over in leth than a minute, Avon!",f
22107,"Give you my word!""",f
22108,"""Never knew you had fought Devil, Frank?",f
22109,"What possessed you?""",f
22110,"""I was more mad than usual, I suppose,"" replied Fortescue in his low, rather dreamy voice, ""and I interfered between Tracy and his French singer.",f
22111,"He objected most politely, and we fought it out in Hyde Park.""",f
22112,"""Gad, yes!"" exclaimed his partner, Lord Falmouth.",f
22113,"""Why, I was Devil's second!",f
22114,"But it was ages ago!""",f
22115,"""Two years,"" nodded Fortescue, ""but I have not forgotten, you see!""",f
22116,"""Lord, I had!",f
22117,"And 'twas the funniest fight I ever saw, with you as furious as could be and Devil cool as a cucumber.",f
22118,"You were never much of a swordsman, Frank, but that morning you thrust so wildly that stap me if I didn't think Devil would run you through.",f
22119,"'Stead of that he pinks you neatly through the sword-arm, and damme if you didn't burst out laughing fit to split!",f
22120,"And then we all walked off to breakfast with you, Frank, as jolly as sandboys.",f
22121,"Heavens, yes.",f
22122,"That was a fight!""",f
22123,"""It was amusing,"" admitted Tracy at Fortescue's elbow.",f
22124,"""Don't play, Frank.""",f
22125,Fortescue flung his cards face downwards on the table.,f
22126,"""Curse you, Tracy, you've brought bad luck!"" he said entirely without rancour.",f
22127,"""I had quite tolerable hands before you came.""",f
22128,"""Belmanoir, I will thtake my chestnut mare 'gaintht your new grey,"" lisped the Viscount, coming up to the table, dice-box in hand.",f
22129,"""Stap me, but that is too bad!"" cried Wilding.",f
22130,"""Don't take him, Devil!",f
22131,"Have you seen the brute?""",f
22132,The four players had finished their card-playing and were quite ready for the dice.,f
22133,"""Trust in your luck, Belmanoir, and take him!"" advised Pritchard, who loved hazarding other men's possessions, but kept a tight hold on his own.",f
22134,"""Ay, take him!"" echoed Falmouth.",f
22135,"""Don't,"" said Fortescue.",f
22136,"""Of course I shall take him,"" answered his Grace tranquilly.",f
22137,"""My grey against your chestnut and the best of three.",f
22138,"Will you throw?""",f
22139,The Viscount rattled his box with a flourish.,f
22140,Two threes and a one turned up.,f
22141,"With a hand on Fortescue's shoulder, and one foot on the rung of his chair, Tracy leaned forward and cast his own dice on to the table.",f
22142,He had beaten the Viscount's throw by five.,f
22143,"The next toss Fotheringham won, but the last fell to his Grace.",f
22144,"""Damnathion!"" said the Viscount cheerfully.",f

22146,"""Thunder and turf, Fotheringham!",f

22149,"""Nonthenth!",f
22150,"Do you take me, Belmanoir?""",f
22151,"""Certainly,"" said the Duke, and threw.",f
22152,"""Oh, an you are in a gaming mood, I will play you for the right to try my hand with the dark beauty!"" called Markham across the room.",f
22153,"""Against what?"" asked Fortescue.",f
22154,"""Oh, what he wills!""",f
22155,"The Viscount had cast and lost, and his Grace won the second throw.",f

22161,"""I intend to, my dear fellow.",f
22162,She is not your style.,f
22163,"I begin to wonder whether she altogether suits my palate.""",f
22164,"He drew out his snuff-box and offered it to his host, and the other men finding that he was proof against their railing, allowed the subject to drop.",f
22165,"In the course of the evening his Grace won three thousand guineas--two at ombre and one at dice--lost his coveted grey hunter and won him back again from Wilding, to whom he had fallen.",f
22166,"He came away at three o'clock in company with Fortescue, both perfectly cool-headed, although his Grace, for his part, had imbibed a considerable quantity of burgundy, and more punch than any ordinary man could take without afterwards feeling very much the worse for wear.",f
22167,"As my Lord Avon's door closed behind them, Tracy turned to his friend:  ""Shall we walk, Frank?""",f
22168,"""Since our ways lie together, yes,"" replied Fortescue, linking his arm in the Duke's.",f
22169,"""Down Brock Street and across the Circus is our quickest way.""",f
22170,"They strolled down the road for a few moments in silence, passing a linkman on the way.",f
22171,"Fortescue bade him a cheery good-night, which was answered in a very beery voice, but the Duke said nothing.",f

22275,"""Good-night!""",f

22277,"""I shall see you to-morrow--that is, this morning--at the Baths?""",f
22278,"""Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,"" was the smiling rejoinder.",f
22279,"""Sleep soundly, Frank!""",f
22280,"He waved an ironic farewell and crossed the road to his own lodgings, which stood almost directly opposite.",f
22281,"""And I suppose _you_ will sleep as soundly as if you had not a stain on your conscience--and had not tried your uttermost to alienate the regard of the only friend you possess,"" remarked Frank bitterly to the darkness.",f
22282,"""Damn you, Tracy, for the villain you are!""",f
22283,He walked up the steps to his own front door and turned the key in the lock.,f
22284,He looked over his shoulder as a door slammed across the street.,f

22286,"""Oh, you poor Devil!""",f
22287,CHAPTER VIII  THE BITER BIT   With John Carstares the winter had passed quite uneventfully.,f
22288,"He continued his highway robbery, but he made two bad blunders--not from the point of view of a thief, but from that of the gentleman in him.",f
22289,"The first was when he stopped an opulent-looking chariot, which he found to contain two ladies, their maid and their jewels, and the second when the occupant of a large travelling coach chanced to be an old gentleman who possessed far greater courage than physical strength.",f
22290,"On the first occasion my lord's dismay had been ludicrous, and he had hastily retired after tendering a naive apology.",f
22291,The old gentleman in the second episode had defied him so gallantly that he had impulsively offered him the butt end of one of his pistols.,f
22292,"The old man was so surprised that he allowed the weapon to fall to the ground, where it exploded quite harmlessly, sending up a cloud of dust and smoke.",f
22293,"Carstares then begged his pardon most humbly, assisted him back into his coach, and rode off before the astonished Mr. Dunbar had time to collect his wits.",f
22294,"The robbing was not carried out in a very scientific manner, for, as has been seen, Carstares could not bring himself to terrorise women or old men, and there only remained the young and the middle-aged gentlemen, one of whom Jack offered to fight for the possession of his jewels.",f
22295,"His challenge was promptly accepted by the man, who happened to possess a strong sense of humour, and probably saw a chance of saving his belongings in the offer.",f
22296,"He had been speedily worsted, but Carstares was so pleased with a particularly neat thrust which he had executed, that he forwent half the booty, and the pair of them divided the contents of the jewel-box by the roadside, the sporting gentleman keeping his most valued belongings and giving Jack the surplus.",f
22297,"They parted on the very best of terms, and all Carstares got out of the episode was a little sword practice and a few trinkets.",f
22298,"When day came he was patrolling the west side of Sussex, beyond Midhurst, not because he thought it a profitable part, but because he knew and loved the country.",f
22299,"One late afternoon towards the end of the month he rode gaily into one of the small villages that nestle amongst the Downs, and made his way down the quaint main street to the George Inn, where he drew rein and dismounted.",f
22300,"At his call an aged ostler hobbled out of a side door, chewing an inevitable straw, and after eyeing the newcomer and his steed for an appreciable length of time, evidently decided that they were worthy of his attention, for he came forward, remarking that it had been a pleasant day.",f
22301,"Carstares agreed with him, and volunteered the information that it would be another fine day to-morrow, if the sunset were to be trusted.",f
22302,"To this the ostler replied that he, for one, never trusted to no red sunsets, and added darkly that there warn't nothing so deceitful to his manner o' thinking.",f
22303,"He'd known it be such a red sunset as never was, and yet be a-pouring with rain all next day....",f
22304,Should he take the mare?,f
22305,Carstares shook his head.,f
22306,"""No, I thank you.",f
22307,I remain here but a few moments.,f
22308,"I doubt she's thirsty though--eh, Jenny?""",f
22309,"""Water, sir?""",f
22310,"""For her, yes.",f
22311,For myself I fancy a tankard of your home-brewed ale.,f
22312,"Stand, Jenny!""",f
22313,He turned away and walked up the steps to the inn door.,f
22314,"""Be you a-going to leave her there, sir--a-standing all by herself?"" inquired the man, surprised.",f
22315,"""Why, yes!",f
22316,"She's docile enough.""",f
22317,"""Well!",f
22318,Seems to me a risky thing to leave a hoss--and a skittish hoss at that--a-standing loose in the road.,f
22319,"Ye won't be tying her to a post, master?""",f
22320,Carstares leaned his arms on the balustrade and looked down at them.,f
22321,"""I will not.",f
22322,"She'd be very hurt at such treatment, wouldn't you, lass?""",f
22323,"Jenny tossed her head playfully, as if in agreement, and the ostler scratched his head, looking from her to my lord:  ""A'most seems as if she understands what you be a-saying to her, sir!""",f
22324,"""Of course she understands!",f
22325,Don't I tell you 'tis a clever little lady?,f
22326,"If I call her now she'll come up these steps to me, and not all the ostlers in Christendom could stop her.""",f
22327,"""Don't'ee go for to do it, sir!"" urged the old man, backing.",f
22328,"""She must be uncommon fond o' ye?""",f
22329,"""She'd be a deal fonder of you if you'd fetch her a drink,"" hinted Jack broadly.",f
22330,"""Ay, sir!",f
22331,"I be a-going this werry instant!""",f
22332,"And with many an anxious glance over his shoulder at the perfectly quiet mare, he disappeared through an open doorway into the yard.",f
22333,"When Carstares, tankard of ale in hand, emerged from the inn and sat himself down on one of the benches that stood against the wall, the mare was drinking thirstily from a bucket which the ancient one held for her.",f
22334,"""'Tis a wunnerful fine mare, sir,"" he remarked at length, after a careful inspection of her points.",f
22335,"Carstares nodded pleasantly, and surveyed Jenny through half-shut eyes.",f
22336,"""I think so every time I look at her,"" he said.",f
22337,"""I should think she could get a bit of a pace on her, sir?",f
22338,"Mebbe ye've tried her racing?""",f
22339,"""No, she wasn't brought up to that.",f
22340,"But she's fast enough.""",f
22341,"""Ay, sir.",f
22342,"No vices?""",f
22343,"""Lord, no!""",f
22344,"""Don't kick neither?""",f
22345,"""Not with me.""",f
22346,"""Ah! they allus knows who'll stand it and who won't.""",f
22347,"Jack drained his tankard, and setting it down on the bench beside him, rose to his feet.",f
22348,"""She'd not dream of kicking a friend.",f
22349,"Jenny!""",f
22350,"The ostler watched her pick her way towards her master, coquetting with her head, and sidling round him in the most playful manner possible.",f
22351,A slow smile dawned on the man's face.,f
22352,"""Ah, it be a purty sight to watch her--so it be!"" he said, and received a guinea from Jack, who never tired of listening to praise of his beloved Jenny.",f
22353,"Carstares remounted, nodded farewell to the ostler and rode leisurely on down the street, soon branching off to the right into a typical Sussex lane, where he trotted between uneven hedges, sweet with blossom and with May, and placid fields rolling away on either side, upwards until they merged into the undulating hills, barely discernible in the gloom, that are the downs.",f
22354,"It was a wonderfully calm evening, with only a gentle west wind blowing, and the moon already shining faintly in the dark sky.",f
22355,There was nothing beyond the sound of the mare's hoofs to break the beautiful stillness of it all.,f
22356,"He rode for some way without meeting a soul, and when at the end of an hour someone did chance along the road it was only a labourer returning home to his supper after a long day in the fields.",f
22357,John bade him a cheery good evening and watched him pass on down the road humming.,f
22358,After that he met no one.,f
22359,"He rode easily along for miles, into the fast-gathering darkness.",f
22360,"He was frowning as he rode, thinking.",f
22361,"Curiously enough, it was on his penniless days in France that his mind dwelt this evening.",f
22362,"He had resolutely thrust that dark time behind him, determined to forget it, but there were still days when, try as he might, he could not prevent his thoughts flying back to it.",f
22363,"With clenched teeth he recalled the days when he, the son of an Earl, had taught fencing in Paris for a living....",f
22364,"Suddenly he laughed harshly, and at the unusual sound the mare pricked up her ears and sidled uneasily across the road.",f
22365,"For once no notice was taken of her, and she quickened her pace with a flighty toss of her head....",f
22366,"He thought how he, the extravagant John, had pinched and scraped and saved rather than go under; how he had lived in one of the poorer _quartiers_ of the city, alone, without friends--nameless.",f
22367,"Then, cynically now, he reviewed the time when he had taken to drinking, heavily and systematically, and had succeeded in pulling himself up at the very brink of the pit he saw yawning before him.",f
22368,Next the news of his mother's death....,f
22369,John passed over that quickly.,f
22370,Even now the thought of it had the power of rousing in him all the old misery and impotent resentment.,f
22371,His mind sped on to his Italian days.,f
22372,"On his savings he had travelled to Florence, and from there he went gradually south, picking up all the latest arts and subtleties of fence on the way.",f
22373,The change of scene and of people did much to restore his spirits.,f
22374,His devil-may-care ways peeped out again; he started to gamble on the little money he had left.,f
22375,For once Fortune proved kind; he doubled and trebled and quadrupled the contents of his purse.,f
22376,"Then it was that he met Jim Salter, whom he engaged as his servant.",f
22377,This was the first friend since he had left England.,f
22378,"Together they travelled about Europe, John gambling his way, Jim keeping a relentless hand on the exchequer.",f
22379,"It was entirely owing to his watchfulness and care that John was not ruined, for his luck did not always hold good, and there were days when he lost with distressing steadiness.",f
22380,"But Jim guarded the winnings jealously, and there was always something to fall back on.",f
22381,At last the longing for England and English people grew so acute that John made up his mind to return.,f
22382,But he found that things in England were very different from what they had been abroad.,f
22383,Here he was made to feel acutely that he was outcast.,f
22384,"It was impossible to live in town under an assumed name, as he would like to have done, for too many people knew Jack Carstares, and would remember him.",f
22385,"He saw that he must either live secluded, or--and the idea of becoming a highwayman occurred to him.",f
22386,"A hermit's existence he knew to be totally unsuited to a man of his temperament, but the free, adventurous spirit of the road appealed to him.",f
22387,"The finding of his mare--J. the Third, as he laughingly dubbed her--decided the point; he forthwith took on himself the role of quixotic highwayman, roaming his beloved South Country, happier than he had been since he first left England; bit by bit regaining his youth and spirits, which last, not all the trouble he had been through had succeeded in extinguishing....",f
22388,"Clip-clap, clip-clop....",f
22389,"With a jerk he came back to earth and reined-in his mare, the better to listen.",f
22390,"Along the road came the unmistakable sound of horses' hoofs, and the scrunch-scrunch of swiftly-revolving wheels on the sandy surface.",f
22391,"By now the moon was right out, but owing to the fact that she was playing at hide-and-seek in and out of the clouds, it was fairly dark.",f
22392,"Nevertheless, Jack fastened his mask over his face with quick, deft fingers, and pulled his hat well over his eyes.",f
22393,"His ears told him that the vehicle, whatever it was, was coming towards him, so he drew into the side of the road, and taking a pistol from its holster, sat waiting, his eyes on the bend in the road.",f
22394,"Nearer and nearer came the horses, until the leader swung round the corner.",f
22395,"Carstares saw that it was an ordinary travelling chariot, and levelled his pistol.",f
22396,"""Halt, or I fire!""",f
22397,"He had to repeat the command before it was heard, and to ride out from the shadow of the hedge.",f
22398,The chariot drew up and the coachman leaned over the side to see who it was bidding them to stop in so peremptory a manner.,f
22399,"""What d'ye want?",f
22400,Who are ye?,f
22401,"Is there aught amiss?"" he cried testily, and found himself staring at a long-nosed pistol.",f
22402,"""Throw down your arms!""",f
22403,"""I ain't got none, blast ye!""",f
22404,"""On your honour?""",f
22405,Jack dismounted.,f
22406,"""Ay!",f
22407,"Wish I had, and I'd see ye damned afore I'd throw 'em down!""",f
22408,At this moment the door of the coach opened and a gentleman leapt lightly down on to the road.,f
22409,"He was big and loose-limbed as far as Carstares could see, and carried himself with an easy grace.",f
22410,My lord presented his pistol.,f
22411,"""Stand!"" he ordered gruffly.",f
22412,The moon peeped coyly out from behind a cloud and shed her light upon the little group as if to see what all the fuss was about.,f
22413,"The big man's face was in the shadow, but Jack's pistol was not.",f
22414,"Into its muzzle the gentleman gazed, one hand deep in the pocket of his heavy cloak, the other holding a small pistol.",f
22415,"""Me very dear friend,"" he said in a rich brogue, ""perhaps ye are not aware that that same pistol ye are pointing at me is unloaded?",f
22416,Don't move;,f
22417,"I have ye covered!""",f
22418,"Jack's arm fell to his side, and the pistol he held clattered to the ground.",f
22419,But it was not surprise at Jim's defection that caused him that violent start.,f
22420,It was something far more overwhelming.,f
22421,"For the voice that proceeded from the tall gentleman belonged to one whom, six years ago, he had counted, next to Richard, his greatest friend on earth.",f
22422,"The man moved a little, and the moonlight shone full on his face, clearly outlining the large nose and good-humoured mouth, and above, the sleepy grey eyes.",f
22423,Miles!,f
22424,Miles O'Hara!,f
22425,For once Jack could find nothing amusing in the situation.,f
22426,"It was too inconceivably hideous that he should meet his friend in this guise, and, further, be unable to reveal himself.",f
22427,A great longing to tear off his mask and to grasp Miles' hand assailed him.,f
22428,"With an effort he choked it down and listened to what O'Hara was saying:  ""If ye will be so kind as to give me your word of honour ye'll not be afther trying to escape, I should be greatly obliged.",f
22429,"But I tell ye first that if ye attempt to move, I shall shoot.""",f
22430,Jack made a hopeless gesture with his hand.,f
22431,He felt dazed.,f
22432,The whole thing was ridiculous; how Miles would laugh afterwards.,f
22433,He went cold.,f
22434,"There would be no ""afterwards""....",f
22435,Miles would never know....,f
22436,"He would be given over to the authorities, and Miles would never know that he had helped Jack Carstares to the scaffold....",f
22437,"Perhaps, too, he would not mind so very much, now that he, Jack, was so disgraced.",f
22438,"One could never tell; even if he risked everything now, and told his true identity, Miles might turn away from him in disgust;",f
22439,"Miles, who could never stoop to a dishonourable act.",f
22440,Carstares felt that he would bear anything sooner than face this man's scorn....,f
22441,"""Never tell me 'tis a dumb man ye are, for I heard ye shout meself!",f
22442,"Do ye give me your word of honour, or must I have ye bound?""",f
22443,Carstares pulled himself together and set his teeth as he faced the inevitable.,f
22444,Escape was impossible;,f
22445,"Miles would shoot, he felt sure, and then his disguise would be torn away and his friend would see that Jack Carstares was nothing but a common highwayman.",f
22446,"Whatever happened, that must not be, for the sake of the name and Richard.",f
22447,So he quietly held out his hands.,f
22448,"""Ay, I give my word, but ye can bind me if ye choose.""",f
22449,"It was his highwayman voice: raucous, and totally unlike his own.",f
22450,But O'Hara's eyes were fixed on the slender white hands held out to him.,f
22451,"In his usual haphazard fashion, Jack had quite forgotten to grime his hands.",f
22452,"They were shapely and white, and carefully manicured.",f
22453,Miles took either wrist in his large hands and turned them palm upwards in the moonlight.,f
22454,"""Singularly white hands ye have, for one in your profession,"" he drawled, and tightened his hold as Jack tried to draw them away.",f
22455,"""No, ye do not!",f
22456,"Now be so good as to step within, me friend.""",f
22457,Jack held back an instant.,f
22458,"""My mare?"" he asked, and O'Hara noted the anxiety in his voice.",f
22459,"""Ye need not be after worrying about her,"" he said.",f
22460,"""George!""",f
22461,The footman sprang forward.,f
22462,"""Yessir?""",f
22463,"""Ye see that mare?",f
22464,I want ye to ride her home.,f
22465,"Can ye do it?""",f
22466,"""Yessir!""",f
22467,"""I doubt it,"" murmured Jack.",f
22468,So did Jenny.,f
22469,She refused point blank to allow this stranger to mount her.,f
22470,"Her master had left her in one spot, and there she would stand until he chose to bid her move.",f
22471,In vain did the groom coax and coerce.,f
22472,She ran round him and seemed a transformed creature.,f
22473,"She laid her ears flat and gnashed at the bit, ready to lash out furiously at the first opportunity.",f
22474,Jack watched the man's futile struggles with the ghost of a smile about his lips.,f
22475,"""Jenny!"" he said quietly, and O'Hara looked round at him sharply, frowning.",f
22476,"Unconsciously, he had spoken naturally, and the voice was faintly familiar.",f
22477,Jenny twitched the bridle from the perspiring groom and minced up to the prisoner.,f
22478,"""Would ye allow me to have a hand free--sir?"" he asked.",f
22479,"""Mebbe I can manage her.""",f
22480,"Without a word Miles released him, and he caught the bridle, murmuring something unintelligible to the now quiet animal.",f
22481,"O'Hara watched the beautiful hand stroke her muzzle reassuringly, and frowned again.",f
22482,No ordinary highwayman this.,f
22483,"""Mount her now, will 'ee?""",f
22484,"Jack flung at the groom, and kept a warning hand on the rein as the man obeyed.",f
22485,With a final pat he turned away.,f
22486,"""She'll do now, sir.""",f
22487,O'Hara nodded.,f
22488,"""Ye've trained her well.",f
22489,"Get in, please.""",f
22490,"Jack obeyed, and in a minute or two O'Hara jumped in after him, and the coach began to move forward.",f
22491,"For a while there was silence, Carstares keeping himself well under control.",f
22492,"It was almost unbearable to think that after this brief drive he would never set eyes on his friend again, and he wanted so badly to turn and grasp that strong hand....",f
22493,Miles turned in his seat and tried to see the masked face in the darkness.,f
22494,"""Ye are a gentleman?"" he asked, going straight to the point.",f
22495,Jack was prepared for this.,f
22496,"""Me, sir?",f
22497,"Lor' no, sir!""",f
22498,"""I do not believe ye.",f
22499,"Don't be forgettin' I've seen your hands!""",f
22500,"""Hands, sir?"" in innocent bewilderment.",f
22501,"""Sure, ye don't think I'd be believing ye an ordinary rogue, with hands like that?""",f
22502,"""I don't rightly understand ye, sir?""",f
22503,"""Bejabers then, ye'll be understanding me tomorrow!""",f
22504,"""To-morrow, sir?""",f
22505,"""Certainly.",f
22506,Ye may as well tell me now as then.,f
22507,"I'm not such a daft fool as I look, and I know a gentleman when I see one, even an he does growl at me as you do!"" he chuckled.",f
22508,"""And I'd an odd feeling I knew ye when ye spoke to the mare.",f
22509,"I'd be loth to send a friend to the gallows.""",f
22510,"How well Jack knew that soft, persuasive voice.",f
22511,"His hands clenched as he forced himself to answer:  ""I don't think I've ever seen ye afore, sir.""",f
22512,"""Maybe ye have not.",f
22513,"We shall see to-morrow.""",f
22514,"""What do ye mean by to-morrow, sir?"" ventured Carstares uneasily.",f
22515,"""Sure, ye will have the honour of appearing before me, me friend.""",f
22516,"""Before _you_, sir?""",f
22517,"""Why not?",f
22518,"I'm a Justice of the Peace, heaven save the mark!""",f
22519,"There was a breathless pause, and then at last the funny side of it struck Jack, and his shoulders shook with suppressed laughter.",f
22520,The exquisite irony of it was almost too much for him.,f
22521,"He, the Earl of Wyncham, was to be formally questioned by his friend Sir Miles O'Hara, J.P.!",f
22522,"""What ails ye now, man?",f
22523,"Ye find it amusing?"" asked Miles, surprised.",f
22524,"""Oh, Lud, yes!"" gasped Jack, and collapsed into his corner.",f
22525,"CHAPTER IX  LADY O'HARA INTERVENES   Lady O'Hara found that her big, indolent husband was unusually silent next morning at breakfast.",f
22526,"She had not been married long enough to consent to being practically ignored, no matter what the time of day, but she had been married quite long enough to know that before she took any direct action against him, she must first allow him to assuage his appetite.",f
22527,"Accordingly she plied him with coffee and eggs, and with a satisfied and slightly motherly air, watched him attack a sirloin of beef.",f
22528,"She was a pretty, birdlike little lady, with big eyes, and soft brown curls escaping from under a demure but very becoming mob cap.",f
22529,"She measured five foot nothing in her stockings, and was sometimes referred to by her large husband as the Midget.",f
22530,"Needless to say, this flippant appellation was in no wise encouraged by the lady.",f
22531,"She decided that Miles had come to the end of his repast, and, planting two dimpled elbows on the table, she rested her small chin in her hands and looked across at him with something of the air of an inquisitive kitten.",f
22532,"""Miles!""",f
22533,"O'Hara leaned back in his chair, and at the sight of her fresh prettiness his brow cleared and he smiled.",f
22534,"""Well, asthore?""",f
22535,A reproachful finger was raised and a pair of red lips pouted adorably.,f
22536,"""Now, Miles, confess you've been vastly disagreeable this morning.",f
22537,"Twice have I spoken to you and you've not troubled to answer me--nay, let me finish!",f
22538,And once you growled at me like a nasty bear!,f
22539,"Yes, sir, you did!""",f
22540,"""Did I now, Molly?",f
22541,"'Tis a surly brute you're after thinking me, then?",f
22542,"Troth, and I've been sore perplexed, me dear.""",f
22543,Lady O'Hara got up and sidled round to him.,f
22544,"""Have you so, Miles?""",f
22545,He flung an arm about her and drew her on to his knee.,f
22546,"""Sure, yes, Molly.""",f
22547,"""Well then, Miles, had you not better tell me what it is that troubles you?"" she coaxed, laying a persuasive hand on his shoulder.",f
22548,He smiled up at her.,f

22553,"""Nay, Miles, tell me.""",f
22554,"""I see ye mean to have the whole tale out of me, so--""  ""To be sure I do!"" she nodded.",f
22555,He laid a warning finger on her lips and summoned up a mighty frown.,f
22556,"""Now will ye be done interrupting, me lady?""",f
22557,"Not a whit abashed, she bit the finger, pushed it away, and folding her hands in her lap, cast her eyes meekly heavenwards.",f
22558,"With a twinkle in his own eyes the Irishman continued:  ""Well, alanna, ye must know that yesterday evening I was at Kilroy's on a matter of business--and that reminds me, Molly, we had a hand or two at faro and the like before I left, and I had very distressing luck--""  On a sudden my lady's demure air vanished.",f
22559,"""Is that so, Miles?",f

22562,"""Whisht, darlin', 'tis a mere thrifle, I assure you....",f
22563,"Well, as I was saying, on me way home, what should happen but that we be held up by one of these highwaymen--""  My lady's eyes widened in horror, and two little hands clutched at his coat.",f
22564,"""Oh, Miles!""",f
22565,His arm tightened round her waist.,f

22567,"""But, Miles, how terrible!",f
22568,You might have been killed!,f

22573,"She nodded obediently, and dimpled.",f
22574,"""Well, as I say, here was this man standing in the road, pointing his pistol at me.",f
22575,"But will ye believe me, me love, when I tell you that that same pistol was as empty as--my own?""",f
22576,Here he was shaken with laughter.,f
22577,"""Lud, Molly, 'twas the drollest thing!",f
22578,"I had me pistol in me hand, knowing 'twas unloaded, and wondering what the devil, saving your presence, was to do next, when the idea struck me that I should try to bluff me fine sir.",f
22579,"So I cried out that his pistol was unloaded, and completely took him by surprise!",f
22580,Sure he hadn't time to ask himself how the devil I should be knowing that!,f
22581,He dropped it on the road.,f
22582,"Afther--""  ""Miles, you are becoming very Irish!""",f
22583,"""Never say so, alanna.",f
22584,"_After_ that 'twas simple enough, and me lord gave in.",f
22585,"He held out his hands for me to bind--and here's where 'tis puzzling, Molly--I saw that they were a prodigious sight too white and fine for an ordinary highwayman.",f
22586,"So I taxed him with it--""  ""'Twas a gentleman in disguise!",f
22587,"How splendid, Miles!""",f
22588,"""Will ye hold your tongue, asthore, and not be spoiling me story on me?""",f
22589,"""Oh, indeed I am sorry!",f
22590,"I will be good!""",f
22591,"""--and he started and seemed monstrous put out.",f
22592,"What's more, me dear, I heard him speak to his mare in an ordinary, gentleman's voice.",f
22593,"Molly, ye never saw the like of that same mare!",f
22594,"The sweetest--""  ""Pray, never mind the mare, dear!",f

22596,"""Very well, me love, though 'twas a prodigious fine mare--When I heard him speak, it flashed across me brain that I knew him--no, ye don't, Molly!""",f
22597,"His hand was over her mouth as he spoke, and her eyes danced madly.",f
22598,"""But I could not for the life of me think where I had heard that voice: 'twas but the one word I heard him speak, ye understand, and when I held his wrists I felt that 'twas no stranger.",f

22604,"And not another word could I get out of him after beyond 'Yes, sir,' and 'No, sir.'",f
22605,"Still, I felt that 'twas a gentleman all the same, so I--""  He was enveloped in a rapturous embrace.",f
22606,"""You dear Miles!",f
22607,"You let him escape?""",f
22608,"""Sure, alanna, is it meself that would be doing the like?",f
22609,And me a Justice of the Peace withal?,f
22610,"I told them not to handcuff me lord.""",f
22611,"""Oh, I do so wish you had let him escape!",f
22612,"But if 'tis really a gentleman, you will?""",f
22613,"""I will not then, asthore.",f

22615,"""You are very cruel, then.""",f
22616,"""But, me darlin'--""  ""And I wish to get off your knee.""",f
22617,He drew her close.,f
22618,"""I'll see what can be done for your protege, Molly.",f
22619,"But don't be forgetting he tried to kill the only husband you have!""",f
22620,He watched the effect of this with that humorous twinkle in his eye.,f
22621,But my lady was not to be put off.,f
22622,"""With an empty pistol?",f
22623,"Fie on you, Miles!",f
22624,"And may I hide behind the screen while you question him?""",f
22625,"""Ye may not.""",f
22626,"""But I wish so much to see him!""",f
22627,O'Hara shook his head with an air of finality she knew full well.,f
22628,"However easy-going and good-natured her husband might be, there were times when he was impervious to all blandishments.",f
22629,"So after darkly hinting that she would be nearer than he imagined, she gave up the contest to go and visit young Master David in his nursery.",f
22630,"*       *       *       *       *  For some time in lock-up Carstares had cudgelled his brain to think out a possible mode of escape next day, but try as he might he could light on nothing.",f
22631,If only Miles were not to question him!,f
22632,"It was hardly likely that he would be allowed to retain his mask, yet therein lay his only chance of preserving his incognito.",f
22633,He prayed that by some merciful providence O'Hara would either fail to recognise him or would at least pretend that he did not.,f
22634,"Having decided that there was nothing further to be done in the matter he lay down on his extremely hard pallet, and went to sleep as if he had not a care in the world.",f
22635,"Next morning, after a long and wordy argument with the head gaoler on the subject of masks, he was haled in triumph to the house.",f
22636,"As the little cavalcade was about to ascend the steps that led to the front door, my Lady O'Hara came gaily forth carrying a basket and a pair of scissors, and singing a snatch of song.",f
22637,"At the sight of the highwayman the song broke off and her red lips formed a long-drawn ""Oh!""",f
22638,"She stood quite still on the top step, gazing down at my lord.",f
22639,"The two gaolers stood aside to allow her to come down, just as a greyhound darted up the steps and flung itself against her in an exuberance of joy.",f
22640,"My lady, none too securely balanced, reeled; the basket fell from her arm, her foot missed the next step, and she tumbled headlong down.",f
22641,But in the flash of an eyelid Carstares had sprung forward and received her in his arms.,f
22642,He lowered her gently to the ground.,f
22643,"""I trust you are not hurt, madam?"" he asked, and retrieved her basket, handing it to her.",f
22644,Molly took it with a smile.,f
22645,"""I thank you sir, not at all; though I fear I should have injured myself quite considerably had you not been so swift in catching me.",f
22646,"'Twas most kind of you, I am sure!""",f
22647,"She extended her small hand, and her eyes devoured him.",f
22648,"For a moment my lord hesitated, and then, sweeping off his hat, he bowed low over the hand.",f
22649,"""'Twas less than nothing, madam,"" he said in his own cultivated voice.",f
22650,"""I beg you will dismiss it from your mind.""",f
22651,"He straightened himself as the gaolers came forward, and put on his hat again.",f
22652,Lady O'Hara stepped aside and watched them disappear into the house.,f
22653,"Her cheeks were rather flushed, and her eyes suspiciously bright.",f
22654,"Suddenly she nodded her head decisively, and throwing away her luckless basket, hurried across the lawn and entered the house through a long window.",f
22655,"My lord was conducted to the library, where O'Hara sat awaiting him, and slouched forward with his hands thrust deep into his pockets and his hat still on his head.",f
22656,"The head gaoler eyed him gloomily, and looked pained when Carstares with studied boorishness leaned carelessly against a fine carved table.",f
22657,"""We 'ave refrained from 'andcuffin' pris'ner, sir, at your horders,"" he said, in a tone that warned O'Hara that should harm come of it, on his head be the blame.",f
22658,Miles nodded.,f
22659,"""Quite right,"" he said pleasantly, and glanced at the cloaked and masked figure before him with more suspicion than ever.",f
22660,"""But I regrets to 'ave to report very hobstinate be'aviour on part of pris'ner, sir,"" added the gaoler impressively.",f
22661,"""Indeed?"" said Miles gravely.",f
22662,"""How so?""",f
22663,"Jack controlled an insane desire to laugh, and listened to the gaoler's complaint.",f
22664,"""You see the pris'ner, sir, with that great mask on 'is face?",f
22665,"Afore we set out to come 'ere, I told 'im to take it hoff.",f
22666,"And 'e refoosed, sir.",f
22667,"Seeing as 'ow you gave no horders, I did not force 'im to hobey.""",f
22668,"""Ah! ...",f
22669,"Your name, please?""",f
22670,"""John Smith, sir,"" answered Carstares promptly and hoarsely.",f
22671,O'Hara wrote it down with a sceptical smile on his lips that Jack did not quite like.,f
22672,"""Perhaps ye will have the goodness to unmask?""",f
22673,There was a momentary silence.,f
22674,"""Why, sir, I thought ye might allow me to keep it on?""",f
22675,"""Did ye now?",f
22676,"I will not be allowing any such thing.""",f
22677,"""But, sir--""  ""'Tis impossible.",f
22678,"Off with it!""",f
22679,"""Sir--""  ""If ye don't take it off, I shall ask these men to assist ye,"" warned Miles.",f
22680,"""May I not speak with ye alone, sir?"" pleaded Jack.",f
22681,By now O'Hara was greatly intrigued.,f
22682,"""Ye may not.",f
22683,"Unmask!""",f
22684,"He was leaning half across the table, his eyes fixed on Jack's face.",f
22685,"With a quaint little laugh that made O'Hara's brows contract swiftly, my lord shrugged his shoulders French fashion and obeyed.",f
22686,"The mask and hat were tossed lightly on to the table, and Miles found himself gazing into a pair of blue eyes that met his half defiantly, half imploringly.",f
22687,He drew in his breath sharply and the thin ivory rule he held snapped suddenly between his fingers.,f
22688,"And at that crucial moment a door behind him that had stood ajar was pushed open, and my Lady O'Hara came tripping into the room.",f
22689,"The two gaolers and her husband turned at once to see who it was, while Jack, who had recognised her, but had not the least idea who she was, fell to dusting his boots with his handkerchief.",f
22690,"O'Hara rose, and for once looked severe.",f
22691,"""What--"" he began, and stopped, for without so much as a glance at him, my lady ran towards the prisoner, crying:  ""Harry!",f
22692,"Oh, Harry!""",f
22693,"Jack gathered that he was the person addressed, and instantly made her an elaborate leg.",f
22694,"The next moment she was tugging at the lapels of his coat, with her face upturned to his.",f
22695,"""Harry, you WICKED boy!"" she cried, and added beneath her breath: ""My name is Molly!""",f
22696,A laugh sprang to my lord's eyes and his beautiful smile appeared.,f
22697,"In a stupefied fashion O'Hara watched him steal an arm about her waist, and place a hand beneath her chin.",f
22698,"The next instant a kiss was planted full on the little lady's lips, and he heard Jack Carstares' voice exclaim:  ""Fie on you, Molly, for a spoil-sport!",f
22699,"Here had I fooled Miles to the top of my bent--and 'pon rep.! he scarce knows me yet!""",f
22700,"My lady disengaged herself, blushing.",f
22701,"""Oh, Miles, you do know Harry--my cousin Harry?""",f
22702,O'Hara collected his scattered wits and rose nobly to the occasion.,f
22703,"""Of course I do, me dear, though at first he gave me such a shock, I was near dumbfounded.",f
22704,"Ye are a mad, scatter-brained fellow to play such a thrick upon us, devil take ye!""",f
22705,He laid his hands on Jack's shoulders.,f
22706,"""Pray, what did ye do it for, boy?""",f
22707,Jack's brain worked swiftly.,f
22708,"""Why, Miles, never tell me you've forgot our wager!",f
22709,Did I not swear I'd have you at a disadvantage--to be even with you for that night at Jasper's?,f
22710,But what must you do but see my pistol was unloaded and make me lose my wager!,f
22711,"Still, 'twas worth that and a night in gaol to see your face when I unmasked!""",f
22712,"O'Hara shook him slightly, laughing, and turned to the two amazed gaolers.",f
22713,"The senior gaoler met his humorous glance with a cold and indignant stare, and gave a prodigious sniff.",f
22714,"""Me good fellows,"" drawled Miles, ""I'm mighty sorry ye've been worried over me young cousin here.",f
22715,"He's fooled us all it appears, but now there's nought to be done in the matter, though I've a mind to send him to await the next sessions!""",f
22716,"He slipped a guinea into each curiously ready palm, and replied to the head gaoler's haughty bow with a pleasant nod.",f
22717,In silence he watched them leave the room shaking their heads over the incomprehensible ways of the gentry.,f
22718,Then he turned and looked across at Carstares.,f
22719,"CHAPTER X  LADY O'HARA RETIRES   For a long minute silence reigned, all three actors in the little comedy listening to the heavy footsteps retreating down the passage, Carstares with one arm still around my lady's waist and a rather strained look on his face.",f
22720,"Molly instinctively felt that something beyond her ken was in the air, and glanced fearfully up at the white face above her.",f
22721,The expression in the blue eyes fixed on her husband made her turn sharply to look at him.,f
22722,"She found that he was staring at my lord as though he saw a ghost: She wanted to speak, to relieve the tension, but all words stuck in her throat, and she could only watch the _denouement_ breathlessly.",f
22723,"At last O'Hara moved, coming slowly towards them, reading John's countenance.",f
22724,"Some of the wonder went out of his face, and, as if he sensed the other's agony of mind, he smiled suddenly and laid his hands once more on the straight, stiff shoulders.",f
22725,"""Jack, ye rascal, what do ye mean by hugging and kissing me wife under me very eyes?""",f
22726,"Molly all at once remembered the position of her ""Cousin Harry's"" arm, and gave a little gasp, whisking herself away.",f
22727,My lord put out his hands and strove to thrust his friend off.,f
22728,"""Miles, don't forget--don't forget--what I am!""",f
22729,"The words were forced out, but his head was held high.",f
22730,"""Tare an' ouns, man!",f
22731,And is it meself that'll be caring what ye may or may not be?,f
22732,"Oh, Jack, Jack, I'm so pleased to see ye, that I can scarce realise 'tis yourself I am looking at!",f
22733,"When did ye come to England, and what-a-plague are you doing in that costume?""",f
22734,"He jerked his head to where John's mask lay, and wrung the hand he held as though he would never stop.",f
22735,"""I've been in England a year.",f
22736,"As to the mask--!""",f
22737,He shrugged and laughed.,f
22738,Lady O'Hara pushed in between them.,f
22739,"""But please I do not understand!"" she said plaintively.",f
22740,Carstares bowed over her hand.,f
22741,"""May I be permitted to thank you for your kindly intervention, my lady?",f
22742,"And to congratulate Miles on his marriage?""",f
22743,She dimpled charmingly and curtsied.,f
22744,Her husband caught her round the waist.,f
22745,"""Ay, the saucy minx!",f
22746,"Oh, me cousin Harry, forsooth!",f
22747,"If it had been anyone but Jack I should be angry with ye, asthore, for 'twas a wicked thrick to play entirely!""",f
22748,She patted his hand and smiled across at Jack.,f
22749,"""Of course, I would never have done such a forward thing had I not known that he was indeed a gentleman--and had he not saved me from sudden death!"" she added as an afterthought.",f
22750,Miles looked sharply round at her and then at Carstares.,f
22751,"""What's this?""",f
22752,"""My lady exaggerates,"" smiled my lord.",f
22753,"""'Tis merely that I had the honour to catch her as she fell down the steps this morning.""",f
22754,O'Hara looked relieved.,f
22755,"""Ye are not hurt, alanna?""",f
22756,"""Gracious, no!",f
22757,"But I had to do something to show my gratitude--and I was sure that you would never expose _my_ fraud--so I--But,"" as a sudden thought struck her, ""you seem to _know_ my highwayman!""",f
22758,"""Sure an' I do, Molly.",f
22759,"'Tis none other than Jack Carstares of whom ye've often heard me speak!""",f
22760,She turned round eyes of wonderment upon my lord.,f
22761,"""Can it be--is it possible that you are my husband's dearest friend--Lord John?""",f
22762,Jack flushed and bowed.,f
22763,"""I was once--madam,"" he said stiffly.",f
22764,"""Once!"" she scoffed.",f
22765,"""Oh, if you could but hear him speak of you!",f
22766,"But I'll let you hear him speak _to_ you, which perhaps you'll enjoy more.",f
22767,"I know you've a prodigious great deal to say to one another, so I shall run away and leave you alone.""",f
22768,"She smiled graciously upon him, blew an airy kiss to her husband and went quickly out of the room.",f
22769,"Carstares closed the door behind her and came back to O'Hara, who had flung himself back into his chair, trying, manlike, to conceal the excitement he was feeling.",f
22770,"""Come, sit ye down, Jack, and let me have the whole story!""",f
22771,My lord divested himself of his long cloak and shook out his hitherto tucked-up ruffles.,f
22772,"From the pocket of his elegant scarlet riding coat he drew a snuff-box, which he opened languidly.",f
22773,"With his eyes resting quizzically on O'Hara's face, he took a delicate pinch of snuff and minced across the room.",f
22774,Miles laughed.,f
22775,"""What's this?""",f
22776,"""This, my dear friend, is Sir Anthony Ferndale, Bart.!""",f
22777,He bowed with great flourish.,f

22779,"But come over here, Sir Anthony Ferndale, Bart., and tell me everything.""",f
22780,Jack perched on the edge of the desk and swung his leg.,f
22781,"""Well really, I do not think there is much to tell that you do not already know, Miles.",f
22782,"You know all about Dare's card-party, for instance, precisely six years ago?""",f

22789,"""There never was a time when I would not have been proud to call ye friend, as ye would very well have known, had ye been aught but a damned young hothead!",f

22791,"""It was the obvious thing to do.""",f
22792,"""Maybe, but I fancy I know ye just a little too well to believe any cock-and-bull story I'm told about ye.",f
22793,"And even if I had been fool enough to have believed it, do ye think I'd be going back on ye?",f
22794,"Sure, 'tis a poor friend I'd be!""",f
22795,Jack stared down at the toe of his right boot in silence.,f
22796,"""I know something more than we guessed happened at that same party, and I have me suspicions, but 'tis your affair, and whatever ye did ye had your reasons for.",f
22797,"But, Jack, why in the name of wonder must ye fly off to the devil alone knows where, without so much as a good-bye to anyone?""",f
22798,Carstares never raised his eyes from the contemplation of that boot.,f

22800,"""Miles--in my place--would you not have done the same?""",f
22801,"""Well--""  ""You know you would.",f

22804,O'Hara brought his hand down smartly on the other's knee.,f
22805,"""I'd have thought ye less of a young fool!",f
22806,"I would have gone away with ye, and nothing would have stopped me!""",f
22807,Jack looked up and met his eyes.,f

22882,"A faint, sweet smile curved the fine lips.",f
22883,"""Let us talk of the weather, Miles, or my mare.",f

22885,With an impatient movement O'Hara flung back his chair and strode over to the window with his back to my lord.,f

22888,"""It seems ye do not value your friends too highly!""",f
22889,My lord said never a word.,f

22946,CHAPTER XI  MY LORD TURNS RESCUER AND COMES NIGH ENDING HIS LIFE   Late that afternoon Carstares left Thurze House on one of his friend's horses.,f
22947,"He waved a very regretful farewell to O'Hara and his lady, promising to let them know his whereabouts and to visit them again soon.",f
22948,"O'Hara had extracted a solemn promise that if ever he got into difficulties he would let him know:  ""For I'm not letting ye drift gaily out of me life again, and that's flat.""",f
22949,"Jack had assented gladly enough--to have a friend once more was such bliss--and had given Miles the name of the inn and the village where he would find him, for O'Hara had insisted on bringing the mare over himself.",f
22950,"So Carstares rode off to Trencham and to Jim, with the memory of a very hearty handshake in his mind.",f
22951,"He smiled a little as he thought of his friend's words when he had shown himself reluctant to give the required promise:  ""Ye obstinate young devil, ye'll do as I say, and no nonsense, or ye don't leave this house!""",f
22952,For six years no one had ordered him to obey; it had been he who had done all the ordering.,f
22953,"Somehow it was very pleasant to be told what to do, especially by Miles.",f
22954,He turned down a lane and wondered what Jim was thinking.,f
22955,"That he was waiting at the Green Man, he was certain, for those had been his orders.",f
22956,"He was annoyed with the man over the incident of the pistols, for he had inspected them and discovered that they were indeed unloaded.",f
22957,"Had his captor been other than O'Hara, on whom he could not fire, such carelessness might have proved his undoing.",f
22958,"Apart from that, culpable negligence always roused his wrath.",f
22959,A rather warm twenty minutes was in store for Salter.,f
22960,"For quite an hour Carstares proceeded on his way with no mishaps nor adventures, and then, suddenly, as he rounded a corner of a deserted road--little more than a cart-track--an extraordinary sight met his eyes.",f
22961,"In the middle of the road stood a coach, and by it, covering the men on the box with two large pistols, was a seedy-looking ruffian, while two others were engaged in what appeared to be a life-and-death struggle at the coach-door.",f
22962,Jacked reined-in his horse and rose in his stirrups to obtain a better view.,f
22963,"Then his eyes flashed, and he whistled softly to himself.",f
22964,"For the cause of all the turmoil was a slight, graceful girl of not more than nineteen or twenty.",f
22965,"She was frenziedly resisting the efforts of her captors to drag her to another coach, further up the road.",f
22966,Jack could see that she was dark and very lovely.,f
22967,"Another, elderly lady, was most valiantly impeding operations by clawing and striking at one of the men's arms, scolding and imploring all in one breath.",f
22968,"Jack's gaze went from her to a still, silent figure at the side of the road in the shadow of the hedge, evidently the stage-manager.",f
22969,"""It seems I must take a hand in this,"" he told himself, and laughed joyously as he fixed on his mask and dismounted.",f
22970,"He tethered his mount to a young sapling, took a pistol from its holster, and ran softly and swiftly under the lea of the hedge up to the scene of disaster, just as the man who covered the unruly and vociferous pair on the box made ready to fire.",f
22971,"Jack's bullet took him neatly in the neck, and without a sound he crumpled up, one of his pistols exploding harmlessly as it fell to earth.",f
22972,With an oath the silent onlooker wheeled round to face the point of my lord's gleaming blade.,f
22973,Carstares drew in his breath sharply in surprise as he saw the white face of his Grace of Andover.,f
22974,"""Damn you!"" said Tracy calmly, and sprang back, whipping out his own rapier.",f
22975,"""Certainly,"" agreed Jack pleasantly.",f
22976,"""On guard, M. le Duc!""",f
22977,Tracy's lips curled back in a snarl.,f
22978,His eyes were almost shut.,f
22979,"Over his shoulder he ordered curtly:  ""Keep watch over the girl.",f
22980,"I will attend to this young jackanapes.""",f
22981,On the word the blades clashed.,f
22982,"Jack's eyes danced with the sheer joy of battle, and his point snicked in and out wickedly.",f
22983,"He knew Tracy of old for an expert swordsman, and he began warily.",f
22984,"The girl's persecutors retained a firm hold on either arm, but all their thoughts were centred on the duel.",f
22985,"The men on the box got out their blunderbuss, ready to fire should the need arise, and the girl herself watched breathlessly, red lips apart, and eyes aglow with fright, indignation, and excitement.",f
22986,"As for the old lady, she positively bobbed up and down shrieking encouragement to Carstares.",f
22987,"The blades hissed continuously against one another; time after time the Duke thrust viciously, and ever his point was skilfully parried.",f
22988,"He was absolutely calm, and his lips sneered.",f
22989,"Who it was that he was fighting, he had not the faintest idea; he only knew that his opponent had recognised him, and must be speedily silenced.",f
22990,Therefore he fought with deadly grimness and purpose.,f
22991,"Carstares, on the other hand, had no intention of killing his Grace.",f
22992,"He had never liked him in the old days, but he was far too good-natured to contemplate any serious bloodshed.",f
22993,He was so used to Tracy's little affairs that he had not been filled with surprise when he discovered who the silent figure was.,f
22994,"He did not like interfering with Belmanoir, but, on the other hand, he could no more stand by and see a woman assaulted than he could fly.",f
22995,"So he fought on with the idea of disarming his Grace, so as to have him at a disadvantage and to be able to command his withdrawal from the scene.",f
22996,"Once he feinted cleverly, and lunged, and a little blood trickled down over the Duke's hand.",f
22997,"No sign made Belmanoir, except that his eyelids flickered a moment and his play became more careful.",f
22998,"Once the Duke thrust in tierce and Jack's sword arm wavered an instant, and a splash of crimson appeared on his sleeve.",f
22999,"He, for the most part, remained on the defensive, waiting for the Duke to tire.",f
23000,"Soon his Grace's breath began to come unevenly and fast, and beads of moisture started on his forehead.",f
23001,"Yet never did the sneer fade nor his temper go; he had himself well in hand, and although his face was livid, and his brain on fire with fury, no trace of it showed itself in his sword-play.",f
23002,"Then Carstares changed his tactics, and began to put into practice all the arts and subtleties of fence that he had learnt abroad.",f
23003,"He seemed made of steel and set on wires, so agile and untireable was he.",f
23004,"Time after time he leapt nimbly aside, evading some wicked thrust, and all the while he was driving his Grace back and back.",f
23005,"He was not panting, and now and again he laughed softly and happily.",f
23006,"The blood from the wound on his arm was dripping steadily on to the ground, yet it seemed to Tracy to affect him not at all.",f
23007,"But Jack himself knew that he was losing strength rapidly, and must make an end.",f
23008,"Suddenly he feinted, and fell back.",f
23009,Tracy saw his advantage and pressed forward within the wavering sword-point.,f
23010,"The next instant his sword was whirled from his grasp, and he lay on the ground, unhurt but helpless, gazing up at the masked face and at the shortened rapier.",f
23011,"How he had been thrown he did not know, but that his opponent was a past master in the art of fence he was perfectly sure.",f
23012,My lord gave a little chuckle and twisted a handkerchief about his wounded arm.,f
23013,"""I am aware, m'sieur, that this is most unusual--and, in duels--forbidden.",f
23014,"But I am sure that milor' will agree that the circumstances are also--most unusual--and the odds--almost overwhelming!""",f
23015,"He turned his head to the two men, one of whom released his hold on the girl's arm and started forward.",f
23016,"""Oh, no!"" drawled my lord, shaking his head.",f
23017,"""Another step and I spit your master where he lies.""",f
23018,"""Stand,"" said his Grace calmly.",f
23019,"""_Bien_!",f
23020,"Throw your arms down here at my feet, and--ah--release Mademoiselle!""",f
23021,"They made no move to obey, and my lord shrugged deprecatingly, lowering his point to Tracy's throat.",f
23022,"""_Eh bien!_""  They still hesitated, casting anxious glances at their master.",f
23023,"""Obey,"" ordered the Duke.",f
23024,"Each man threw down a pistol, eyeing Jack furtively, while the girl ran to her aunt, who began to soothe and fuss over her.",f
23025,Jack stifled a yawn.,f
23026,"""It is not my intention to remain here all night.",f
23027,Neither am I a child--or a fool.,f
23028,"_Depechez!_""  Belmanoir saw that the coachman had his blunderbuss ready and was only too eager to fire it, and he knew that the game was up.",f
23029,He turned his head towards the reluctant bullies who looked to him for orders.,f
23030,"""Throw down everything!"" he advised.",f
23031,Two more pistols and two daggers joined their comrades.,f
23032,"""A thousand thanks!"" bowed my lord, running a quick eye over the men.",f
23033,"""M. le Duc, I pray you be still.",f
23034,"Now, you with the large nose--yes, _mon ami_, you--go pick up the pistol our defunct friend dropped.""",f
23035,The man indicated slouched over to the dead body and flung another pistol on to the heap.,f
23036,My lord shook his head impatiently.,f
23037,"""_Mais non_.",f
23038,Have I not said that I am not entirely a fool?,f
23039,"The unexploded pistol, please.",f
23040,"You will place it here, _doucement._ Very good.""",f
23041,His eye travelled to the men on the box.,f
23042,"The coachman touched his hat and cried:  ""I'm ready, sir!""",f
23043,"""It is very well.",f
23044,"Be so good as to keep these gentlemen covered, but do not fire until I give the order.",f
23045,"And now, M. le Duc, have I your parole that you will return swiftly from whence you came, leaving this lady unmolested, an I permit you to rise?""",f
23046,Tracy moved his head impatiently.,f
23047,"""I have no choice.""",f
23048,"""Monsieur, that is not an answer.",f
23049,"Have I your parole?""",f
23050,"""Yes, curse you!""",f
23051,"""But certainly,"" said Jack politely.",f
23052,"""Pray rise.""",f
23053,"He rested his sword-point on the ground, and watched Tracy struggle to his feet.",f
23054,"For an instant the Duke stood staring at him, with face slightly out-thrust.",f
23055,"""I almost think I know you,"" he said softly, caressingly.",f
23056,Jack's French accent became a shade more pronounced.,f
23057,"""It is possible.",f
23058,"I at least have the misfortune to know monsieur by sight.""",f
23059,"Tracy ignored the insult, and continued very, very silkily:  ""One thing is certain: I shall know you again--if I meet you!""",f
23060,"Even as the words left his mouth Jack saw the pistol in his hand and sprang quickly to one side, just in time to escape a shot that would have gone straight through his head.",f
23061,"As it was, it caught him in his left shoulder.",f
23062,"""Do not fire!"" he called sharply to the coachman, and bowed to his Grace.",f
23063,"""As I was saying, m'sieu--do not let me detain you, I beg.""",f
23064,"The Duke's green eyes flashed venom for a minute, and then the heavy lids descended over them again, and he returned the bow exaggeratedly.",f
23065,"""_Au revoir_, monsieur,"" he smiled, and bent to pick up his sword.",f
23066,"""It will--not be necessary for--m'sieu to--take his sword,"" said Jack.",f
23067,"""I have a--desire to keep--it as a--souvenir.",f
23068,"Yes.""",f
23069,"""As you will, monsieur,"" replied Tracy carelessly, and walked away to his coach, his men following close on his heels.",f
23070,"My lord stood leaning heavily on his sword, watching them go, and not until the coach had swung out of sight did he give way to the weakness that was overwhelming him.",f
23071,"Then he reeled and would have fallen, had it not been for two cool hands that caught his, steadying him.",f
23072,"A tremulous, husky voice sounded in his ears:  ""You are hurt!",f
23073,"Ah, sir, you are hurt for my sake!""",f
23074,"With a great effort Jack controlled the inclination to swoon, and lifted the girl's hand shakily to his lips.",f
23075,"""It is a--pleasure--mademoiselle,"" he managed to gasp.",f
23076,"""Now--you may--I think--proceed--in safety.""",f
23077,"Diana slipped an arm under his shoulder and cast an anxious glance at the footman, hurrying towards them.",f
23078,"""Quick!"" she commanded.",f
23079,"""Sir, you are faint!",f
23080,"You must allow my servant to assist you to the coach.""",f
23081,Jack forced a smile.,f
23082,"""It is--nothing--I assure you--pray do not--I--"" and he fainted comfortably away into stout Thomas's arms.",f
23083,"""Carry him into the coach, Thomas!"" ordered the girl.",f
23084,"""Mind his arm, and--oh! his poor shoulder.",f
23085,"Aunt, have you something to bind his wounds with?""",f

23090,"Yes, lay him on the seat.""",f
23091,"My lord was lowered gently on to the cushions, and Miss Betty fluttered over to him like a distracted hen.",f
23092,"Then Diana told Thomas to take charge of my lord's horse that they could see, quietly nibbling the grass further down the road, stooped and picked up his Grace of Andover's sword, with its curiously wrought hilt, and jumped into the coach to help Miss Betty to attend to Jack's wounds.",f
23093,"The slash on the arm was not serious, but where the pistol had taken him was very ugly-looking.",f
23094,"While she saw to that, Miss Betty loosened the cravat and removed my lord's mask.",f

23099,"So she ran on, hunting wildly for her salts.",f
23100,"Diana looked up as her aunt finished, and studied the pale face lying against the dark cushions.",f
23101,"She noted the firm, beautifully curved mouth, the aristocratic nose and delicately pencilled eyebrows, with a little thrill.",f
23102,"The duel had set her every nerve tingling; she was filled with admiration for her preserver, and the sight of his sensitive, handsome countenance did nothing to dispel that admiration.",f
23103,She held the salts to his nostrils and watched eagerly for some sign of life.,f
23104,"But none was forthcoming, and she had to be content with placing cushions beneath his injured shoulder, and guarding him as best she might from the jolts caused by the uneven surface of the road.",f
23105,"Miss Betty bustled about and did all she could to stanch the bleeding, and when they had comfortably settled my lord, she sat down upon the seat opposite and nodded decisively.",f
23106,"""We can do no more, my dear--but, yes--certainly bathe his forehead with your lavender water.",f
23107,"Dear me, what an escape!",f

23115,"""Nonsense, my dear!",f

23119,"With this comfortable assurance, she nodded again and leant back against the cushions, watching her niece's ministrations with a professional and slightly amused air.",f

23497,"I trust your shoulder no longer pains you?""",f
23498,My lord pushed Jim gently to one side and placed his hand in Mr. Beauleigh's.,f
23499,"""I thank you, sir, it is almost well.",f
23500,"But for Miss Betty, who, I fear, has the makings of a true tyrant, I should not wear this obnoxious sling.""",f
23501,Mr. Beauleigh smiled a little.,f
23502,"""Ah, yes, she keeps us all in order, does Betty.",f
23503,"Pray, will you not walk a little in the garden?",f
23504,"There are chairs on the lawn--and here is my daughter.""",f
23505,"He waved to the door, and Carstares, turning, beheld Diana.",f
23506,"She stood framed by the dark wood, gowned in amber silk, with old lace falling from her elbows and over the bosom of her dress.",f
23507,"Her hair was dark as night, with little tendrils curling over her broad, white brow.",f
23508,"One rolling curl fell over her shoulder, the rest were gathered up under a small lace cap, which was secured by means of a riband passed beneath her chin.",f
23509,"Jack gazed, and gazed again, and in her turn Diana studied him with wide brown eyes of almost childlike innocence.",f
23510,"Then her lids fluttered and curling lashes veiled the glorious depths, as a slow blush mounted to her cheeks.",f
23511,My lord recovered his manners and made his most approved leg as her father presented him.,f
23512,"""My love, this is Mr. Carr--""  Diana sank into a curtsey.",f
23513,"""--and, Mr. Carr, this is my daughter, Diana.""",f
23514,"""I am delighted to make Miss Beauleigh's acquaintance,"" said John, and raised her hand to his lips.",f
23515,"The delicate, tapering fingers trembled a little in his hold, and tremulous lips parted in the shyest and most adorable smile that he had ever seen.",f
23516,"""Indeed, sir, we are already acquainted.",f
23517,"I am not like to forget my rescuer.""",f
23518,"""I am happy to think that I was able to be of some service to you, mademoiselle.",f
23519,"Believe me, it was an honour to fight in your cause.""",f
23520,His eyes were on the fascinating dimple that played about her mouth.,f
23521,"""'Tis very kind of you to say so, sir.",f
23522,"I fear we greatly incommoded you--and--"" She made a gesture towards his sling.",f
23523,"""That, mademoiselle, is less than nothing.",f
23524,"All the obligation is on my side.""",f
23525,Miss Betty bustled forward.,f
23526,"""Now that will do!",f
23527,I never heard such a foolish set of compliments!,f
23528,"You are looking tired, Mr. Carr; come into the garden and rest.""",f
23529,"Salter stepped forward, but Diana stayed him with uplifted finger.",f
23530,"""If Mr. Carr will accept my arm?"" she hazarded.",f
23531,Jack flushed.,f
23532,"""Indeed, no, Miss Beauleigh--I can--""  ""Oh, tut-tut!"" cried Miss Betty.",f
23533,"""Have done dilly-dallying!",f
23534,"Take him out, Di!""",f
23535,Mr. Beauleigh had already disappeared.,f
23536,"His world lay in his library, and he was never far from it for any length of time.",f
23537,"Now he had seized the moment when his sister was not looking to withdraw quietly, and, when she turned round, she was only in time to see the library door close softly.",f
23538,"""Your papa has gone again,"" she remarked to her niece.",f
23539,"""What a trying man he is, to be sure!""",f
23540,"She followed the pair out on to the lawn, and helped to make Carstares seat himself in a long chair under a great elm.",f
23541,A cushion was placed under his wounded shoulder and another at his back.,f
23542,"""And are you sure that you are quite comfortable?"" inquired Miss Betty, anxiously bending over him.",f
23543,Jack laughed up at her.,f
23544,"""Quite sure, thank you, madam.",f
23545,"But where will you sit?""",f
23546,"""I shall sit in this chair, and Di will sit on a cushion""--throwing one down--""at my feet--so.""",f
23547,"""I see that you are all ruled with a rod of iron, mademoiselle,"" he said, and watched the dimple tremble into being.",f
23548,"""Indeed, yes, sir.",f
23549,"'Tis very sad.""",f
23550,"Miss Betty chuckled, and unrolled a packet of silks which she threw into her niece's lap.",f
23551,"""Will you have the goodness to sort those for me, love?"" she asked, taking out her embroidery.",f
23552,"""Pray allow me to assist!"" pleaded John.",f
23553,Diana rose and planted her cushion down beside his chair.,f
23554,She then knelt down upon it and emptied the multi-coloured strands on to his knee.,f
23555,"""Very well!",f
23556,"You must be very careful to separate the different pinks, though.",f
23557,"See, we will have the rose here, the salmon here, the deeper rose here, the pale pink over there, and the reds--there is no more room--we will put the reds in this paper.""",f
23558,"""Certainly,"" agreed Carstares.",f
23559,"""Are we to leave the other colours until the pinks are sorted?""",f
23560,She nodded and bent her head over the silks.,f
23561,"""Is Sir Miles coming this afternoon, Mr. Carr?""",f
23562,"""Why yes, Miss Betty--now you mention it, I remember that he is.",f
23563,"Miss Beauleigh, I defy you to put that one on the rose pile;",f
23564,"'tis a shade too deep.""",f
23565,"""I am sure 'tis not!",f
23566,"Where is one to compare with it?""",f
23567,Carstares produced a long thread and held it next to hers.,f
23568,The two heads were bent close over it.,f
23569,Diana sighed.,f
23570,"""You are right;",f
23571,I can just see the difference.,f
23572,"But 'tis _very_ slight!""",f
23573,Miss Betty peeped over their shoulders.,f
23574,"""Gracious, what an eye you must have!",f
23575,"I can detect no difference.""",f
23576,Her eye ran along the row of silks laid out on my lord's white satin leg.,f
23577,"""Mr. Carr,"" said Diana suddenly, ""I want to ask you something--something that has been puzzling me.""",f
23578,"""Faith, what is it, Miss Beauleigh?""",f
23579,"""Just this: why did you call Mr. Everard M. le Duc?""",f
23580,There was a tiny pause.,f
23581,My lord looked down into the gold-flecked eyes and frowned a little.,f
23582,"""Did I call him that?""",f
23583,"""Yes, I remember it distinctly.",f
23584,"Was it just--a manner of speaking?""",f
23585,"""Just a manner of speaking....",f
23586,"You may call it that, mademoiselle.",f
23587,"Do you not think that he looks rather ducal?""",f
23588,"""I tried not to think of him at all.",f
23589,"I hate him!""",f
23590,"""Almost I begin to pity this Mr. Everard,"" quoth Jack.",f
23591,The dimple peeped out.,f
23592,"""Then 'tis most ungallant of you, sir!"" she reproved.",f
23593,"""Do you know Mr. Everard?""",f
23594,"""I have certainly seen him before, madam.""",f
23595,Diana sat back on her heels and eyed him wonderingly.,f
23596,"""I believe you do not wish to answer me,"" she said slowly.",f
23597,"""Tell me, is 'Everard' that man's real name?""",f
23598,My lord twisted the ring on his finger uneasily.,f
23599,"He did not feel himself at liberty to expose Belmanoir, and if he should reveal his true identity, it was quite possible that Mr. Beauleigh might seek him out, in which case he himself might be recognised.",f
23600,He looked up.,f
23601,"""Pardon me, mademoiselle, but whence this cross-examination?""",f
23602,Diana nodded placidly.,f
23603,"""I thought you would refuse, but I have discovered something that will confound you, sir!""",f
23604,She rose to her feet.,f
23605,"""I will go and get it.""",f
23606,"She walked gracefully away towards the house, and my lord watched her go.",f
23607,"""Now _I_ am going to ask a question,"" broke in Miss Betty's voice.",f
23608,He threw out an imploring hand.,f
23609,"""Madam, I beg you will consider my feeble condition.",f
23610,"Am I fit to bear the strain, think you?""",f
23611,"""I do!--Is it usual for gentlemen to ride masked, as you were?""",f
23612,At that he laughed.,f
23613,"""No, madam, but for the gentlemen of the High Toby, it is _de regie_.""",f
23614,"She paused, with her needle held in mid-air:  ""Now, what mean you by that?""",f
23615,"""Just that I am a common highwayman, Miss Betty.""",f
23616,"She stared at him for a moment, and then resumed her work.",f
23617,"""You look it.""",f
23618,John cast a startled glance down his slim person.,f
23619,"""Is that so, madam?",f
23620,"And I rather flattered myself I did not!""",f
23621,"""I was only laughing at you.",f
23622,"You do not expect me to believe that fabrication--surely?""",f
23623,"""I fear I do,"" he sighed.",f
23624,"""'Tis very true, alack!""",f
23625,"""Oh, indeed?",f
23626,"Also a friend of Sir Miles O'Hara, _J.P_.--and of Mr. Everard?""",f
23627,"""At least the last-named is not an acquaintance to be proud of,"" he retorted.",f
23628,"""Perhaps not.",f
23629,"My Di says he is some great gentleman.""",f
23630,"""I perceive that your Di is by nature suspicious.",f
23631,"Why does she think that?""",f
23632,"""You will see.",f
23633,"Di, love, here is Mr. Carr trying to make me believe that he is a highwayman!""",f
23634,Diana came up to them smiling.,f
23635,"""I fear he teases you, aunt.",f
23636,"Do you remember this, sir?""",f
23637,Into Jack's hands she put his Grace of Andover's sword.,f
23638,"Carstares took it, surprised, and glanced casually at the hilt.",f
23639,Then he started up.,f
23640,"""Why, 'tis his sword.",f
23641,And I thought 'twas left on the roadside.,f
23642,"Can it be--did _you_ bring it, mademoiselle?""",f
23643,"She dropped him a curtsey, and laughed.",f
23644,"""You are surprised, sir?",f
23645,"You demanded the sword, so I naturally supposed that you required it.",f
23646,"Therefore I brought it home.""",f
23647,"""'Twas monstrous thoughtful of you then.",f
23648,I dared not hope that it had not been forgotten.,f
23649,"I am very grateful--""  ""Then pray show your gratitude by sitting down again!"" advised the elder Miss Beauleigh.",f
23650,"""Remember that this is your first day up, and have a care!""",f
23651,"John subsided obediently, turning the sword over in his hands.",f
23652,Diana pointed to the wrought gold hilt with an accusing finger.,f
23653,"""An I mistake not, sir, that is a coronet.""",f
23654,My lord's eyes followed the pink-tipped finger and rested wrathfully upon the arms of Andover.,f
23655,"It was like Tracy to flaunt them on his sword-hilt, he reflected.",f
23656,"""It certainly has that appearance,"" he admitted cautiously.",f
23657,"""Also, those are not paste, but real diamonds, and that is a ruby.""",f
23658,"""I do not dispute it, madam,"" he answered meekly.",f
23659,"""And I believe that that big stone is an emerald.""",f
23660,"""I am very much afraid that it is.""",f
23661,"""An expensive toy!"" she said, and looked sharply at him.",f
23662,"""Ornate, I agree, but as true a piece of steel as ever I saw,"" replied my lord blandly, balancing the rapier on one finger.",f
23663,"""A very expensive toy!"" she repeated sternly.",f
23664,John sighed.,f
23665,"""True, madam--true.""",f
23666,"Then with a brightened air: ""Perhaps Mr. Everard has expensive tastes?""",f
23667,"""It is very possible.",f
23668,"And I think that Mr. Everard must have been more than a simple country gentleman to indulge those tastes.""",f
23669,"Carstares bit his lip to hide a smile at the thought of Tracy in the light of a simple country gentleman, and shook his head sadly.",f
23670,"""Do you infer that he came by this sword dishonestly, madam?""",f
23671,The dimple quivered and was gone.,f
23672,"""Sir, I believe that you are playing with me,"" she said with great dignity.",f
23673,"""Madam, I am abashed.""",f
23674,"""I am very glad to hear it, then.",f
23675,"I infer that Mr. Everard was something more than he pretended to be.""",f
23676,"""In truth, a sorry rogue to deceive a lady.""",f
23677,"""And I want to know if I am right.",f
23678,"Is he, perhaps, some grand gentleman?""",f
23679,"""I can assure you, madam, that there is very little of the gentleman about Mr. Everard.""",f
23680,Miss Betty began to laugh.,f
23681,"""Have done, my dear!",f
23682,"'Tis of no avail, and 'tis impolite to press Mr. Carr too hard.""",f
23683,Diana pouted.,f
23684,"""He is monstrous provoking, I think,"" she said, and eyed him reproachfully.",f
23685,"""I am desolated,"" mourned Jack, but his eyes danced.",f
23686,"""And now you are laughing!""",f
23687,"""But then, mademoiselle, so are you!""",f
23688,"She shook her head, resolutely repressing the dimple.",f
23689,"""Then I am inconsolable.""",f
23690,The brown eyes sparkled and her lips parted in spite of her efforts to keep them in a stern line.,f
23691,"""Oh, but you are ridiculous!"" she cried, and sprang to her feet.",f
23692,"""And here is Sir Miles!""",f
23693,"O'Hara came across the lawn towards them, bowed to the ladies, and glanced inquiringly from one to the other.",f
23694,"""Is it a joke ye have?"" he asked.",f
23695,Diana answered him.,f
23696,"""Indeed no, sir.",f
23697,"'Tis Mr. Carr who is so provoking.""",f
23698,"""Provoking, is it?",f
23699,"And what has he been doing?""",f
23700,"""I'll tell you the whole truth, Miles,"" interposed the maligned one.",f
23701,"""'Tis Mistress Diana who is so inquisitive!""",f
23702,"""Oh!""",f
23703,"Diana blushed furiously ""I protest you are unkind, sir!""",f
23704,"""Sure, 'tis no gentleman he is, at all!""",f
23705,"""'Twas on the subject of gentlemen that we--""  ""Quarrelled,"" supplied her aunt.",f
23706,"""Disagreed,"" amended his lordship.",f
23707,"""Disagreed,"" nodded Diana.",f
23708,"""I asked him whether Mr. Everard was not some grand gentleman, and he evaded the point.""",f
23709,"""I vow 'tis slander!"" cried Jack.",f
23710,"""I merely said that Everard was no gentleman at all.""",f
23711,"""There!",f
23712,"And was not that evading the point, Sir Miles?""",f
23713,"""Was it?",f
23714,"Sure, I'm inclined to agree with him.""",f
23715,"""I declare you are both in league against me!"" she cried, with greater truth than she knew.",f
23716,"""I mean, was he perhaps a _titled_ gentleman?""",f
23717,"""But how should Jack know that?""",f
23718,"""Because I am sure he knows him--or, at least, of him.""",f
23719,"""Listen, Mistress Di,"" broke in my lord, shooting a warning glance at O'Hara.",f
23720,"""I will tell you all about Mr. Everard, and I hope you will be satisfied with my tale.""",f
23721,He paused and seemed to cudgel his brain.,f
23722,"""First he is, of course, titled--let me see--yes, he is a Duke.",f
23723,"Oh, he is certainly a Duke--and I am not sure but what he is royal--he--""  ""Now you are ridiculous!"" cried Miss Betty.",f
23724,"""You are very teasing,"" said Diana, and tried to frown.",f
23725,"""First you pretend to know nothing about Mr. Everard, and then you tell me foolish stories about him.",f
23726,"A Duke, indeed!",f
23727,"I believe you _really_ do know nothing about him!""",f
23728,"As Carstares had hoped, she refused to believe the truth.",f
23729,"""He is playing with ye, child,"" said O'Hara, who had listened to Jack's tale with a face of wonder.",f
23730,"""I warrant he knows no Everard--eh, Jack?""",f
23731,"""No, I cannot say that I do,"" laughed his lordship.",f
23732,"""But--but--you said--""  ""Never mind what he said, Miss Di.",f
23733,"'Tis a scurvy fellow he is.""",f
23734,She regarded him gravely.,f
23735,"""Indeed, I almost think so.""",f
23736,But the dimple peeped out for all that!,f
23737,"The next instant it was gone, and Diana turned a face of gloom to her aunt, pouting her red lips adorably, so thought my lord.",f
23738,"""Mr. Bettison,"" she said in accents of despair.",f
23739,"At these mystic words, Jack saw Miss Betty frown, and heard her impatient remark: ""Drat the man!""",f
23740,"He looked towards the house, and perceived a short, rather stout, young man to be walking with a peculiar strutting gait towards them.",f
23741,"The boy was good-looking, Carstares acknowledged to himself, but his eyes were set too close.",f
23742,And he did not like his style.,f
23743,"No, certainly he did not like his style, nor the proprietary way in which he kissed Diana's hand.",f
23744,"""How agreeable it is to see you again, Mr. Bettison!"" said Miss Betty with much affability.",f
23745,"""I declare 'tis an age since we set eyes on you!""",f
23746,"""Oh, no, Aunt,"" contradicted Diana sweetly.",f
23747,"""Why, it was only a very short while ago that Mr. Bettison was here, _surely_!""",f
23748,"She withdrew the hand that the young man seemed inclined to hold fast to, and turned to John.",f
23749,"""I think you do not know Mr. Bettison, Mr. Carr?"" she said.",f
23750,"""Mr. Bettison, allow me to present you to Mr. Carr.",f
23751,"Sir Miles I think you know?""",f
23752,The squire bowed with a great deal of stiff hostility.,f
23753,Carstares returned the bow.,f
23754,"""You will excuse my not rising, I beg,"" he smiled.",f
23755,"""As you perceive--I have had an accident.""",f
23756,Light dawned on Bettison.,f
23757,"This was the man who had rescued Diana, confound his impudence!",f
23758,"""Ah, yes, sir!",f
23759,"Your arm, was it not?",f
23760,"My faith, I should be proud of such a wound!""",f
23761,"It seemed to Carstares that he smiled at Diana in a damned familiar fashion, devil take his impudence!",f
23762,"""It was indeed a great honour, sir.",f
23763,"Mistress Di, I have finished sorting your green silks.""",f
23764,"Diana sank down on the cushion again, and shook some more strands out on to his knee.",f
23765,"""How quick you have been!",f
23766,"Now we will do the blue ones.""",f
23767,Bettison glared.,f
23768,"This fellow seemed prodigious intimate with Diana, devil take him!",f
23769,"He sat down beside Miss Betty, and addressed my lord patronisingly.",f
23770,"""Let me see--er--Mr. Carr.",f
23771,"Have I met you in town, I wonder?",f
23772,"At Tom's, perhaps?""",f
23773,"This country bumpkin _would_ belong to Tom's, reflected John savagely, for no reason at all.",f
23774,"Aloud he said:  ""I think it extremely unlikely, sir.",f
23775,"I have been abroad some years.""",f
23776,"""Oh, indeed, sir?",f
23777,"The 'grand tour,' I suppose?""",f
23778,Mr. Bettison's tone was not the tone of one who supposes any such thing.,f
23779,John smiled.,f
23780,"""Not this time,"" he said, ""that was seven years ago.""",f
23781,"Mr. Bettison had heard rumours of this fellow who, it was murmured, was nought but a common highwayman.",f
23782,"""Really?",f
23783,"After Cambridge, perhaps?""",f
23784,"""Oxford,"" corrected Carstares gently.",f
23785,Curse his audacity! thought Mr. Bettison.,f
23786,"""Seven years ago--let me think.",f
23787,"George must have been on the tour then--Selwyn, I mean, Miss Beauleigh.""",f
23788,"Jack, who had made the tour with several other young bucks fresh down from college, accompanied as far as Paris by the famous wit himself, held his peace.",f
23789,"Mr. Bettison then launched forth into anecdotes of his own tour, and seeing that his friend was entirely engrossed with Miss Diana and her silks, O'Hara felt it incumbent on him to draw the enemy's fire, and, taking his own departure, to bear the squire off with him.",f
23790,"For which he received a grateful smile from my lord, and a kiss blown from the tips of her fingers from Mistress Di, with whom he was on the best of terms.",f
23791,"CHAPTER XIV  MISTRESS DIANA IS UNMAIDENLY   The idyllic summer days passed quickly by, and every time that my lord spoke of leaving, the outcry was so indignant and so firm that he hastily subsided and told himself he would stay just another few days.",f
23792,"His shoulder, having mended up to a certain point, refused quite to heal, and exertion brought the pain back very swiftly.",f
23793,"So his time was for the most part spent with Mistress Di out of doors, helping her with her gardening and her chickens--for Diana was an enthusiastic poultry farmer on a small scale--and ministering to her various pets.",f
23794,"If Fido had a splinter in his paw, it was to Mr. Carr that he was taken; if Nellie, the spaniel, caught a live rabbit, Mr. Carr would assuredly know what to do for it, and the same with all the other animals.",f
23795,"The young pair grew closer and closer together, while Miss Betty and O'Hara watched from afar, the former filled with pride of her darling, and satisfaction, and the latter with apprehension.",f
23796,"O'Hara knew that his friend was falling unconsciously in love, and he feared the time when John should realise it.",f
23797,"He confided these fears to his wife, who, with young David, was staying at her mother's house in Kensington, in a long and very Irish letter.",f
23798,"She replied that he must try and coax my lord into coming to stay with them, when her charms would at once eclipse Mistress Diana's, though to be sure, she could not understand why Miles should not wish him to fall in love, for as he well knew, 'twas a prodigious pleasant sensation.",f
23799,"If he did not know it, then he was indeed most disagreeable.",f
23800,And had he ever heard of anything so wonderful?--David had drawn a picture of a horse!,f
23801,"Yes, really, it was a horse!",f
23802,Was he not a clever child?,f
23803,"Further, would her dearest Miles please come and fetch her home, for although Mamma was prodigious amiable, and wanted her to stay several weeks, she positively could not live without her husband an instant longer than was necessary!",f
23804,"As soon as O'Hara read the last part of the letter he brushed Carstares and his love affairs to one side, and posted straight to London to obey the welcome summons.",f
23805,Bit by bit my lord discovered that he was very much in love with Diana.,f
23806,"At first his heart gave a great bound, and then seemed to stop with a sickening thud.",f
23807,"He remembered that he could not ask her to marry him, disgraced as he was, and he immediately faced the situation, realising that he must go away at once.",f
23808,"His first move was to Mr. Beauleigh, to tell him of his decision.",f
23809,"On being asked why he must so suddenly leave Horton House, he explained that he loved Diana and could not in honour speak of love to her.",f
23810,At which Mr. Beauleigh gasped and demanded to know the reason.,f
23811,"Carstares told him that he was by profession a highwayman, and watched him bridle angrily.",f
23812,"Before so agreeable and so smiling, Mr. Beauleigh now became frigidly polite.",f
23813,"He quite understood Mr. Carr's position, and--er--yes, he honoured him for the course on which he had decided.",f
23814,"But Mr. Beauleigh was very, very cold.",f
23815,"Carstares gave Jim orders to pack immediately, that he might depart next day, and reluctantly informed Miss Betty of his going.",f
23816,She was startled and bewildered.,f
23817,She had imagined that he would spend all June with them.,f

24279,"Half-an-hour later, his _adieux_ made, Jim and the baggage following, my lord rode out with O'Hara on his way to Thurze House.",f
24280,"For some time there was silence between the two men, with only a perfunctory remark or two on the fineness of the day and the freshness of the mare to break it.",f
24281,"Carstares' mind was, as his friend well knew, dwelling on all that he had left behind him.",f
24282,"His parting with Diana had been quite ordinary, she at least making no sign that he was anything beyond a chance acquaintance; indeed, it had almost seemed to him that her attitude was slightly aloof, as if she had drawn a little into herself.",f
24283,"Her hand when he had kissed it had been lifeless and cold, her smile sweetly remote.",f
24284,"He knew that he had held the hand a fraction of a minute longer than was strictly in accordance with the rules of good manners, and he feared that he had clasped it in most unseemly wise, pressing it hard against his lips.",f
24285,He wondered whether she had remarked it.,f
24286,"He little guessed that long after he had ridden out of sight, she continued to feel that pressure.",f
24287,"If he could have seen her passionately kissing each finger separately for fear her lips might pass over the exact spot his had touched, his heart might have been lighter.",f
24288,"It was true that she had retired into her shell, a little hurt at what she termed his man's blind obstinacy.",f
24289,"She had laid her heart bare for him to read; she had offered herself to him as plainly as if she had spoken in terms less general than in the pleasaunce; she had fought desperately for her happiness, thrusting aside all thought of maiden modesty, and when she afterwards had realised what she had done, and tried to imagine what he must think of her, she had blushed dark, and mentally flayed herself for her lack of proper pride and manners.",f
24290,"Terrified that he might think her immodest, overwhelmed with sudden shyness, she had been colder in her attitude towards him, than she had intended, even in her anxiety not to appear forward.",f
24291,"But in spite of her coldness, how intensely had she hoped that he would sense her love and all that she wanted him to know!",f
24292,Incomprehensible the ways of women!,f
24293,"Not endowed with feminine perspicacity or intuition, how could John hope to understand her dual feelings?",f
24294,"He only knew that he had hurt her, and that she had drawn back that she might not lay herself open to more.",f
24295,He could not hope to understand her when she did not fully understand herself.,f
24296,"Reflecting on the swiftness with which love had come to them, he believed that with a like swiftness it might fade, at least from Diana's memory.",f
24297,"He told himself that he hoped for that end, but he was honest enough to know that it was the last thing in the world he wanted.",f
24298,"The mere thought of Diana indifferent to him, or worse, another man's bride, made him bite on his underlip and tighten his hold on the rein.",f
24299,"O'Hara cast many a surreptitious glance at the stern young profile beside him, wondering whether his lordship would last out the tedious ride or no. He knew enough of Carstares' indomitable courage to believe that he would, but he feared that it would prove too great a strain on him in his present weakened condition.",f
24300,"Very wisely he made no attempt to draw Carstares out of his abstraction, but continued to push on in silence, past fields knee-deep in grass, soon to be hay, with sorrel and poppies growing apace, along lanes with hedges high above their heads on either side, over hill and down dale--always in silence.",f
24301,Presently O'Hara fell a little to the rear that he might study his friend without palpably turning to do so.,f
24302,He thought he had never seen Jack's face wear such a black look.,f
24303,"The fine brows almost met over his nose with only two sharp furrows to separate them; the mouth was compressed, the chin a little prominent, and the eyes, staring ahead between Jenny's nervous ears, seemed to see all without absorbing anything.",f
24304,"One hand at his hip was clenched on his riding-whip, the other mechanically guided the mare.",f
24305,"O'Hara found himself admiring the lithe grace of the man, with his upright carriage and splendid seat.",f
24306,"Suddenly, as if aware that he was being studied, my lord half turned his head and met O'Hara's eyes.",f
24307,He gave a tiny shrug and with it seemed to throw off his oppression.,f
24308,"The frown vanished, and he smiled.",f
24309,"""I beg your pardon, Miles.",f
24310,"I am a surly fellow.""",f
24311,"""Mayhap your shoulder troubles you,"" suggested O'Hara tactfully.",f
24312,"""N-no, I am barely conscious of it.",f
24313,"I've no excuse beyond bad manners and a worse temper.""",f
24314,"From thence onward he set himself to entertain his friend, and if his laugh was sometimes rather forced, at least his wit was enough to keep O'Hara in a pleasurable state of amusement for some miles.",f
24315,"By the time they arrived at Thurze House, Carstares was suspiciously white about the mouth, and there was once more a furrow--this time of pain--between his brows.",f
24316,"But he was able to greet my Lady O'Hara with fitting elegance and to pay her at least three neat, laughing compliments before O'Hara took him firmly by the arm and marched him to his room, there to rest and recover before the dinner hour.",f
24317,"Shortly after, Jim arrived, highly contented with his new surroundings, and able to give a satisfactory verdict on Jenny's stalling.",f
24318,"He had quite accepted O'Hara as a friend, after some jealous qualms, and was now well pleased that his master should be in his house instead of roaming the countryside.",f
24319,"At five o'clock, as the gong rang, my lord descended the stairs resplendent in old gold and silver trimmings, determined to be as gay and light-hearted as the occasion demanded, as though there had never been a Diana to upset the whole course of a man's life.",f
24320,Not for nothing had he fought against the world for six long years.,f
24321,"Their teaching had been to hide all feeling beneath a perpetual mask of nonchalance and wit; never for an instance to betray a hurt, and never to allow it to appear that he was anything but the most care-free of men.",f
24322,"The training stood him in good stead now, and even O'Hara wondered to see him in such spirits after all that had passed.",f
24323,"Lady Molly was delighted with her guest, admiring his appearance, his fine, courtly manners, and falling an easy victim to his charm.",f
24324,"O'Hara, watching them, saw with content that his capricious little wife was really attracted to my lord.",f
24325,"It was a high honour, for she was hard to please, and many of O'Hara's acquaintances had been received, if not with actual coldness, at least not with any degree of warmth.",f
24326,"At the end of the meal she withdrew with the warning that they were not to sit too long over their wine, and that Miles was not to fatigue his lordship.",f
24327,O'Hara pushed the decanter towards his friend.,f
24328,"""I've a piece of news I daresay will interest ye!"" he remarked.",f
24329,Carstares looked at him inquiringly.,f
24330,"""Ay.",f
24331,"'Tis that his Grace of Andover has withdrawn his precious person to Paris.""",f

24339,"Damn him!""",f

24343,"""He has interfered with me best friend to some purpose.""",f
24344,"""I fear the boot was on the other leg!""",f

24447,CHAPTER XVI  MR. BETTISON PROPOSES   Mr. Bettison could make nothing of Diana of late.,f
24448,"Her demeanour, at first so charming and so cheerful, had become listless, and even chilling.",f
24449,"She seemed hardly to listen to some of his best tales, and twice she actually forgot to laugh at what was surely a most witty pleasantry.",f
24450,"It struck him that she regarded him with a resentful eye, as if she objected to his presence at Horton House, and had no desire to be courted.",f
24451,"But Mr. Bettison was far too egotistic to believe such a thing, and he brushed the incredible suspicion away, deciding that her coldness was due to a very proper shyness.",f
24452,He continued his visits until they became so frequent that scarce a day passed without his strutting step being heard approaching the house and his voice inquiring for the Miss Beauleighs.,f
24453,"Mr. Beauleigh, who secretly hoped for Mr. Bettison as a son-in-law, would not permit the ladies to deny themselves, and he further counselled Miss Betty to absent herself after the first few moments, leaving the young couple together.",f
24454,Thus it was that it so continually fell to Diana's lot to receive the Squire and to listen to his never-ending monologues.,f
24455,"She persistently snubbed him, hoping to ward off the impending proposal, but either her snubs were not severe enough, or Mr. Bettison's skin was too thick to feel them; for not a fortnight after my lord's departure, he begged her hand in marriage.",f
24456,"It was refused him with great firmness, but, taking the refusal for coquettishness, he pressed his suit still more amorously, and with such a self-assured air that Mistress Di became indignant.",f
24457,"""Sir,"" she cried, ""it seems you have indeed misread my attitude towards you!""",f
24458,Mr. Bettison was struck dumb with amazement.,f
24459,It had never entered his brain that Diana could seriously refuse him.,f
24460,"He could hardly believe his ears at this quite unmistakable tone of voice, and sat gaping.",f
24461,"""I must beg,"" continued Diana, ""I must beg that you will discontinue your all-too-frequent visits here.",f
24462,"Please do not deem me unkind, but your persecution of me--I can call it nothing else--is wearying--and--you will forgive the word--tiresome.",f
24463,"I confess I am surprised that you had not perceived your attentions to be distasteful to me.""",f
24464,"""Distasteful!"" cried Mr. Bettison, recovering after two or three unsuccessful attempts from his speechlessness.",f
24465,"""Do you mean what you say, Miss Diana?",f
24466,"That you will not wed me?""",f
24467,She nodded.,f
24468,"""Yes, Mr. Bettison, I do.""",f

24990,"In spite of the worry the constant stoppages entailed, he quite enjoyed the journey, for Lavinia was in excellent spirits, and made light of their mishaps, receiving each fresh one with roguish laughter and some witty remark.",f
24991,"Even when the chimney of her bed-chamber, at one of the inns at which they halted, smoked most vilely, she did not, as Richard quite expected she would, fly into a rage and refuse to spend another moment in the house, but after looking extremely doleful, cheered up and told dear Dicky that she would have his room while he should have hers.",f
24992,Then in the morning she would find him all dried up and _smoked_!,f

24994,"The journey was, of necessity, very slow, not only on account of the bad roads, but because whenever my lady caught sight of wild roses growing on the hedges, she must stop to pluck some.",f
24995,"Then she and Richard would stroll along for some way, he leading his horse, the coach following at a walking pace.",f
24996,"All of which was very idyllic, and had the effect of sending Richard to the seventh heaven of content.",f
24997,"When at length they arrived at Wyncham House, Mayfair, they found that the servants had arrived a week before, and had made good use of their time.",f

25009,"Her tippet was gold-laced to match her petticoat, and to fasten it she wore a brooch composed of clustered rubies.",f

25252,"But Lavinia, it appeared, was going to watch the dicing at Richard's table: she vowed she should bring him monstrous good luck.",f

25264,"Even Lavinia joined in the general laugh, not so much at the wit's words as at his comic expression, and the extreme deliberation with which he had enacted the little scene.",f
25265,"Someone cried a bet to Lovelace, which was promptly accepted, and Lavinia's eyes glowed afresh as she followed the Captain to a table.",f
25266,"Richard went to fetch her some refreshment, and on his return, found her leaning over Lovelace's chair, her hand on his shoulder, eagerly casting the dice on to the table.",f

25273,"When she at length ceased, her luck had run out, and she had lost her much-prized ruby earring to Mr. Selwyn, who placed it carefully in his vest pocket, vowing he should wear it next his heart for ever.",f
25274,"Then, and then only, did she consent to leave the gaming tables for the dancing hall, and for another hour Richard had the felicity of watching her tread the minuet with various young bloods, but most often with her new-found Harry Lovelace.",f
25275,"CHAPTER XIX  THE REAPPEARANCE OF HIS GRACE OF ANDOVER   It seemed to Richard in the days that followed, that Captain Lovelace was never out of his house.",f
25276,"If he went to his wife's boudoir, there was Lovelace, hanging over her while she played upon the spinet or glanced through the pages of the _Rambler_.",f
25277,"If Lavinia went to a ball or masquerade, the Captain was always amongst the favoured ones admitted to her chamber for the express purpose of watching her don her gown and judiciously place her patches.",f
25278,"If Carstares begged his wife's company one morning, she was full of regrets: Harry was calling to take her to Vauxhall or to Spring Gardens.",f
25279,"When he entered his door, the first sight that met his eyes was the Captain's amber-clouded cane and point-edged hat; and when he looked out of the window, it was more often to see a chair draw up at the house and Lovelace alight.",f
25280,"After patiently enduring a week of his continued presence, Carstares remonstrated with his wife: she must not encourage her friend to spend all his time at Grosvenor Square.",f
25281,"At first she had looked reproachful, and then she inquired his reason.",f
25282,His reluctant answer was that it was not seemly.,f
25283,"At that her eyes had opened wide, and she demanded to know what could be more seemly than the visits of such an old friend?",f
25284,"With a gleam of humour, Richard replied that it was not Captain Harold's age that he objected to, but, on the contrary, his youth.",f
25285,On which she accused him of being jealous.,f
25286,"It was true enough, but he indignantly repudiated the suggestion.",f
25287,"Very well, then, he was merely stupid!",f
25288,He must not be cross;,f
25289,"Harry was her very good friend, and did not Richard admire the new device for her hair?",f
25290,Richard was not to be cajoled: did she clearly understand that Lovelace's visits must cease?,f
25291,"She only understood one thing, and that was that Dicky was marvellous ill-tempered and ridiculous to-day.",f
25292,And he must not tease her!,f
25293,"Yes, she would be very good, but so must he!",f
25294,"And now she was going shopping, and she would require at least twenty guineas.",f
25295,"In spite of her promise to ""be good,"" she made no attempt to discourage Lovelace's attentions, always smiling charmingly upon him and beckoning him to her side.",f
25296,It was the morning of the Duchess of Devonshire's rout that Carstares again broached the subject.,f
25297,"My lady was in bed, her fair hair unpowdered and streaming all about her shoulders, her chocolate on a small table at her side and countless _billets doux_ from admirers scattered on the sheet.",f
25298,"In her hand she held a bouquet of white roses with a card attached bearing, in bold, sprawling characters, the initials ""H. L.""",f
25299,Perhaps it was the sight of those incriminating letters that roused Richard's anger.,f
25300,"At all events, with a violence quite unlike his usual gentle politeness, he snatched the flowers from her hand, and sent them whizzing into a corner.",f
25301,"""Let there be an end to all this folly!"" he cried.",f

25357,"He stamped out of the room as he spoke, and she sank back amongst her pillows, white and trembling with fury.",f
25358,"As soon as she was dressed, she flounced downstairs, bent on finishing the quarrel.",f
25359,"But Carstares had gone out some time since, and was not expected to return until late.",f
25360,"For a moment Lavinia was furious, but the timely arrival of a box from her mantua-maker's chased away the frowns and wreathed her face in smiles.",f
25361,"Richard did not return until it was time to prepare for the rout, and on entering the house he went straight to his chamber, putting himself into the hands of his valet.",f
25362,"He submitted to the delicate tinting of his finger-nails, the sprinkling of his linen with rosewater and the stencilling of his brows.",f
25363,"He was arrayed in puce and gold, rings slipped on to his fingers, his legs coaxed into hose with marvellous clocks splashed on their sides, and a diamond buckle placed above the large black bow of his tie-wig.",f
25364,"Then, powdered, painted and patched, he went slowly across to his wife's room.",f
25365,"Lavinia, who had by now quite forgotten the morning's _contretemps_, greeted him with a smile.",f
25366,"She sat before the mirror in her under-gown, with a loose _deshabille_ thrown over her shoulders.",f
25367,"The _coiffeur_ had departed, and her hair, thickly powdered, was dressed high above her head over cushions, twisted into curls over her ears and allowed to fall in more curls over her shoulders.",f
25368,"On top of the creation were poised ostrich feathers, scarlet and white, and round her throat gleamed a great necklet of diamonds.",f
25369,"The room was redolent of some heavy perfume; discarded ribbons, laces, slippers and gloves strewed the floor; over the back of a chair hung a brilliant scarlet domino, and tenderly laid out on the bed was her gown, a mass of white satin and brocade, with full ruffles over the hips and quantities of foaming lace falling from the corsage and from the short sleeves.",f
25370,"Beside it reposed her fan, her soft lace gloves, her mask and her tiny reticule.",f

25395,"""Oh, 'tis no matter--I am ready for my gown, Louisa.""",f
25396,"There came more knocking at the door, and this time it was Carstares who rose to open it.",f
25397,"There entered Markham, heavily handsome in crimson and gold, and Lovelace, his opposite, fair and delicately pretty in palest blue and silver.",f
25398,"As usual, he wore his loose wig, and in it sparkled three sapphire pins.",f
25399,He made my lady a marvellous leg.,f
25400,"""I am prostrated by your beauty, fairest!""",f

25407,"Lovelace sat down on a chair, straddle-wise, his arms over the back, and his chin sunk in his hands.",f
25408,Markham leant against the _garde-robe_ and watched through his glass.,f
25409,"When the dress was at last arranged, the suggested improvements in the matter of lace, ribbons, and the adjustment of a brooch thoroughly discussed, bracelets fixed on her arms and the flaming domino draped about her, it was full three-quarters of an hour later, and Carstares was becoming impatient.",f
25410,"It was not in his nature to join with the two men in making fulsome compliments, and their presence at the toilette filled him with annoyance.",f
25411,"He hated that Lavinia should admit them, but it was the _mode_, and he knew he must bow the head under it.",f
25412,"My lady was at last ready to start; her gilded chair awaited her in the light of the _flambeaux_ at the door, and with great difficulty she managed to enter it, taking absurd pains that her silks should not crush, nor the nodding plumes of her huge head-dress become disordered by unseemly contact with the roof.",f
25413,"Then she found that she had left her fan in her room, and Lovelace and Markham must needs vie with one another in the fetching of it.",f
25414,"While they wrangled wittily for the honour, Richard went quietly indoors and presently emerged with the painted chicken-skin, just as Lovelace was preparing to ascend the steps.",f
25415,At last Lavinia was shut in and the bearers picked up the poles.,f
25416,"Off went the little cavalcade down the long square, the chair in the middle.",f
25417,"Lovelace walked close beside it on the right, and Richard and Markham on the left.",f
25418,"So they proceeded through the uneven streets, carefully picking their way through the dirtier parts, passing other chairs and pedestrians, all coming from various quarters into South Audley Street.",f
25419,"They were remarkably silent: Markham from habitual laziness, Lovelace because he sensed Richard's antagonism, and Richard himself on account of his extremely worried state of mind.",f
25420,"In fact, until they reached Curzon Street no one spoke, and then it was only Markham, who, glancing behind him at the shuttered windows of the great corner house, casually remarked that Chesterfield was still at Wells.",f
25421,"An absent assent came from Carstares, and the conversation came to an end.",f
25422,"In Clarges Street they were joined by Sir John Fortescue, an austere patrician, and although some years his senior, a close friend of Richard's.",f

25937,"I do not wish to witness your ruin.""",f
25938,"The tears brimmed over, and she caught his handkerchief from him, dabbing at her eyes with one heavily-laced corner.",f
25939,"""You do love me, Tracy?""",f
25940,"""In the recesses of my mind I believe I cherish some affection for you,"" he replied coolly, rescuing his handkerchief.",f
25941,"""I used to class you with your deplorable brothers, but I think perhaps I was wrong.""",f

25945,To her surprise he flushed a little.,f

25947,"Once outside in the square he looked for a sedan, and not seeing one, walked away towards Audley Street.",f
25948,"He went quickly, but his progress was somewhat retarded by two ladies, who, passing in their chairs down the street, perceived him and beckoned him to their sides.",f
25949,"Escaping presently from them, he turned into Curzon Street, and from thence down Half Moon Street, where he literally fell into the arms of Tom Wilding, who had much to say on the subject of March's last bet with Edgecumbe.",f
25950,"His Grace affected interest, politely declined Wilding's proffered escort, and hurried down into Piccadilly, walking eastwards towards St.",f
25951,"James's Square, where was the Andover town house.",f

25954,He had no idea that Belmanoir had returned from Paris.,f
25955,A week ago he had arrived?,f
25956,"Well, he, Walpole, had been out of town all the week--at Twickenham.",f
25957,He hoped Bel. would honour him with his company at the small card-party he was giving there on Thursday.,f
25958,"George was coming, and Dick Edgecumbe; he had asked March and Gilly Williams, but the Lord knew whether both would be induced to appear!",f
25959,Bel. had heard of Gilly's absurd jealousy?,f
25960,"Wilding was promised, and Markham; several other answers he was awaiting.",f
25961,Andover accepted gracefully and parted from Mr. Walpole.,f
25962,"He made the rest of his journey in peace, and on arriving at his house, went straight to the library, where sat a sleek, eminently respectable-looking individual, dressed like a groom.",f

25993,"""Repeat what I have said, then.""",f
25994,Harper stumbled through it and mopped his brow unhappily.,f

25998,Harper brightened considerably.,f
25999,"""Yes, your Grace!",f
26000,"Thank you, sir!""",f
26001,Tracy laid twenty guineas before him.,f
26002,"""That is for your expenses.",f
26003,"Remember this: the sooner the thing is done, the more certain are your fifty guineas.",f
26004,That is all.,f
26005,"Have you any questions to ask?""",f
26006,"Harper cudgelled his still dazed brain, and finding none, shook his head.",f
26007,"""No, your Grace.""",f
26008,"""Then you may go.""",f
26009,"The man bowed himself out, clutching his guineas.",f
26010,"He was comparatively a newcomer in his Grace's service, and he was by no means accustomed to the Duke's lightning method of conducting his affairs.",f
26011,He was not sure that he quite appreciated it.,f
26012,But fifty guineas were fifty guineas.,f
26013,"CHAPTER XXI  MRS. FANSHAWE LIGHTS A FIRE AND O'HARA FANS THE FLAME   Richard Carstares very soon availed himself of Mrs. Fanshawe's permission to call upon her, and duly put in an appearance at No. 16, Mount Street.",f

26016,"Seeing that he would have no opportunity to talk with the widow on the subject of his brother, he very soon took his leave, promising to wait upon her again at no very distant date.",f
26017,"When, three days later, he again sent in his name and was admitted, he found the lady alone, and was gratified to hear her order the servant to deny her to all other visitors.",f

26030,"""Of course.",f
26031,"I will tell you all I know, Mr. Carstares, but it is not very much, and maybe you will be disappointed.",f
26032,"But I only knew him the short time we were both in Vienna, and--he was not very communicative.""",f

26034,"""No. If one attempted to draw his confidence, he became a polite iceberg.""",f
26035,"""Nevertheless, madam, please tell me all that you know.""",f

26041,"He induced Sir Anthony to continue his walk with us, and afterwards he called at our lodgings.",f
26042,"I think he, too, was glad to meet a fellow-countryman, for he came often, and once when I had been talking with him for some time he let fall--what shall I say?--his reserve--his guard--and told me that he had scarcely spoken his own language for four years.",f
26043,"Afterwards he seemed to regret having said even that much, and turned the subject.""",f
26044,She paused and looked up to see if her auditor was interested.,f

26046,"""And then?""",f
26047,"""I do not remember.",f
26048,"He came, as I said, often, mostly to talk to my husband, who was a great invalid, but sometimes to see me.",f
26049,He would hardly ever speak of England--I think he did not trust himself.,f
26050,"He never mentioned any relations or any English friends, and when I spoke of home, he would shut his mouth very tightly, and look terribly sad.",f
26051,"I saw that for some reason the subject pained him, so I never spoke of it if I could help it.",f
26052,"""He was a most entertaining companion, Mr. Carstares; he used to tell my husband tales that made him laugh as I had not heard him laugh for months.",f
26053,"He was very lively, very witty, and almost finickingly well dressed, but what his occupation was I could not quite ascertain.",f
26054,"He said he was a gentleman of leisure, but I do not think he was at all wealthy.",f
26055,"He frequented all the gaming houses, and I heard tales of his marvellous luck, so one day I taxed him with it, and he laughed and said he lived by Chance--he meant dice.",f
26056,"Yet I know, for I once had conversation with his servant, that his purse was at times very, very slender.""",f
26057,"""The time he aided you, Mrs. Fanshawe, when was that?""",f
26058,She flushed.,f
26059,"""That was a few months after we first met him.",f

26066,"But I--well, sir, I have told you, I was young and very foolish--I would not listen.",f
26067,"When he called at our house and found that I was out, he at once guessed where I had gone, and he followed me to the Count's house, gave an Austrian name, and was announced just as the Count tried to--tried to--kiss me.",f
26068,I think I shall never forget the relief of that moment!,f
26069,"He was so safe, and so English!",f
26070,"The Count was furious, and at first I thought he would have his lackeys throw Anthony out.",f
26071,"But when he heard all that Anthony had to say, he realised that it was useless to try to detain me--and I was taken home.",f

26073,"Two days after, he and the Count fought a duel, and the Count was wounded in the lung.",f

26130,Time after time had he argued this question with himself: John or Lavinia? ...,f
26131,"He fell to wondering where his brother now was; whether he was still roaming the South Country, a highwayman.",f
26132,"No one would ever know how he, Richard, dreaded each fresh capture made by the military.",f
26133,"Every time he expected John to be among the prisoners, and he visited Newgate so often that his friends twitted him on it, vowing he had Selwyn's love of horrors.",f
26134,"He would argue that the matter rested in John's own hands: if he were minded to come back to society, he would do so; but deep within himself he knew that such a decision was unworthy of one even so debased as was he.",f
26135,"Then his mind went to Lavinia, who alternately enchanted and exasperated him.",f
26136,"Only a week ago she had defied him openly in the matter of her friendship with Lovelace, yet had she not afterwards apologised, and thrust the Captain aside for his sake?",f
26137,"She was so sweetly naughty, so childishly unreasonable.",f
26138,Selfish?,f
26139,"Yes, he supposed so, but he loved her!--loved her so greatly that it were a pleasure to him to die for her sake.",f
26140,"Yet John--John was his brother--the adored elder brother, and by obeying Lavinia he was wronging him, hurting him.",f
26141,If only Lavinia would consent to the truth being told!,f
26142,It always came back to that point: if only she would consent.,f
26143,And she never would.,f
26144,"She insisted that, having married her under false pretences, he had no right to disgrace her now.",f
26145,"She was right, he knew, but he wished she could be for once unselfish.",f
26146,"So he worried on through the night, tossing to and fro in his great bed, a weight on his mind, a ceaseless ache in his heart.",f
26147,Towards dawn he fell asleep and did not wake again until his chocolate was brought to him.,f
26148,"Bitterly he reflected that at least John had no conscience to prey upon him; he did not fall asleep with his brain seething with conflicting arguments, and awake with the decision as far off as ever.",f
26149,"To-day his head ached unbearably, and he stayed in bed for some time contemplating the grey morning.",f
26150,"A fog hung over the Square, and through it the trees, with their withered autumn leaves, loomed dismally before the windows.",f
26151,"There was something infinitely depressing about the dull outlook, and presently he rose and allowed his valet to dress him, not able to stand the inaction any longer.",f
26152,"His headache was better by the time he had visited his wife in her room, and listened to her enthusiastic account of last night's rout, and, going out into the square, he called a chair, ordering the men to carry him to White's, where he intended to write two letters.",f
26153,"Somehow, Wyncham House was too poignantly full of memories of John to-day, and he was thankful to be out of it.",f
26154,"White's was crowded even at that hour of the morning, and the noise seemed to cut through his head.",f
26155,"Men hailed him from all sides, offering him bets; someone tried to tell him some piece of scandal; they would not let him alone, and at last his jagged nerves would no longer support it, and he left the house to go further down the street to his other club, the Cocoa-Tree, which he hoped to find less rowdy.",f
26156,"It was fuller than he expected, but many of the men had come as he had, to write letters and to be quiet.",f
26157,Very little gaming was as yet in swing.,f
26158,"Richard wrote steadily for perhaps an hour, and sealed his last letter preparatory to leaving.",f
26159,"As he affixed the wafer, he was conscious of a stir behind him, and heard exclamations of:  ""Where in thunder did you spring from?""",f
26160,"""Gad, 'tis an age since I've seen you!""",f
26161,"""Lord, 'tis O'Hara!""",f
26162,"Then came the soft Irish voice in answer, and he slewed round in his chair to face them all.",f
26163,"Miles O'Hara was the centre of a little group of interested and welcoming clubmen, explaining his arrival.",f
26164,"""Sure, I was in town on a matter of business, and I thought I must come to the club to see ye all while I was here, for 'tis not often I get the chance--""  Richard rose, gathering up his letters and stared across at this man who had been Jack's greatest friend.",f
26165,He took a step towards him.,f
26166,"As he did so, O'Hara turned and caught sight of him.",f
26167,"Richard was about to hail him, when he suddenly noticed the change in his expression.",f
26168,The good humour died out of the Irishman's eyes and left them hard and scornful.,f
26169,His pleasant mouth curved into a disdainful line.,f
26170,"Carstares stood still, one hand on the back of a chair, his eyes rivetted to O'Hara's face, reading all the reproach, the red-hot anger that Miles was trying to convey to him.",f
26171,"O'Hara achieved a sneer and turned his shoulder, continuing to address his friends.",f
26172,Richard's head swam.,f
26173,"O'Hara was ignoring him, would not speak to him....",f
26174,O'Hara knew the truth!,f
26175,"He walked blindly to the door, and groped for the handle....",f
26176,O'Hara knew!,f
26177,"He was in the passage, on the front steps, in the road, shuddering.",f
26178,"O'Hara knew, and he had looked at him as if--as if--again he shuddered, and seeing an empty chair, hailed it, bidding the men carry him to Grosvenor Square....",f
26179,O'Hara despised him!--reproached him!,f
26180,Then Jack was in trouble?,f
26181,He had seen him and learnt the truth?,f
26182,"God, but his brain was reeling! ...",f
26183,"CHAPTER XXII  DEVELOPMENTS   After the encounter with O'Hara, whatever peace of mind Richard had had, left him.",f
26184,"He knew not a moment's quiet; all day, and sometimes all night, his brain worried round and round the everlasting question: John or Lavinia?",f
26185,"He had quite decided that it must be either the one or the other; the idea that he might conceivably retain his wife _and_ confess the truth, never occurred to him.",f
26186,"So often had Lavinia assured him that he had no right to expect her to share his disgrace, that now he believed it.",f
26187,"He thought that she would elope with Lovelace, whom, his tortured mind decided, she really loved.",f
26188,"Any attempt to frustrate such an action would, he supposed wretchedly, be the essence of selfishness.",f
26189,"Of course he was not himself, and his brain was not working normally or rationally; had he but known it, he was mentally ill, and if Lavinia had thought to examine him closely she could not have failed to observe the fever spots on each cheek, the unnaturally bright eyes and the dark rings encircling them.",f
26190,"Richard wore the look of one goaded beyond endurance, and utterly tired and overwrought.",f
26191,"As he told Mrs. Fanshawe, when she exclaimed at his appearance--he could not rest; he must always be moving, thinking.",f
26192,"She saw that he was not entirely himself, and counselled him to consult a doctor.",f
26193,"His half-angry repudiation of all illness did not surprise her, but she was considerably startled when, in answer to her pleading that he should have a care for himself, he vehemently said: ""If I could die, I should be glad!""",f
26194,"She wondered what his wife was about not to see his condition, and wished that she might do something.",f
26195,"But she was not acquainted with Lady Lavinia, and she felt it would be a piece of gross presumption on her part to speak to her of Richard.",f
26196,"If she had thought his malady to be physical, she reflected, she might venture a word, but as she perceived it to be mental, she could only hope that it would pass in time, and that he would recover from his run-down condition.",f
26197,"Lady Lavinia was pursuing her butterfly existence, heeding nothing but her own pleasure, bent on enjoying herself.",f
26198,"She succeeded very well, on the whole, but she could not help wishing that Dicky were a little more cheerful and wishful to join in her gaiety.",f
26199,"Of late he was worse than ever, and although he supplied her wants uncomplainingly, she would almost rather he had refused her and shown a little life, than give way to her with this dreadful apathy.",f
26200,"Lovelace was out of town for a week, and Lavinia was surprised to find how little she missed him.",f
26201,"To be sure, playing with fire was very pleasant, but when it was removed out of her reach, it really made no odds.",f
26202,"She missed Harry's adulation and his passionate love-making, for she was one of those women who must always have admiration and excitement, but she was not made miserable by his absence.",f
26203,"She continued to flutter round to all the entertainments of the season with one or other of her brothers, and when Lovelace returned he was disturbed by her casual welcome.",f
26204,"However, she was undoubtedly pleased to see him, and soon fell more or less under his spell, allowing him to be by her side when Tracy was not near, and to charm her ears with compliments and gallantry.",f
26205,"To do him justice, Captain Harold was really in love with her and was quite ready to relinquish his commission if only she would run away with him.",f
26206,"He had private means of his own, and promised her that her every whim should be satisfied.",f
26207,But Lavinia scolded him and shook her head.,f
26208,"Apart from any ulterior consideration, Richard was, after all, her husband; he, too, loved her, and she was very, very fond of him, although she did plague him dreadfully.",f
26209,"Lovelace assured her that her husband did not love her nearly as much as he, and when she smiled her disbelief, lost his temper and cried that all the town knew Carstares to be at Mrs. Fanshawe's feet!",f
26210,Lavinia stiffened.,f
26211,"""Harold!""",f
26212,"""I am only surprised that you have been blind to it,"" he continued.",f
26213,"""Where do you think he goes every day for so long?",f
26214,White's?,f
26215,"No. To 16, Mount Street!",f
26216,Stapely called there and met him; another day Lady Davenant saw him with her;,f
26217,Wilding has also met him at her house.,f
26218,"He spends nearly every afternoon with her!""",f
26219,"Lavinia was a Belmanoir, and she had all the Belmanoir pride.",f
26220,Rising to her feet she drew her cloak about her with her most queenly air.,f
26221,"""You forget yourself, Harold,"" she said haughtily.",f
26222,"""Never dare to speak to me of my husband again in that tone!",f
26223,"You may take me at once to my brother.""",f
26224,"He was very penitent, wording his apology most cleverly, smoothing her ruffled plumage, withdrawing his words, but at the same time contriving to leave their sting behind.",f
26225,"She forgave him, yes, but he must never offend her so again.",f
26226,"Although she had indignantly refused to believe the scandal, it nevertheless rankled, and she found herself watching her husband with jealous eyes, noticing his seeming indifference towards her and his many absences from home.",f
26227,Then came a day when she caused her chair to be borne down Mount Street at the very moment when Richard was coming out of No. 16.,f
26228,That was enough for Lavinia.,f
26229,So he was indeed tired of her!,f
26230,He loved another woman!--some wretched widow!,f
26231,For the first time a real worry plagued her.,f
26232,She stayed at home that evening and exerted all her arts to captivate her husband.,f
26233,"But Richard, seeing John unhappy, reproachful, every way he turned, his head on fire, his brain seething with conflicting arguments, hardly noticed her, and as soon as he might politely do so, left her, to pace up and down the library floor, trying to make up his mind what to do.",f
26234,Lady Lavinia was stricken with horror.,f
26235,"She had sickened him by her megrims, as Tracy had prophesied she would!",f
26236,He no longer cared for her!,f
26237,_This_ was why he continually excused himself from accompanying her when she went out!,f
26238,"For once in her life she faced facts, and the prospect alarmed her.",f
26239,"If it was not already too late, she must try to win back his love, and to do this she realised she must cease to tease him for money, and also cease to snap at him whenever she felt at all out of sorts.",f
26240,She must charm him back to her.,f
26241,She had no idea how much she cared for him until now that she thought he did not care for her.,f
26242,It was dreadful: she had always been so sure of Dicky!,f
26243,"Whatever she did, however exasperating she might be, he would always adore her.",f
26244,"And all the time, Richard, far from making love to Mrs. Fanshawe, was hearing anecdotes of his brother from her, little details of his appearance, things he had said.",f
26245,"He drank in all the information, clutching eagerly at each fresh scrap of gossip, greedy to hear it if it in any way concerned John.",f
26246,"His brain was absorbed with this one subject, and he never saw when Lavinia smiled upon him, nor did he seem to hear her coaxing speeches.",f
26247,"When she remarked, as she presently did, on his pallor, he almost snapped at her, and left the room.",f
26248,"Once she put her arms about him and kissed him on the lips; he put her gently aside, too worried to respond to the caress, but, had she known it--grateful for it.",f
26249,"His Grace of Andover meeting his sister at Ranelagh Gardens, thought her face looked pinched, and her eyes unhappy.",f
26250,"He inquired the reason, but Lady Lavinia refused to confide even in him, and pleaded a headache.",f
26251,"Andover, knowing her, imagined that she had been refused some kickshaw, and thought no more about it.",f
26252,He himself was very busy.,f
26253,Only two days before a groom had presented himself at St.,f
26254,"James's Square, bearing a missive from Harper, very illegible and ill-spelt, but to the point:  ""YR.",f
26255,"GRACE,  ""I have took the liberty of engageing this Man, Douglas, in Yr.",f

26262,"He was amused at the blind way in which the man had walked into his trap, and meditated cynically on the frailty of human nature, which will always follow the great god Mammon.",f
26263,"Not three days later came another letter, this time from Mr. Beauleigh, addressed to him at White's, under the name of Sir Hugh Grandison.",f
26264,It asked for the man Harper's character.,f
26265,"His Grace of Andover answered it in the library of his own home, and smiled sarcastically as he wrote Harper down ""exceeding honest and trustworthy, as I have always found.""",f
26266,He was in the middle of the letter when the door was unceremoniously pushed open and Andrew lounged into the room.,f
26267,His Grace looked up frowning.,f
26268,"Not a whit dismayed by the coolness of his reception, his brother kicked the door to and lowered his long limbs into a chair.",f
26269,"""May I ask to what I owe the honour of this intrusion?"" smiled Tracy dangerously.",f

26272,"But I think you'll be interested in this, 'tis so vastly mysterious.""",f

26274,"What is the matter?""",f
26275,"""Just what I want to know!""",f

26282,"God ha' mercy!""",f
26283,The young rake stretched his legs out before him and cast his eyes down their shapeliness.,f
26284,"Then he stiffened and sat up, staring at one white-stockinged ankle.",f
26285,"""Now, damn and curse it! where did that come from?"" he expostulated mildly.",f
26286,"""Where did _what_ come from?""",f
26287,"""That great splash of mud on my leg.",f
26288,"Brand new on this morning, and I've scarce set my nose without doors.",f

26296,Think of it! ...,f
26297,"Well, the point--there is one, you see--is this: it is Richard's desire that you honour him with your presence at Wyncham on Friday week, at three in the afternoon exactly.",f
26298,"To which effect he sends you this.""",f
26299,He tossed a letter on to the desk.,f
26300,"""You are like to have the felicity of meeting me there.""",f
26301,Tracy ripped open the packet and spread the single sheet on the desk before him.,f
26302,"He read it through very deliberately, turned it over, as if in search of more, re-read it, folded it, and dropped it into the wastebasket at his side.",f
26303,He then picked up his quill and dipped it in the ink again.,f

26484,"When she had no more tears to shed, she sat up and tried to think that she wanted to elope.",f
26485,"Harold would be very good to her, she was sure, and she would doubtless lead a very exciting life, but--somehow the more she thought of it, the less she wanted to elope.",f
26486,"Then she remembered that Dicky--why had she never realised how much she cared for him?--was in love with some horrid widow, and did not want her to remain with him.",f

26496,"CHAPTER XXIII  LADY LAVINIA GOES TO THE PLAY   Richard was away from home all next day, and his wife had plenty of time in which to meditate upon her situation.",f
26497,"She had quite come to the conclusion that she must elope with Lovelace, and was only waiting for to-night to tell him so.",f
26498,"She would never, never ask Richard to let her stay with him now that she knew he loved another.",f
26499,Truly a most trying predicament.,f
26500,The Carstares were going to-night to Drury Lane to see Garrick play one of his most successful comedies: the _Beaux' Stratagem_.,f
26501,"The _monde_ that would flock to see the inimitable Archer was likely to be a very distinguished one, especially as the cast held the added attraction of Mrs. Clive, and ordinarily Lady Lavinia would have looked forward with much excitement to seeing the piece.",f
26502,"To-day, however, she felt that she would far rather go to bed and cry.",f
26503,"But Lovelace had to be answered, and besides that, she had invited two cousins, new come from Scotland, to accompany her, and she could not fail them.",f
26504,"So that evening saw her seated in her box, wonderfully gowned as usual, scanning the house.",f
26505,"Behind her stood her husband--when she thought that this was the last time she would ever go with him to the theatre she had much ado to keep from bursting into tears before them all--and in the chair at her side was the cousin, Mrs. Fleming.",f
26506,"Mr. Fleming stood with his hands behind his back, exclaiming every now and then as his kinsman, young Charles Holt, pointed out each newcomer of note.",f
26507,"He was a short, tubby little man, dressed in sober brown, very neat as regards his wrists and neckband, but attired, so thought Lavinia, for the country, and not for town.",f
26508,"His dark suit contrasted strangely with Mr. Holt's rather garish mixture of apple-green and pink, with waistcoat of yellow, and Richard's quieter, but far more handsome apricot and silver.",f
26509,"His wig, too, was not at all modish, being of the scratch type that country gentlemen affected.",f
26510,"His wife was the reverse of smart, but she was loud in her admiration of her more affluent cousin's stiff silks and laces.",f
26511,"She had married beneath her, had Mrs. Fleming, and the Belmanoirs had never quite forgiven the shocking _mesalliance_.",f
26512,"William Fleming was nought but a simple Scotsman, whose father--even now the family shuddered at the thought--had been a farmer!",f
26513,"Lavinia was not over-pleased that they should have elected to visit London, and still less pleased that they should evince such an affection for the Hon.",f
26514,Richard and his wife.,f
26515,"""Well, to be sure, Lavvy, 'tis pleasant to sit here and admire all the people!"" exclaimed Mrs. Fleming, for perhaps the twentieth time.",f
26516,"""I declare I am grown positively old-fashioned from having lived for so long in the country!--yes, my dear, positively old-fashioned! ...",f
26517,I cannot but marvel at the great hoops everyone is wearing!,f
26518,"I am sure mine is not half the size of yours, and the lady down there in the stage-box has one even larger!""",f
26519,Lavinia directed her gaze towards the box in question.,f
26520,"At any other time she would have been annoyed to see that the occupant was Lady Carlyle, her pet rival in all matters of fashion.",f
26521,"Now she felt that nothing signified, and merely remarked that she considered those absurd garlands of roses on the dress quite grotesque.",f
26522,"Behind, Holt was directing Mr. Fleming's attention to a box at the back of the house.",f
26523,"""'Pon my soul, William!",f
26524,"'Tis the Duchess of Queensberry and her son--March, you know.",f
26525,I assure you there is no one more amiable in town.,f
26526,"When I last visited her--""  ""Charles knows well-nigh everyone here,"" remarked Mrs. Fleming ingenuously, and wondered why her cousin laughed.",f
26527,"When the curtain rose on the first act, Lovelace was nowhere to be seen, and Lavinia tried to interest herself in the play.",f
26528,But it is difficult to be interested in anything when one's whole mind is occupied with something else far more overwhelming.,f
26529,She was not the only one of the party that Garrick failed to amuse.,f
26530,"Richard sat wretchedly in the shadow of the box, thinking how, in a short while, he would never again conduct his wife to the theatre and never again sit at her side watching her every change of expression.",f
26531,"In the first interval Lovelace had still not arrived, but many other acquaintances had arrived and called to see the Carstares.",f
26532,"Markham, Wilding, Devereux, Sir John Fortescue--all came into the box at different times, paid homage to Lavinia, were introduced to Mrs. Fleming, laughed and cracked jokes with the men, and drifted away again.",f
26533,How was it she had never before realised how much she enjoyed her life? wondered Lavinia.,f
26534,"She settled down to listen to the second act, and Garrick's skill caught her interest and held it.",f
26535,"For a moment she forgot her woes and clapped as heartily as anyone, laughing as gaily.",f
26536,"The next instant she remembered again, and sank back into unutterable gloom.",f
26537,"But Richard had heard her merry laugh, and his heart was even gloomier than hers.",f
26538,There was no help for it: Lavinia was delighted at the thought of leaving him.,f
26539,"As the curtain fell, Mrs. Fleming suddenly demanded if it was not Tracy seated in the box over on the other side.",f
26540,Lavinia turned to look.,f
26541,"In the box, alone, sat his Grace, seemingly unaware of her presence.",f
26542,"""Is it not Tracy?"" persisted Mrs. Fleming.",f
26543,"""I remember his face so well.""",f
26544,"""Yes,"" nodded Lavinia, and waved to him.",f
26545,"Andover rose, bowed, and left his box.",f
26546,"In a few moments he was in their own, kissing his cousin's hand.",f
26547,Lavinia now caught sight of Lovelace standing on the floor of the theatre looking up at her.,f
26548,"He, too, disappeared from view, and she guessed that he was coming to speak with her.",f
26549,"He had evidently failed to perceive the Duke, who was just a little behind her in the shadow.",f
26550,"Richard and Mr. Fleming had left the box, and only Charles Holt remained, engaging Mrs. Fleming's whole attention.",f
26551,If only Tracy would go!,f
26552,How was she ever to give Lovelace her answer with him sitting there so provokingly.,f
26553,Captain Lovelace knocked at the door.,f
26554,"Carelessly she bade him enter, and affected surprise on seeing him.",f
26555,"His Grace looked at her through narrowed lids, and shot a swift glance at Lovelace, whose discomfiture at finding him there was palpable.",f
26556,"Not a trace of emotion was visible on that impassive countenance, but Lavinia felt her brother's attitude to be sinister, as if he divined her wishes and was determined to frustrate them.",f
26557,She watched him smile on Lovelace and beg him to be seated.,f
26558,"Whether by accident or design, she was not sure which, he had so placed the chairs that he himself was between her and the captain.",f
26559,"Skilfully he drew Mrs. Fleming into the conversation, and rearranged his stage.",f
26560,"Lavinia found herself listening to the amiable Mr. Holt, and out of the tail of her eye observed that Lovelace had fallen a victim to her cousin.",f
26561,"She could find no way of speaking to him, and dared not even signal, so adroitly was his Grace stage-managing the scene.",f
26562,Lavinia was now quite certain that he was managing it.,f
26563,"Somehow he had guessed that she had arranged to speak to Lovelace to-night, and was determined to prevent her.",f
26564,"How he had found out, she could not imagine, but she was too well acquainted with him to be surprised.",f
26565,He would never let her disgrace herself if he could help it--she knew that.,f
26566,"In whatever manner he himself might behave, his sister's conduct must be above reproach; he would find some means of separating them until he could cause Lovelace to be removed.",f
26567,"She did not in the least know how he would contrive to do this, but she never doubted that he could and would.",f
26568,"And then she would have to stay with Richard--Richard, who did not want her.",f
26569,If only Tracy would go!,f
26570,Ah! he was rising!,f
26571,His Grace of Andover begged Captain Lovelace to bear him company in his box.,f
26572,He would brook no refusal.,f
26573,He bore his captive off in triumph.,f
26574,A minute later Mr. Fleming re-entered the box.,f
26575,"The third act had just begun when Richard re-appeared, and softly took his seat.",f
26576,On went the play.,f
26577,"Neither Tracy nor Lovelace came to the box during the next interval, and from her point of vantage Lavinia could see that Andrew had been introduced to the latter.",f
26578,She could guess how cleverly his Grace was keeping the Captain by him....,f
26579,"Lord Avon, who had only a week ago returned from Bath, came to pay his respects.",f
26580,He had much to tell dear Lady Lavinia.,f
26581,"How Cholmondely and Falmouth had dared to fight a duel in Crescent Fields, and had been arrested.",f
26582,"How furious the Beau was, but how his age was beginning to tell on him, and how it was whispered that his power was waning.",f
26583,"All of which at any ordinary time would have interested my lady quite prodigiously, but now bored and even annoyed her.",f
26584,On went the play.,f
26585,Scrub and Boniface kept the house in a roar; all but Richard and his wife were enthralled.,f
26586,The incomparable Kitty failed to hold Lavinia's attention.,f
26587,Would Lovelace manage to speak to her in the last interval?,f
26588,"A solicitous enquiry from Mrs. Fleming roused her, and she had perforce to smile--to own to a slight headache, and to evince some interest in the play.",f
26589,One more interval: would he come?,f
26590,She became aware of a hand laid on her shoulder.,f
26591,"Richard's voice, gravely courteous, sounded in her ears.",f
26592,"""You are heated, my dear.",f
26593,"Will you walk outside a little?""",f
26594,"She felt a mad desire to cling to his hand, and suppressed it forcibly.",f
26595,"She rose, hesitating.",f
26596,Mrs. Fleming decided the point.,f
26597,"""The very thing.",f
26598,"How considerate of you, Mr. Carstares!",f
26599,"I shall like to walk amongst all the people, to be sure!",f
26600,"Here is Charles offering to escort us, too!",f
26601,"What say you, Lavvy?""",f
26602,"""I--oh, I shall be pleased to do what suits you best, cousin,"" she answered.",f
26603,"""Then let us go, my love.",f
26604,"Charles has an arm for each, so we may leave our husbands to chat.""",f
26605,They went out into the broad passage and walked towards the foyer.,f
26606,"There Lord March espied Lavinia, who was always a favourite with him, and came forward, offering his arm.",f
26607,"Lavinia took it, thankful to escape from Mr. Holt's vapid conversation.",f
26608,"She let March conduct her to where his mother was sitting, with Mr. Selwyn at her elbow.",f
26609,"Someone fetched her a glass of ratafie, and Montagu came to talk to her.",f
26610,"Stepping out of his box, Richard fell into the arms of his Grace of Andover.",f
26611,"""Ah!",f
26612,"Dick!""",f
26613,Richard eyed him coldly.,f
26614,"""You wanted me?""",f
26615,"Tracy saw Mr. Fleming approaching  ""Only to ask if I may return with you to Grosvenor Square.",f
26616,"I have something important to say.""",f
26617,"""Certainly,"" bowed Richard, and turned aside.",f
26618,"Lovelace, who had succeeded in escaping from the Belmanoir claws, hurried in search of Lavinia.",f
26619,"Not finding her in her box, he gathered she must be in the foyer and made his way towards it.",f
26620,As soon as she saw him coming she set down her glass and rose to her feet.,f
26621,"""Oh, Captain Lovelace!",f
26622,Have you come to fetch me back to my seat?,f
26623,I have scarce set eyes on you this evening.,f
26624,"No, Markham, you may _not_ come!",f
26625,"No, nor you, my lord!",f
26626,"Madam--"" She curtsied low to the old Duchess and walked away on Harold's arm.",f
26627,"When they were once in the deserted passage behind the boxes, he turned eagerly towards her.",f
26628,"""Well, my dearest?",f
26629,"Well?""",f
26630,Lady Lavinia's mouth drooped miserably.,f
26631,"""Yes,"" she said, ""I shall have to come with you.""",f
26632,"The tone was damping, to say the least of it, but he did not seem to notice it.",f
26633,"""Lavinia!",f
26634,"You mean it?""",f
26635,"""Yes,"" she assented, still more dejectedly.",f
26636,"""My beautiful love!",f
26637,You will really come?,f
26638,When?,f
26639,"At once?""",f
26640,"""At--Oh, no, no!""",f
26641,"""Darling, the sooner the better.",f
26642,"I understand 'tis a great step to expect you to take in a hurry, but I assure you 'tis wisest.",f
26643,"Can you come to-morrow?""",f
26644,Her big eyes dilated.,f
26645,"""No!",f
26646,No!,f
26647,"I--oh, I cannot leave Dicky so soon!""",f
26648,She ended with a sob.,f
26649,"""But, Lavinia, my dearest!",f
26650,"You surely do not want to _stay_ with him?"" he cried.",f
26651,"""Yes I do!"" she answered.",f
26652,"""I--I don't want ever to leave him!""",f
26653,This blighting speech left him gasping.,f
26654,"""You--but--heavens! what are you saying?",f
26655,"You love _me_!""",f
26656,"""No, I don't!"" she contradicted.",f
26657,"""I always s-said I d-didn't.",f
26658,"I love my husband!""",f
26659,"""You are distraught!"" he exclaimed.",f
26660,"""If you love him, why do you consent to elope with me?""",f
26661,She looked at him reproachfully.,f
26662,"""There is no one else,"" she said mournfully.",f
26663,"""Good Lord!",f
26664,"What--""  ""I have to elope with someone--because--Dick--d-doesn't love me any more--you see.",f
26665,"I will come with you, and I will try to be good.""",f
26666,"He kissed her hand quickly  ""Sweetheart! ...",f
26667,I still think you are not yourself.,f
26668,"You will think differently to-morrow--you do not really love Carstares.""",f
26669,"She shut her mouth obstinately, tilting her regal little head.",f
26670,He watched her anxiously.,f
26671,"""If you really do love him, 'tis ridiculous to elope with me,"" he said.",f
26672,Her fingers tightened on his wrist.,f
26673,"""But I must!",f
26674,"You don't understand, Harry!",f
26675,You _must_ take me!,f
26676,"Don't you want me?""",f
26677,"""Of course I do, but not if you are longing to be somewhere else all the time.",f
26678,"The whole thing seems preposterous!""",f
26679,"""'Tis all dreadful!--dreadful!",f
26680,I have never been so unhappy in my life!,f
26681,"I--oh, I wish I had not been so heedless and selfish!""",f
26682,"Lovelace pondered for a moment, as they stood outside her box; then, seeing that people were returning to their seats, he opened the door and took her in.",f
26683,"""Listen, dear!",f
26684,"This is the maddest scheme ever I heard; but if you are determined, you shall carry it through.",f
26685,Come to my lodgings to-morrow evening!,f
26686,Bring as little baggage as possible;,f
26687,"I will have all ready, and we will post at once to Dover.",f
26688,"Then in time I hope you will forget Richard and come to care for me a little.""",f
26689,"""You are very, very good, Harry!",f
26690,"Yes, I will do just as you say and, oh, I am sorry to put you out like this!",f
26691,"I am nought but a plague to everyone, and I wish I were dead!",f
26692,"You don't really love me, and I shall be a burden!""",f
26693,"""I do indeed love you!"" he assured her, but within himself he could not help wishing that he had not fallen quite so passionately in love with her.",f
26694,"""I'll leave you now, sweet, for your husband will be returning at any moment.""",f
26695,"He kissed her hands lightly ""_A demain_, fairest!""",f
26696,How she sat through the last act Lavinia could never afterwards imagine.,f
26697,She was longing to be at home--so soon to be home no longer--and quiet.,f
26698,Her head ached now as Richard's had ached for weeks.,f
26699,"More than anything did she want to rest it against her husband's shoulder, so temptingly near, and to feel his sheltering arms about her.",f
26700,"But Dick was in love with Isabella Fanshawe, and she must sit straight and stiff in her chair and smile at the proper places.",f
26701,At last the play was ended!,f
26702,"The curtain descended on the bowing Archer, and the house stamped and clapped its appreciation.",f
26703,The curtain rose again--what! not finished yet?,f
26704,"Ah, no! it was but Garrick leading Mrs. Clive forward.",f
26705,Would they never have done?,f
26706,"Mrs. Fleming was standing; she supposed they were going, and got up.",f
26707,Someone put her cloak about her shoulders;,f
26708,Richard--for the last time.,f
26709,"Mr. Holt escorted her to her coach, and put her and her cousin into it.",f
26710,He and Mr. Fleming had their chairs; so only Richard and Tracy went with the ladies.,f
26711,"The Flemings were staying with friends in Brook Street, just off Grosvenor Square, so that when they had put Harriet down, only a few more yards remained to be covered.",f
26712,Lavinia wondered dully why Tracy had elected to come with them.,f
26713,What did he want?,f
26714,Was he going to warn Dick of her intended flight?,f
26715,He little knew the true state of affairs!,f
26716,At the foot of the staircase at Wyncham House she turned to say good-night.,f
26717,"She merely nodded to Tracy, but to Dick she extended her hand.",f
26718,"He took it in his, kissing it, and she noticed how cold were his fingers, how burning hot his lips.",f
26719,"Then he released her, and she went slowly up the stairs to her room.",f
26720,His Grace watched her through his eyeglass.,f
26721,When she was out of sight he turned and surveyed Richard critically.,f
26722,"""If that is the way you kiss a woman, Lavinia has my sympathies,"" he remarked.",f
26723,Richard's lips tightened.,f
26724,He picked up a stand of lighted candles and ushered his Grace into the drawing-room.,f
26725,"""I presume you did not come to tell me that?"" he asked.",f
26726,"""Your presumption is correct, Richard.",f
26727,"I have come to open your eyes.""",f
26728,"""You are too kind.""",f
26729,"His Grace laid his hat on the table, and sat down on the arm of a chair.",f
26730,"""I think perhaps I am.",f
26731,"It may interest you to hear that Lavinia intends to elope with our gallant friend the Captain.""",f
26732,Richard bowed.,f
26733,"""You knew it?""",f
26734,"""Certainly.""",f
26735,Andover looked him over.,f
26736,"""May I ask what steps you are taking to prevent her?""",f
26737,"""None.""",f
26738,His Grace's expression was quite indescribable.,f
26739,"For a moment he was speechless, and then he reverted to heavy sarcasm.",f
26740,"""Pray remember to be at hand--to conduct her to her chair!"" he drawled.",f

26850,"A weight seemed to rest on her chest, hopeless misery was gathered about her head.",f
26851,"She could not bring herself to drink her chocolate, and, feeling that inaction was the worst of all, she very soon crawled out of bed and allowed her maid to dress her.",f
26852,"Then she went with dragging steps to her boudoir, wondering all the time where Richard was and what he was doing.",f
26853,"She seated herself at her window and looked out on to the square, biting the edge of her handkerchief in the effort to keep back her tears.",f

26855,"He, too, left his chocolate untouched, and went presently down to the breakfast table and looked at the red sirloin with a feeling of acute nausea.",f
26856,"He managed to drink a cup of coffee, and immediately afterwards left the room and made his way to his wife's boudoir.",f
26857,"He told himself he was acting weakly, and had far better avoid her, but in the end he gave way to his longing to see her, and knocked on one white panel.",f
26858,Lavinia's heart leapt.,f

26879,"Lavinia turned away, and as she stepped from him something snapped in Richard's brain.",f

26884,"The mists were gone from his mind now, everything was clear.",f
26885,Lavinia should not elope with Lovelace.,f
26886,"In two strides he was at her side, had caught her by the shoulders and swung her to face him.",f
26887,"""You shall not leave me!",f

26895,"When Carstares was able to say anything beyond how he loved her, he demanded if she did not love him?",f
26896,"""Of course I do!"" she cooed.",f
26897,"""I always, always did, only I was so selfish and so careless!""",f
26898,"He carried her to the sofa and sat down with her on his knee, trying to look into her face.",f
26899,"But she had somehow contrived to hide it on his shoulder, and he did not succeed.",f
26900,"""Then you never loved that puppy?"" he asked, amazed.",f
26901,One hand crept up to his other shoulder.,f
26902,"""Oh, Dicky, no!",f
26903,"And--and you--you don't love that horrid Mrs. Fanshawe, do you?""",f

26906,"Great heavens, no!",f
26907,"You never thought that, surely?""",f
26908,"""I did--I did!",f

26910,"""Cold to _you_?",f
26911,"My dearest, surely not?""",f
26912,"""You were--you truly were--and I was so miserable--I--I thought I had been so unreasonable and so horrid that you had ceased to I-love me--and I did not know what to do.",f

26914,He patted her shoulder comfortingly.,f
26915,"""Sweetheart, don't cry!",f
26916,"I had no idea of all this--why, I was sure that you loved Lovelace--I never doubted it--why in the world did you not tell me the truth?""",f
26917,"She sat up at that, and looked at him.",f

26919,"""I was quite certain that you loved Isabella Fanshawe.",f
26920,"I felt I had to go away, and I could not do it alone--so--so--so, of course I had to elope.",f

26924,"""Ay, I'll tell him.",f
26925,"'Pon rep., sweetheart, I can find it in me to be sorry for him!""",f
26926,"""Oh, he will not mind for long,"" she said philosophically.",f
26927,"""He loves so _easily_, you see!",f
26928,"But you, Dick--why did you go so often--so _very_ often to see Mrs. Fanshawe?""",f
26929,His face grew solemn.,f
26930,"""She knew--Jack--in Vienna--I--I wanted to hear all she could tell me of him--I could think of nothing else.""",f
26931,"""Oh, Dicky!",f
26932,How--how wickedly foolish I have been!,f

26934,He drew her head down on to his shoulder again.,f
26935,"""My poor love!",f
26936,"Why, 'tis the kindest lady imaginable, but as to loving her--!""",f
26937,He kissed her hand lingeringly.,f

27098,"Once she had made up her mind to face the inevitable, Lavinia quite enjoyed all the preparations.",f
27099,"The new house in Great Jermyn Street she voted charming, and she straightway set to work to buy very expensive furniture for it, and to superintend all the alterations.",f
27100,"In her present penitent mood she would even have accompanied her husband to Wyncham on Monday, to stand by him on the fateful Friday; but this he would not allow, insisting that she remain in town until his return.",f
27101,"So she fluttered contentedly from Grosvenor Square to Jermyn Street, very busy and quite happy.",f
27102,"Carstares was to travel to Wyncham on Monday, arriving there the following evening in company with Andrew, whom he was taking as far as Andover.",f
27103,"His lordship had lately embroiled himself in a quarrel over a lady when deep in his cups, and owing to the subsequent duel at Barn Elms and the almost overpowering nature of his debts, he deemed it prudent to go into seclusion for a spell.",f
27104,"Tracy disappeared from town in the middle of the week, whither no one knew, but it was universally believed that he had gone to Scotland on a visit.",f
27105,Monday at length dawned fair and promising.,f
27106,"After bidding his wife a very tender farewell, and gently drying her wet eyelashes with his own handkerchief, Richard set out with his brother-in-law in the big travelling chaise soon after noon.",f
27107,"Andrew had quite recovered his hitherto rather dampened spirits, and produced a dice-box from one pocket and a pack of cards from the other wherewith to beguile the tedium of the journey.",f
27108,"CHAPTER XXV  HIS GRACE OF ANDOVER CAPTURES THE QUEEN   Diana stood in the old oak porch, riding-whip in hand, and the folds of her voluminous gown over her arm.",f
27109,"Miss Betty stood beside her, surveying her with secret pride.",f
27110,"Diana's eyes seemed darker than ever, she thought, and the mouth more tragic.",f
27111,"She knew that the girl was, to use her own expression, ""moping quite prodigiously for that Mr. Carr.""",f
27112,"Not all that she could do to entertain Diana entirely chased away the haunting sadness in her face; for a time she would be gay, but afterwards the laughter died away and she was silent.",f
27113,Many times had Miss Betty shaken her fist at the absent John.,f
27114,"Presently Diana gave a tiny sigh, and looked down at her aunt, smiling.",f
27115,"""You would be surprised how excellently well Harper manages the horses,"" she said.",f
27116,"""He is quite a godsend.",f
27117,"So much nicer than that stupid William.""",f
27118,"""Indeed, yes,"" agreed Miss Betty.",f
27119,"""Only think, my dear, he was groom to Sir Hugh Grandison--I saw the letter Sir Hugh writ your Papa--a remarkable elegant epistle, I assure you, my love.""",f
27120,"Diana nodded and watched the new groom ride up, leading her mount.",f
27121,"He jumped down, and, touching his hat, stood awaiting his mistress's pleasure.",f
27122,"Diana went up to the cob, patting his glossy neck.",f
27123,"""We are going towards Ashley to-day, aunt,"" she said.",f
27124,"""I am so anxious to find some berries, and Harper tells me they grow in profusion not far from here.""",f
27125,"""Now, my dear, pray do not tire yourself by going too far--I doubt it will rain before long and you will catch your death of cold!""",f
27126,Diana laughed at her.,f
27127,"""Oh, no, aunt!",f
27128,"Why, the sky is almost cloudless!",f
27129,"But we shall not be long, I promise you.",f
27130,"Only as far as Crossdown Woods and back again.""",f
27131,She gave her foot to the groom just as Mr. Beauleigh came out to watch her start.,f
27132,"""Really, my dear, I must ride with you to-morrow,"" he told her.",f
27133,"""'Tis an age since we have been out together.""",f
27134,"""Why, Papa, will you not accompany me this afternoon?"" cried Diana eagerly.",f
27135,"""I should so like it!""",f
27136,It struck her aunt that Harper awaited the answer to this question rather anxiously.,f
27137,"She watched him, puzzled.",f
27138,"However, when Mr. Beauleigh had refused she could not see any change in his expression, and concluded that she must have been mistaken.",f
27139,"So with a wave of her hand, Diana rode away, the groom following at a respectful distance.",f
27140,Yet somehow Miss Betty was uneasy.,f
27141,"A presentiment of evil seemed to touch her, and when the riders had disappeared round a bend in the road she felt an insane desire to run after them and call her niece back.",f
27142,"She gave herself a little shake, saying that she was a fond old woman, over-anxious about Diana.",f
27143,"Nevertheless, she laid a detaining hand on her brother's arm as he was about to go indoors.",f
27144,"""Wait, Horace!",f
27145,"You--you _will_ ride with Di more frequently, will you not?""",f
27146,He looked surprised.,f
27147,"""You are uneasy, Betty?""",f
27148,"""Oh--uneasy--!",f
27149,"Well, yes--a little.",f
27150,"I do not like her to go alone with a groom, and we do not know this man.""",f
27151,"""My dear!",f
27152,"I had the very highest references from Sir Hugh Grandison, who, I am sure, would never recommend anyone untrustworthy.",f
27153,"Why, you saw the letter yourself!""",f
27154,"""Yes, yes.",f
27155,Doubtless I am very stupid.,f
27156,"But you _will_ ride with her after to-day, will you not?""",f
27157,"""Certainly I will accompany my daughter when I can spare the time,"" he replied with dignity, and with that she had to be content.",f
27158,"Diana rode leisurely along the lane, beside great trees and hedges that were a blaze of riotous colour.",f
27159,"Autumn had turned the leaves dull gold and flame, mellow brown and deepest red, with flaming orange intermingled, and touches of copper here and there where some beech tree stood.",f
27160,"The lane was like a fairy picture, too gorgeous to be real; the trees, meeting overhead, but let the sunlight through in patches, so that the dusty road beneath was mottled with gold.",f
27161,"The hedges retained their greenness, and where there was a gap a vista of fields presented itself.",f
27162,"And then they came upon a clump of berries, black and red, growing the other side of the little stream that meandered along the lane in a ditch.",f
27163,Diana drew up and addressed her companion.,f
27164,"""See, Harper--there are berries!",f
27165,"We need go no further.""",f
27166,She changed the reins to her right hand and made as if to spring down.,f
27167,"""The place I spoke of is but a short way on, miss,"" ventured the man, keeping his seat.",f
27168,She paused.,f
27169,"""But why will these not suffice?""",f
27170,"""Well, miss, if you like.",f
27171,But those others were a deal finer.,f
27172,"It seems a pity not to get some.""",f
27173,Diana looked doubtfully along the road.,f
27174,"""'Tis not far?""",f
27175,"""No, miss; but another quarter of a mile, and then down the track by the wood.""",f
27176,Still she hesitated.,f
27177,"""I do not want to be late,"" she demurred.",f
27178,"""No, miss, of course not.",f
27179,"I only thought as how we might come back by way of Chorly Fields.""",f
27180,"""Round by the mill?",f
27181,"H'm....""",f
27182,"""Yes, miss.",f
27183,"Then as soon as we get past it there is a clear stretch of turf almost up to the house.""",f
27184,Her eye brightened.,f
27185,"""A gallop?",f
27186,Very well!,f
27187,"But let us hurry on.""",f
27188,"She touched the cob with her heel, and they trotted on briskly out of the leafy canopy along the road with blue sky above and pasture land around.",f
27189,"After a little while the wood came in sight, and in a minute they were riding down the track at right angles to the road.",f
27190,"Harper was at Diana's heels, drawing nearer.",f
27191,Half unconsciously she quickened her pace.,f
27192,There was not a soul in sight.,f
27193,"They were coming to a bend in the road, and now Harper was alongside.",f
27194,"Choking a ridiculous feeling of frightened apprehension, Diana drew rein.",f
27195,"""I do not perceive those berries!"" she said lightly.",f
27196,"""No, miss,"" was the immediate response.",f
27197,"""They are just a step into the wood.",f
27198,"If you care to dismount here I can show you.""",f
27199,Nothing could be more respectful than the man's tone.,f
27200,Diana shook off her nervous qualms and slipped down.,f
27201,"Harper, already on the ground, took the cob's rein and tied both horses to a tree.",f
27202,Diana gathered her skirts over her arm and picked her way through the brambles to where he had pointed.,f
27203,"The blackberry hedges he held back for her entrance swung back after they had passed, completely shutting out all view of the road.",f
27204,There were no berries.,f
27205,"Diana's heart was beating very fast, all her suspicions springing to life again, but she showed no sign of fear as she desired him to hold the brambles back again for her to pass out.",f
27206,"""For there are no berries here, as you can see for yourself.""",f
27207,She swept round and walked calmly towards the bushes.,f
27208,"Then, how she could never quite remember, she was seized from behind, and before she had time to move, a long piece of silk was flung over her head and drawn tight across her mouth, while an arm, as of steel, held and controlled her.",f
27209,"Fighting madly, she managed to get one arm free, and struck out furiously with her slender crop.",f
27210,"There was a brief struggle, and it was twisted from her grasp, and her hands tied behind her, despite all her efforts to be free.",f
27211,"Then her captor swung her writhing into his arms, and strode away through the wood without a word.",f
27212,"Diana was passive now, reserving her strength for when it might avail her something, but above the gag her eyes blazed with mingled fright and fury.",f
27213,"She noticed that she was being carried not into the wood, but along it, and was not surprised when they emerged on to the road where it had rounded the bend.",f
27214,"With a sick feeling of terror, she saw a coach standing in the road, and guessed, even before she knew, what was her fate.",f
27215,"Through a haze she saw a man standing at the door, and then she was thrust into the coach and made to sit down on the softly-cushioned seat.",f
27216,All her energies were concentrated in fighting against the faintness that threatened to overcome her.,f
27217,"She won gradually, and strained her ears to catch what was being said outside.",f
27218,"She caught one sentence in a familiar, purring voice:  ""Set them loose and tie this to the pummel.""",f
27219,Then there was silence.,f
27220,Presently she heard footsteps returning.,f
27221,"An indistinguishable murmur from Harper, and the door opened to allow his Grace of Andover to enter the coach.",f
27222,It gave a lurch and rumbled on.,f
27223,Tracy looked down with a slight smile into the gold-flecked eyes that blazed so indignantly into his.,f
27224,"""A thousand apologies, Miss Beauleigh!",f
27225,"Allow me to remove this scarf.""",f
27226,"As he spoke he untied the knot, and the silk fell away from her face.",f
27227,"For a moment she was silent, struggling for words wherewith to give vent to her fury; then the red lips parted and the small, white teeth showed, clenched tightly together.",f
27228,"""You cur!"" she flung at him in a panting undertone.",f
27229,"""Oh, you cur!--you coward!",f
27230,"Undo my hands!""",f
27231,"""With pleasure.""",f
27232,He bowed and busied himself with this tighter knot.,f
27233,"""Pray, accept my heartfelt apologies for incommoding you so grievously.",f
27234,"I am sure that you will admit the necessity.""",f
27235,"""Oh, that there were a _man_ here to avenge me!"" she raged.",f
27236,His Grace tugged at the stubborn knot.,f
27237,"""There are three outside,"" he answered blandly.",f
27238,"""But I do not think they are like to oblige you.""",f
27239,"He removed her bonds and sat back in the corner, enjoying her.",f
27240,"His eyes fell on her bruised wrists, and at once his expression changed, and he frowned, leaning forward.",f
27241,"""Believe me, I did not mean that,"" he said, and touched her hands.",f
27242,She flung him off.,f
27243,"""Do not touch me!""",f
27244,"""I beg your pardon, my dear.""",f
27245,He leaned back again nonchalantly.,f
27246,"""Where are you taking me?"" she demanded, trying to conceal the fear in her voice.",f
27247,"""Home,"" replied his Grace.",f
27248,"""Home!""",f
27249,"Incredulously she turned to look at him, hope in her eyes.",f
27250,"""Home,"" he reiterated.",f
27251,"""_Our_ home.""",f
27252,The hope died out.,f
27253,"""You are ridiculous, sir.""",f
27254,"""'Tis an art, my dear, most difficult to acquire.""",f
27255,"""Sir--Mr. Everard--whoever you are--if you have any spark of manliness in you, of chivalry, if you care for me at all, you will this instant set me down!""",f
27256,"Never had she seemed more beautiful, more desirable.",f
27257,"Her eyes shone with unshed tears, soft and luminous, and the tragic mouth pleaded, even trying to smile.",f
27258,"""It would appear that none of these attributes belongs to me,"" murmured his Grace, and wondered if she would weep.",f
27259,He had never a taste for a weeping woman.,f
27260,But Diana was proud.,f
27261,"She realised that tears, prayers and all would avail her nothing, and she was determined not to break down, at least in his presence.",f
27262,Tracy was surprised to see her arrange her skirts and settle back against the cushions in the most unconcerned manner possible.,f
27263,"""Then, since you are so ungallant, sir, pray tell me what you purpose doing with me?""",f
27264,"The tone was light, even bantering, but with his marvellous, almost uncanny perspicacity, he sensed the breathless terror behind it.",f
27265,"""Why, my dear, I had planned to marry you,"" he answered, bowing.",f
27266,The knuckles gleamed white on her clenched hand.,f
27267,"""And if I refuse?""",f
27268,"""I do not _think_ you will refuse, my dear.""",f
27269,She could not repress a shiver.,f
27270,"""I do refuse!"" she cried sharply.",f
27271,The smile with which he received this statement drove the blood cold in her veins.,f
27272,"""Wait.",f
27273,"I think you will be glad to marry me--in the end,"" he drawled.",f
27274,"Her great eyes were hunted, desperate, and her face was very white.",f
27275,The dry lips parted.,f
27276,"""I think--you will be--very sorry--when my father--comes.""",f
27277,The indulgent sneer brought the blood racing back to her cheeks.,f
27278,"""And he will come!""",f
27279,His Grace was politely interested.,f
27280,"""Really?",f
27281,"But I do not doubt it, Diana, an he knows where to come.""",f
27282,"""He will find a way, never fear!""",f
27283,She laughed with a confidence she was far from feeling.,f
27284,"""I do not fear--not in the least--I shall be delighted to welcome him,"" promised his Grace.",f
27285,"""I do not anticipate a refusal of your hand from him.""",f
27286,"""No?""",f
27287,"Diana, too, could sneer.",f
27288,"""No, my dear.",f
27289,"Not after a little--persuasion.""",f
27290,"""Who are you?"" she shot at him.",f
27291,His shoulders shook in the soundless laugh peculiar to him.,f
27292,"""I am several people, child.""",f
27293,"""So I apprehend,"" she retorted smoothly.",f
27294,"""Sir Hugh Grandison amongst them?""",f
27295,"""Ah, you have guessed that?""",f
27296,"""It rather leaps to the eye, sir.""",f
27297,She spoke in what was almost an exact imitation of his sarcastic tone.,f
27298,"""True.",f
27299,"It was neatly done, I flatter myself.""",f
27300,"""Quite marvellous, indeed.""",f
27301,He was enjoying her as he had rarely enjoyed a woman before.,f
27302,"Others had sobbed and implored, railed and raved; he had never till now met one who returned him word for word, using his own weapons against him.",f
27303,"""Who else have you the honour to be?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.",f
27304,"""I am Mr. Everard, child, and Duke of Andover.""",f
27305,Then she turned her head and looked at him with glittering eyes.,f
27306,"""I have heard of you, sir,"" she said, evenly.",f
27307,"""You are like to hear more, my dear.""",f
27308,"""That is as may be, your Grace.""",f
27309,"Now she understood the elaborate hilt of the mysterious sword with the coronet on it, wrought in jewels.",f
27310,"She wondered whether Jack had it still, wherever he was.",f
27311,If only some wonderful providence would bring him to her now in her dire need!,f
27312,"There was no one to strike a blow for her; she was entirely at the mercy of a ruthless libertine, whose reputation she knew well, and whose presence filled her with dread and a speechless loathing.",f
27313,She felt very doubtful that her father would succeed in finding her.,f
27314,If only Jack were in England!,f
27315,"He would come to her, she knew.",f
27316,"His Grace leaned towards her, laying a thin, white hand on her knee.",f
27317,"""My dear, be reasonable.",f
27318,"I am not such a bad bargain after all.""",f
27319,The tenderness in his voice filled her with horror.,f
27320,He felt her shrink away.,f
27321,"""Take your hand away!"" she commanded throbbingly.",f
27322,"""Do not touch me!""",f
27323,He laughed softly and at the sound of it she controlled her terrors and dropped again to the mocking tone she had adopted.,f
27324,"""What?",f
27325,"Ungallant still, your Grace?",f
27326,"Pray keep your distance!""",f
27327,The pistol holster on the wall at her side caught her attention.,f
27328,"Instantly she looked away, hoping he had not observed her.",f
27329,Very little escaped his Grace.,f
27330,"""I am desolated to have to disappoint you, my dear.",f
27331,"It is empty.""",f
27332,"She laid a careless hand on the holster, verifying his statement.",f
27333,"""This?",f
27334,"Oh, I guessed it, your Grace!""",f
27335,He admired her spirit more and more.,f
27336,Was there ever such a girl?,f
27337,"""My name is Tracy,"" he remarked.",f
27338,She considered it with her head tilted to one side.,f
27339,"""I do not like your name, sir,"" she answered.",f
27340,"""'There was no thought of pleasing you when I was christened,'"" he quoted lazily.",f
27341,"""Hardly, sir,"" she said.",f
27342,"""You might be my father.""",f
27343,"It was a master stroke, and for an instant his brows drew together.",f
27344,Then he laughed.,f
27345,"""_Merci du compliment, mademoiselle_!",f
27346,"I admire your wit.""",f
27347,"""I protest I am overwhelmed.",f
27348,"May I ask when we are like to arrive at our destination?""",f
27349,"""We should reach Andover soon after eight, my dear.""",f
27350,So it was some distance he was taking her?,f
27351,"""I suppose you had the wit to provide food for the journey?"" she yawned.",f
27352,"""You will not wish to exhibit me at an inn, I take it?""",f
27353,"He marvelled at her indomitable courage  ""We shall halt at an inn certainly, and my servant will bring you refreshment.",f
27354,"That will be in about an hour.""",f
27355,"""So long?"" she frowned.",f
27356,"""Then, pray excuse me an I compose myself to sleep a little.",f
27357,"I am like to find the journey somewhat tedious, I fear.""",f
27358,"She shifted farther into the corner, leaned her head back against the cushions and closed her eyes.",f
27359,Thus outwitting his Grace.,f
27360,For it is impossible to be passionate with a girl who feigns sleep when she should be struggling to escape from you.,f
27361,"So Tracy, who, whatever else he might lack, possessed a keen sense of humour, settled himself in his corner and followed her example.",f
27362,So they jogged on....,f
27363,"Arrived at length at the inn, the coach pulled up slowly.",f
27364,Diana opened her eyes with a great assumption of sleepiness.,f
27365,"""Already?"" she marvelled.",f
27366,"""I trust you have slept well,"" said his Grace suavely.",f
27367,"""Excellently well, I thank you, sir,"" was the unblushing reply.",f
27368,"""I am relieved to hear you say so, my dear.",f
27369,I had thought you unable to--your mouth kept shut so admirably.,f
27370,Doubtless you have schooled your jaw not to drop when you sleep sitting up?,f
27371,"I wish I might do the same.""",f
27372,The triumph in his voice was thinly veiled.,f
27373,She found nothing to say.,f
27374,He rose.,f
27375,"""With your leave, I will go to procure you some refreshment, child.",f
27376,"Do not think me uncivil if I remind you that a servant stands without either door.""",f
27377,"""I thank you for the kind thought,"" she smiled, but her heart was sick within her.",f
27378,"He disappeared, returning a few moments later with a glass of wine and some little cakes.",f
27379,"""I deplore the scanty nature of your repast,"" he said.",f
27380,"""But I do not wish to waste time.",f
27381,"You shall be more fittingly entertained when we reach Andover.""",f
27382,"Diana drank the wine gratefully, and it seemed to put new life into her.",f
27383,"The food almost choked her, but rather than let him see it, she broke a cake in half and started to eat it, playing to gain time: time in which to allow her father a chance of overtaking them before it was too late.",f
27384,"She affected to dislike the cake, and rather petulantly demanded a 'maid of honour.'",f
27385,Tracy's eyes gleamed.,f
27386,"""I fear I cannot oblige you, my dear.",f
27387,"When we are married you can go to Richmond, and you shall have maids of honour in plenty.""",f
27388,"He relieved her of her glass, taking it from hands that trembled pitifully.",f
27389,The rest of the journey was as some terrible nightmare.,f
27390,She felt that she dared no longer feign sleep.,f
27391,"She was terrified at what his Grace might do, and kept him at arm's length by means of her tongue and all her woman's wit.",f
27392,"As a matter of fact, Andover had himself well in hand, and had no intention of letting his passion run away with him.",f
27393,"But as the time went on and the light went, some of Diana's control seemed to slip from her, and she became a little less the self-possessed woman, and a little more the trapped and frightened child.",f
27394,"When they at last reached Andover Court, and his Grace assisted her to alight her legs would barely carry her up the steps to the great iron-clamped door.",f
27395,She trembled anew as he took her hand.,f
27396,On the threshold he paused and bowed very low.,f
27397,"""Welcome to your future home, my queen,"" he murmured, and led her in, past wooden-faced footmen who stared over her head, to his private room, where a table was set for two.",f
27398,"He would have taken her in his arms then, but she evaded him and slipped wearily into a chair.",f
27399,"""I protest,"" she managed to say, ""I protest, I am faint through want of food.""",f
27400,"Andover, looking at her white lips, believed her.",f
27401,He took a seat opposite.,f
27402,"Two footmen came to wait on them, and although her very soul was shamed that they should see her there, she was thankful for their restraining presence.",f
27403,"CHAPTER XXVI  MY LORD RIDES TO FRUSTRATE HIS GRACE   My lord yawned most prodigiously and let fall the _Spectator._ His eyes roved towards the clock, and noted with disgust that the hands pointed to half after five.",f
27404,He sighed and picked up the _Rambler_.,f
27405,"His host and hostess were visiting some miles distant, and were not likely to be back until late, so my lord had a long dull evening in front of him, which he relished not at all.",f
27406,"Lady O'Hara had tried to induce him to accompany them, promising that he would meet no one he knew, but he had for once been prudent and refused steadfastly.",f
27407,"So my lady, after pouting crossly at him and assuring him that he was by far the most obstinate and disagreeable man that she had ever come across, not excepting her husband, who, to be sure, had been quite prodigiously annoying all day, relented, told him she understood perfectly, and even offered to kiss him to make up for her monstrous ill-humour.",f
27408,"Jack accepted the offer promptly, waved farewell to her from the porch, and returned to the empty drawing-room to while away the time with two numbers of the _Spectator_ and his own thoughts till dinner, which was to be later than usual to-day, on account of an attack of vapours which had seized the cook.",f
27409,His thoughts were too unpleasant to be dwelt on; everything in his world seemed to have gone awry.,f
27410,So he occupied himself with what seemed to him a particularly uninteresting number of the _Spectator_.,f
27411,"The sun had almost disappeared, and very soon it became too dark to read; no candles having been brought as yet, my lord, very unromantically, went to sleep in his chair.",f
27412,"Whether he would have eventually snored is not known, for not more than a quarter of an hour afterwards the butler roused him with the magic words:  ""Dinner is served, sir.""",f
27413,Carstares turned his head lazily.,f
27414,"""What's that you say, James?""",f
27415,"""Dinner is served, sir,"" repeated the man, and held the door wide for him to pass out.",f
27416,"""Faith!",f
27417,"I'm glad to hear it!""",f
27418,My lord rose leisurely and pulled his cravat more precisely into position.,f
27419,"Although he was to be alone, he gave his costume a touch here and there, and flicked a speck of dust from one great cuff with his elegant lace handkerchief.",f
27420,"He strolled across the old panelled hall to the dining-room, and sat down at the table.",f
27421,"The curtains were drawn across the windows, and clusters of candles in graceful silver holders were arranged on the table, shedding a warm light on to the white damask and the shining covers.",f
27422,"The footmen presented a fish, and my lord permitted a little to be put on his plate.",f
27423,"The butler desired to know if Mr. Carr would drink claret or burgundy, or ale?",f
27424,Mr. Carr would drink claret.,f
27425,"A sirloin of beef next made its appearance, and went away considerably smaller.",f
27426,Then before my lord was spread an array of dishes.,f
27427,"Partridges flanked one end, a pasty stood next, a cream, two chickens, a duck, and a ham of noble proportions.",f
27428,My lord went gently through.,f
27429,The butler desired to know if Mr. Carr would drink a glass of burgundy?,f
27430,He exhibited a dusty bottle.,f
27431,My lord considered it through his eyeglass and decided in favour.,f
27432,He sipped reflectively and waved the ham away.,f
27433,"Sweetmeats appeared before him and a soup, while plump pigeons were uncovered at his elbow.",f
27434,"One was whipped deftly on to his plate, and as he took up his knife and fork to carve it, a great scuffling sounded without, angry voices being raised in expostulation, and, above all, a breathless, insistent appeal for Mr. Carr or Sir Miles.",f
27435,My lord laid down the knife and fork and came to his feet.,f
27436,"""It appears I am demanded,"" he said, and went to the door.",f
27437,"It was opened for him at once, and he stepped out into the hall to find Mr. Beauleigh trying to dodge the younger footman, who was refusing to let him pass.",f
27438,At the sight of Carstares he stepped back respectfully.,f
27439,"Mr. Beauleigh, hot, distraught, breathless, fell upon my lord.",f
27440,"""Thank God you are here, sir!"" he cried.",f
27441,Carstares observed him with some surprise.,f
27442,Mr. Beauleigh had been so very frigid when last they had met.,f
27443,"""I am glad to be at your service, sir,"" he bowed.",f
27444,"""You have commands for me?""",f
27445,"""We are in terrible trouble,"" almost moaned the other.",f
27446,"""Betty bade me come to find you, or failing you, Sir Miles, for none other can help us!""",f
27447,Carstares' glance grew sharper.,f
27448,"""Trouble?",f
27449,"Not--But I forget my manners--we shall talk more at ease in here.""",f
27450,He led Mr. Beauleigh into the morning-room.,f
27451,Beauleigh thrust a paper into his hands.,f
27452,"""Diana went riding this afternoon, and only her horse returned--with this attached to the pommel!",f
27453,"Read it, sir!",f
27454,"Read it!""",f
27455,"""Diana!""",f
27456,"Carstares strode over to the light, and devoured the contents of the single sheet, with eager eyes.",f
27457,"They were not long, and they were very much to the point:  ""Mr. Beauleigh may haply recall to mind a certain 'Mr. Everard,' of Bath, whose Addresses to Miss Beauleigh were cruelly repulsed.",f
27458,"He regrets having now to take the Matter into his Own Hands, and trusts to further his Acquaintance with Mr. Beauleigh at some Future Date, when Miss Beauleigh shall, He trusts, have become 'Mrs. Everard.'""  Jack crumpled the paper furiously in his hand, grinding out a startling oath.",f
27459,"""--insolent cur!""",f
27460,"""Yes, yes, sir!",f
27461,But what will that avail my daughter?,f
27462,"I have come straight to you, for my sister is convinced you know this Everard, and can tell me where to seek them!""",f
27463,Carstares clapped a hand on his shoulder.,f
27464,"""Never fear, Mr. Beauleigh!",f
27465,"I pledge you my word she shall be found this very night!""",f
27466,"""You know where he has taken her?",f
27467,You do?,f
27468,"You are sure?""",f
27469,"""Back to his earth, I'll lay my life;",f
27470,"'tis ever his custom.""",f
27471,"He strode to the door, flung it wide and shot clear, crisp directions at the footman.",f
27472,"""See to it that my mare is saddled in ten minutes and Blue Devil harnessed to your master's curricle!",f
27473,Don't stand staring--go!,f
27474,"And send Salter to me!""",f
27475,"The footman scuttled away, pausing only to inform my lord that Salter was not in.",f
27476,"Carstares remembered that he had given Jim leave to visit his Mary at Fittering, and crushed out another oath.",f
27477,"He sprang up the stairs, Mr. Beauleigh following breathlessly.",f
27478,"In his room, struggling with his boots, he put a few questions.",f
27479,"Mr. Beauleigh related the whole tale, dwelling mournfully on the excellent references for Harper he had received from Sir Hugh Grandison.",f
27480,Jack hauled at his second boot.,f
27481,"""Tracy himself, of course!"" he fumed, adjusting his spurs.",f
27482,"""Pray, Mr. Carr, who is this scoundrel?",f
27483,"Is it true that you know him?""",f
27484,"""Andover,"" answered Jack from the depths of the garde-robe.",f
27485,"""Damn the fellow, where has he put my cloak?""",f
27486,"This to the absent Jim, and not the Duke.",f
27487,"""Andover!",f
27488,"Not--surely not the Duke?"" cried Mr. Beauleigh.",f
27489,"""I know of none other.",f
27490,"At last!""",f
27491,"He emerged and tossed a heavy, many-caped coat on to the bed.",f
27492,"""Now, sir, your attention for one moment.""",f
27493,"He was buckling on his sword as he spoke, and not looking at the other man.",f
27494,"""Tracy will have borne Di--Miss Beauleigh off to Andover Court, seven miles beyond Wyncham, to the south-west.",f
27495,"Your horse, I take it, is not fresh,"" (he knew Mr. Beauleigh's horse).",f
27496,"""I have ordered the curricle for you.",f
27497,"I will ride on at once by short cuts, for there is not a moment to be lost--""  ""The Duke of Andover!"" interrupted Mr. Beauleigh.",f
27498,"""The Duke of Andover!",f
27499,"Why, do you think he purposes to marry my daughter?""",f
27500,"Jack gave a short, furious laugh.",f
27501,"""Ay!",f
27502,"As he married all the others!""",f
27503,Mr. Beauleigh winced.,f
27504,"""Sir!",f
27505,"Pray why should you say so?""",f
27506,"""I perceive you do not know his Grace.",f
27507,"Perchance you have heard of Devil Belmanoir?""",f
27508,Then the little man paled.,f
27509,"""Good God, Mr. Carr, 'tis not he?""",f
27510,Carstares caught up his hat and whip.,f
27511,"""Ay, Mr. Beauleigh, 'tis indeed he.",f
27512,"Now perhaps you appreciate the necessity for haste?""",f
27513,Mr. Beauleigh's eyes were open at last.,f
27514,"""For God's sake, Mr. Carr, after them!""",f
27515,"""'Tis what I intend, sir.",f
27516,"You will follow as swiftly as possible?""",f
27517,"""Yes, yes, but do not wait for anything!",f
27518,"Can you reach Andover--in time?""",f
27519,"""I reach Andover to-night,"" was the grim answer.",f
27520,"""And you, sir?",f
27521,"You know the road?""",f
27522,"""I will find out.",f
27523,"Only go, Mr. Carr!",f
27524,"Do not waste time, I implore you!""",f
27525,"Jack struggled into his riding coat, clapped his hat on to his head, and with his Grace of Andover's sword tucked beneath his arm, went down the stairs three and four at a time, and hurried out on to the drive, where the groom stood waiting with Jenny's bridle over his arm.",f
27526,Carstares cast a hasty glance at the girths and sprang up.,f
27527,"The mare sidled and fidgeted, fretting to be gone, but was held in with a hand of iron while her master spoke to the groom.",f
27528,"""You must drive Mr. Beauleigh to Andover Court as fast as you can.",f
27529,It is a matter of life and death.,f
27530,"You know the way?""",f
27531,The amazed groom collected his wits with difficulty.,f
27532,"""Roughly, sir.""",f
27533,"""That will do--Mr. Beauleigh will know.",f
27534,"Drive your damnedest, man--Sir Miles won't mind.",f
27535,"You understand?""",f
27536,Jack's word was law in the O'Hara household.,f
27537,"""Yes, sir,"" answered the man, and touched his hat.",f
27538,"On the word, he saw the beautiful straining mare leap forward, and the next moment both horse and rider were swallowed in the gloom.",f
27539,"""Well I'm--darned,"" exploded the groom, and turned to fetch the curricle.",f
27540,"Across the stretch of moorland went Jack at a gallop, Jenny speeding under him like the wind, and seeming to catch something of her master's excitement.",f
27541,"Low over her neck he bent, holding the Duke's sword across his saddle-bows with one hand and with the other guiding her.",f
27542,So he covered some three miles.,f
27543,"He reined in then, and forced her to a canter, saving her strength for the long distance ahead of them.",f
27544,"She was in splendid condition, glorying in the unrestrained gallop across the turf, and although she was too well-mannered to pull on the rein, Carstares could see by the eager twitching of her ears how she longed to be gone over the ground.",f
27545,He spoke soothingly to her and guided her on to the very lane where Diana had ridden that afternoon.,f
27546,"She fell into a long, easy stride that seemed to eat up the ground.",f
27547,"Now they were off the lane, riding over a field to join another road, leading west.",f
27548,"A hedge cut them off, but the mare gathered her legs beneath her and soared over, alighting as gracefully as a bird, and skimming on again up the road.",f
27549,"Her responsive ears flickered as he praised her, and pulled her up.",f
27550,"""Easy now, Jenny, easy!""",f
27551,"She was trembling with excitement, but she yielded to his will and trotted quietly for perhaps another half-hour.",f
27552,"Carstares rose and fell rhythmically in the saddle, taking care to keep his spurred heels from her glossy sides.",f
27553,"He guessed the time to be about seven o'clock, and his brows drew together worriedly.",f
27554,"Jenny was made of steel and lightning, but would she manage it?",f
27555,"He had never tested her powers as he was about to now, and he dared not allow her much breathing space.",f
27556,Every minute was precious if he were to reach Andover before it was too late.,f
27557,"Assuming that Tracy had captured Diana at four, or thereabouts, he reckoned that it should take a heavy coach four hours or more to reach Andover.",f
27558,"Jenny might manage it in two and a half hours, allowing for short cuts, in which case he ought to arrive not long after the others.",f
27559,He was tortured by the thought of Diana at the mercy of a man of Tracy's calibre;,f
27560,Diana in terror;,f
27561,Diana despairing.,f
27562,"Unconsciously he pressed his knees against the smooth flank and once more Jenny fell into that long, swift stride.",f
27563,She seemed to glide over the ground with never a jar nor a stumble.,f
27564,"Carstares was careful not to irk her in any way, only keeping a guiding, restraining hand on the rein, and for the rest letting her go as she willed.",f
27565,"On and on they sped, as the time lagged by, sometimes through leafy lanes, at others over fields and rough tracks.",f
27566,"Not for nothing had Carstares roamed this country for two years; almost every path was familiar to him; he never took a wrong turn, never swerved, never hesitated.",f
27567,"On and on, past sleeping villages and lonely homesteads, skirting woods, riding up hill and down dale, never slackening his hold on the rein, never taking his eyes off the road before him, except now and then to throw a glance to the side on the look-out for some hidden by-path.",f
27568,"After the first hour a dull pain in his shoulder reminded him of his wound, still troublesome.",f
27569,He set his teeth and pressed on still faster.,f
27570,The mare caught her foot on a loose stone and stumbled.,f
27571,"His hand held her together, the muscles standing out like ribbed steel, his voice encouraged her, and he made her walk again.",f
27572,This time she did not fret against the restraint.,f
27573,"He shifted the sword under his bridle hand, and passed the right down her steaming neck, crooning to her softly beneath his breath.",f
27574,"She answered with a low, throbbing whinny.",f
27575,"She could not understand why he desired her to gallop on, braving unknown terrors in the dark; all she could know was that it was his wish.",f
27576,It seemed also that he was pleased with her.,f
27577,"She would have cantered on again, but he made her walk for, perhaps, another five minutes, until they were come to a stretch of common he knew well.",f
27578,"It was getting late, and he pressed her with his knee, adjuring her to do her best, and urging her to a gallop, leaning right forward, the better to pierce the darkness ahead.",f
27579,"A gorse bush loomed before them, and Jenny shied at it, redoubling her pace.",f
27580,"With hand and voice he soothed her, and on they sped.",f
27581,"He judged the time to be now about half-past eight, and knew that they must make the remaining miles in an hour.",f
27582,"Even now the coach might have arrived, and beyond that he dared not think.",f
27583,"Another half-hour crept by, and he could feel the mare's breath coming short and fast, and reined in again, this time to a canter.",f
27584,"He was off the moor now, on a road he remembered well, and knew himself to be not ten miles from Wyncham.",f
27585,Five more miles as the crow flies....,f
27586,"He knew he must give Jenny another rest, and pulled up, dismounting and going to her head.",f
27587,"Her legs were trembling, and the sweat rolled off her satin skin.",f
27588,"She dropped her nose into his hand, sobbingly.",f
27589,"He rubbed her ears and patted her, and she lipped his cheek lovingly, breathing more easily.",f
27590,"Up again then, and forward once more, skimming over the ground.",f
27591,"Leaving Wyncham on his right, Carstares cut west and then north-west, on the highroad now, leading to Andover.",f
27592,Only two more miles to go....,f
27593,Jenny stumbled again and broke into a walk.,f
27594,"Her master tapped her shoulder, and she picked up her stride again.",f
27595,"She was almost winded, and he knew it, but he had to force her onwards.",f
27596,"She responded gallantly to his hand, although her breath came sobbingly and her great, soft eyes were blurred.",f
27597,"At last the great iron gates were in view; he could see them through the dusk, firmly shut.",f
27598,"He pulled up and walked on, looking for a place in the hedge where Jenny might push through.",f
27599,"CHAPTER XXVII  MY LORD ENTERS BY THE WINDOW   His Grace of Andover made a sign to the footmen, and with a sinking heart Diana watched them leave the room, discreetly closing the door behind them.",f
27600,"She affected to eat a peach, skinning it with fingers that were stiff and wooden.",f
27601,"Tracy leaned back in his chair, surveying her through half-shut eyelids.",f
27602,"He watched her eat her peach and rise to her feet standing with her hand on the back of the high, carved chair.",f
27603,She addressed him nervously and with would-be lightness.,f
27604,"""Well, sir, I have eaten, and I protest I am fatigued.",f
27605,"Pray have the goodness to conduct me to your housekeeper.""",f
27606,"""My dear,"" he drawled, ""nothing would give me greater pleasure--always supposing that I possessed one.""",f
27607,She raised her eyebrows haughtily.,f
27608,"""I presume you have at least a maidservant,"" she inquired.",f
27609,"""If I am to remain here, I would retire.""",f
27610,"""You shall, child, all in good time.",f
27611,"But do not be in a hurry to deprive me of your fair company.""",f
27612,"He rose as he spoke, and taking her hand, led her dumbly to a low-backed settee at the other end of the great room.",f
27613,"""If you have aught to say to me, your Grace, I beg that you will reserve it until to-morrow.",f
27614,"I am not in the humour to-night.""",f
27615,He laughed at her.,f
27616,"""Still so cold, child?""",f
27617,"""I am not like to be different, sir.""",f
27618,His eyes glinted.,f
27619,"""You think so?",f
27620,"I shall show you that you are wrong, my dear.",f
27621,"You may loathe me, you may love me, but I think you will lose something of that icy indifference.",f
27622,"Allow me to point out to you that there is a couch behind you.""",f
27623,"""I perceive it, sir.""",f
27624,"""Then be seated.""",f
27625,"""It is not worth the while, sir.",f
27626,"I am not staying.""",f
27627,He advanced one step towards her with that in his face that made her sink hurriedly on to the couch.,f
27628,He nodded smiling.,f
27629,"""You are wise, Diana.""",f
27630,"""Why so free with my name, sir?""",f
27631,This with icy sweetness.,f
27632,"Tracy flung himself down beside her, his arm over the back of the settee and the fingers of his drooping hand just touching her shoulder.",f
27633,It was all the girl could do to keep from screaming.,f
27634,"She felt trapped and helpless, and her nerve was in pieces.",f
27635,"""Nay, sweet!",f
27636,An end to this quibbling.,f
27637,"Bethink you, is it worth your while to anger me?""",f
27638,She sat rigid and silent.,f
27639,"""I love you--ay, you shudder.",f
27640,"One day you will not do that.""",f
27641,"""You call this love, your Grace?"" she cried out, between scorn and misery.",f
27642,"""Something near it,"" he answered imperturbably.",f
27643,"""God help you then!"" she shivered, thinking of one other who had loved her so differently.",f
27644,"""Belike He will,"" was the pleasant rejoinder.",f
27645,"""But we wander from the point.",f
27646,"It is this: you shall retire to your chamber at once--er--armed with the key--an you will swear to marry me to-morrow.""",f
27647,"Very white, she made as if to rise.",f
27648,"The thin fingers closed over her shoulders, forcing her to remain.",f
27649,"""No, my dear.",f
27650,"Sit still.""",f
27651,Her self-control was slipping away from her; she struggled to be free of that hateful hand.,f

27653,"Let me go!""",f
27654,"""When you have given me your answer, sweetheart.""",f

27662,"""Think carefully before you answer; were it not better to marry me with all honour than to--""  ""You devil!"" she panted, and looked wildly round for some means of escape.",f
27663,"The long window was open, she knew, for the curtain blew out into the room.",f
27664,But his Grace was between it and her.,f
27665,"""You begin to think better of it, child?",f

27668,"In truth,"" he took a pinch of snuff, ""in truth, it matters not to me whether you will be a bride or no.""",f
27669,With a sudden movement she wrenched herself free and darted to the window.,f
27670,"In a flash he was up and had caught her as she reached it, swinging her round to face him.",f
27671,"""Not so fast, my dear.",f
27672,"You do not escape me so.""",f
27673,"His arm was about her waist, drawing her irresistibly towards him.",f

27680,"For one instant he held her so, and then swiftly bent his head and pressed his lips to hers.",f
27681,She could neither struggle nor cry out.,f
27682,"A deadly faintness assailed her, and she could scarcely breathe.",f
27683,"""By God, it is too late!"" he swore.",f
27684,"""You had best give in, madam--nought can avail you now.""",f
27685,And then the unexpected happened.,f
27686,"Even as in her last desperate effort to free herself she moaned the name of him whom she deemed hundreds of miles away across the sea, a crisp voice, vibrating with a species of cold fury, sounded directly behind them.",f
27687,"""You delude yourself, Belmanoir,"" it said with deadly quiet.",f
27688,With an oath Tracy released the girl and wheeled to face the intruder.,f
27689,"Framed by the dark curtains, drawn sword in hand, murder in his blue eyes, stood my lord.",f
27690,"Tracy's snarl died slowly away as he stared, and a look of blank amazement took its place.",f
27691,"Diana, almost unable to believe her eyes, dizzy with the suddenness of it all, stumbled blindly towards him, crying:  ""Thank God!",f
27692,Thank God!,f
27693,"Oh, Jack!""",f
27694,"He caught her in his arms, drawing her gently to the couch.",f
27695,"""Dear heart, you never doubted I should come?""",f
27696,"""I thought you in France!"" she sobbed, and sank down amongst the cushions.",f
27697,Carstares turned to meet his Grace.,f
27698,Tracy had recovered from the first shock of surprise and was eyeing him though his quizzing glass.,f
27699,"""This is an unexpected pleasure, my lord,"" he drawled with easy insolence.",f
27700,"Diana started at the mode of address and looked up at Carstares, bewildered.",f
27701,"""I perceive your sword in the corner behind you, your Grace!"" snapped Jack, and flung over to the door, twisting the key round in the lock and slipping it into his breeches pocket.",f
27702,"To Diana he was as a stranger, with no laugh in the glittering blue eyes, and none of the almost finicking politeness that usually characterised his bearing.",f
27703,"He was very white, with lips set in a hard straight line, and his nostrils slightly expanded.",f
27704,His Grace shrugged a careless refusal.,f
27705,"""My dear Carstares, why should I fight you?"" he inquired, seemingly not in the least annoyed by the other's intrusion.",f
27706,"""I had anticipated that answer, your Grace.",f
27707,"So I brought _this_!""",f
27708,"As he spoke Jack drove the sword he held into the wood floor, where it stayed, quivering.",f
27709,Nonchalantly Tracy took it in his hand and glanced at the hilt.,f
27710,"His fingers tightened on it convulsively, and he shot a piercing glance at Jack.",f
27711,"""I am entirely at your service,"" he said very smoothly, and laid the sword on the table.",f
27712,"Some of the glare died out of my lord's eyes, and a little triumphant smile curved the corners of his mouth.",f
27713,"Quickly he divested himself of his fine velvet coat, his waistcoat and his scabbard, and pulled off the heavy riding boots, caked with mud.",f
27714,"He proceeded to tuck up his ruffles, awaiting his Grace's convenience.",f
27715,"As one in a dream, Diana saw the table pushed back, the paces measured, and heard the ring of steel against steel.",f
27716,"My lord opened the attack after a few moments' cautious circling, lunging swiftly and recovering, even as the Duke countered and delivered a lightning _riposte en quinte_.",f
27717,"My lord parried gracefully in tierce, and chuckled softly to himself.",f
27718,"With parted lips and wide eyes, the girl on the couch watched each fresh lunge.",f
27719,"A dozen times it seemed as though Carstares must be run through, but each time, by some miraculous means, he regained his opposition, and the Duke's blade met steel.",f
27720,"Once, indeed, thrusting in _quarte_, Tracy's point, aimed too high, flashed above the other's guard and ripped the cambric shirt at the sleeve.",f
27721,"My lord retired his foot nimbly, parried, and _riposted_ with a straight thrust, wrist held high, before Tracy could recover his opposition.",f
27722,"The blades clashed as forte met foible, and my lord lunged straight at his opponent's breast.",f
27723,"Diana shut her eyes, expecting every moment to hear the dull thud of Tracy's body as it should fall to the ground.",f
27724,"It did not come, but instead there sounded a confused stamping, and scraping of blades, and she looked again to find the Duke disengaging over my lord's supple wrist and being parried with the utmost ease and dexterity.",f
27725,"Carstares knew that he would not be able to last long, however.",f
27726,"His shoulder, fretted by the long ride, was aching intolerably, and his wrist seemed to have lost some of its cunning.",f
27727,"He was conscious of a singing in his head which he tried, in vain, to ignore.",f
27728,But his eyes glowed and sparkled with the light of battle and the primitive lust to kill.,f
27729,"The Duke was fencing with almost superhuman skill, moving heavily and deliberately, seemingly tireless.",f
27730,"Carstares, on the other hand, was as swift and light as a panther, grace in every turn of his slim body.",f
27731,"He feinted suddenly inside the arm, deceiving the parade of tierce.",f
27732,"His Grace fell back a pace, parrying in _quarte_, and as John with a quick twist changed to _quarte_ also and the blades crossed, Tracy lunged forward the length of his arm, and a deep red splash stained the whiteness of my lord's sleeve at the shoulder.",f
27733,"Diana gave a choked cry, knowing it to be the old wound, and the Duke's blade came to rest upon the ground.",f
27734,"""You are--satisfied?"" he asked coolly, but panting a little.",f
27735,"My lord reeled slightly, controlled himself and brushed his left hand across his eyes.",f
27736,"""On guard!"" was all he replied, ignoring a pleading murmur from the girl.",f
27737,"Tracy shrugged, meeting Carstares' blade with his, and the fight went on.",f
27738,"Tracy's eyes were almost shut, it appeared to Diana, his chin thrust forward, his teeth gripping the thin lower lip.",f
27739,"To her horror she saw that Carstares was breathing in gasps, and that his face was ashen in hue.",f
27740,"It was torture to her to sit impotent, but she held herself in readiness to fly to his rescue should the need arise.",f
27741,"Suddenly my lord feinted on both sides of the arm and ripped open the Duke's sleeve, causing a steady trickle of blood to drip down on to the floor.",f
27742,"Tracy took no notice, but countered so deftly that John's blade wavered, and he staggered back.",f
27743,"For an instant it seemed as though the end had come, but somehow he steadied himself, recovering his guard.",f
27744,"Diana was on her feet now, nearly as white as her lover, her hands pressed to her breast.",f
27745,"She saw that John's point was no longer so purposeful, and the smile had gone from his lips.",f
27746,"They were parted now, the upper one rigid, and a deep furrow cut into his brow.",f
27747,"Then, startling in the stillness of the great house, came the clanging of a bell, pulled with some violence.",f
27748,"Carstares' white lips moved soundlessly, and Diana, guessing it to be her father, moved, clinging to the wall, towards the door.",f
27749,"A moment later along the passage came the sound of steps; a gay, boisterous voice was raised, followed by a deeper, graver one.",f
27750,"His Grace's face became devilish in its expression, but Carstares took no notice, seeming not to hear.",f
27751,Only he thrust with such skill that his Grace was forced to fall back a pace.,f
27752,"The loud voices demanded to know what was toward in the locked room, and Diana, knowing that my lord was nearly spent, beat upon the panels.",f
27753,"""Quickly, quickly!"" she cried.",f
27754,"""Break through, for heaven's sake, whoever you are!",f
27755,"'Tis locked!""",f
27756,"""Good Gad!",f
27757,"'tis a woman!"" exclaimed the voice.",f
27758,"""Listen, Dick!--why--why--'tis a fight!""",f
27759,"""Oh, be _quick_!"" implored poor Diana.",f
27760,"And then came the deeper voice: ""Stand away, madam, we will burst the lock.""",f
27761,"She moved quickly aside, turning her attention once more to the duel by the window, as Andrew flung his shoulder against the stout wood.",f
27762,"At the third blow the lock gave, the door flew wide, and Lord Andrew was precipitated into the room.",f
27763,"And the two by the window fought on unheeding, faster and faster.",f
27764,"""Well, I'm damned!"" said Andrew, surveying them.",f
27765,"He walked forward interestedly, and at the same moment caught sight of Jack's face.",f
27766,"He stared in amazement, and called to Richard.",f
27767,"""Good Lord!",f
27768,Here!,f
27769,Dick!,f
27770,Come here!,f
27771,"Surely it's--_who_ is that man?""",f
27772,"Diana saw the tall gentleman, so like her lover in appearance, step forward to the young rake's side.",f
27773,The next events happened in a flash.,f
27774,"She heard a great cry, and before she had time to know what he was doing, Richard had whipped his sword from its scabbard and had struck up the two blades.",f
27775,"In that moment the years rolled back, and, recognising his brother, Jack gasped furiously:  ""Damn--you--Dick!",f
27776,"Out--of--the way!""",f
27777,"Tracy stood leaning on his sword, watching, his breath coming in gasps, but still with that cynical smile on his lips.",f
27778,"Richard, seeing that his brother would fly at the Duke again, closed with him, struggling to wrest the rapier from his weakened grasp.",f
27779,"""You fool, John, leave go!",f
27780,"Leave go, I say!""",f
27781,With a twist he had the sword in his hand and sent it spinning across the room as without a sound my lord crumpled up and fell with a thud to the floor.,f
27782,"CHAPTER XXVIII  IN WHICH WHAT THREATENED TO BE TRAGEDY TURNS TO COMEDY   With a smothered cry Diana flew across the room to where my lord lay in a pitiful little heap, but before her was Richard.",f
27783,"He fell on his knees beside the still figure, feeling for the wound.",f
27784,"Diana, on the other side, looked across at him.",f
27785,"""'Tis his shoulder, sir--an old wound.",f
27786,"Oh, he is not--he cannot be--_dead_?""",f
27787,Richard shook his head dumbly and gently laid bare the white shoulder.,f
27788,"The wound was bleeding very slightly, and they bound it deftly betwixt them, with their united handkerchiefs and a napkin seized from the table.",f
27789,"""'Tis exhaustion, I take it,"" frowned Richard, his hand before the pale lips.",f
27790,"""He is breathing still.""",f
27791,"Over her shoulder Diana shot an order:  ""One of you men, please fetch water and cognac!""",f
27792,"""At once, madam!"" responded Andrew promptly, and hurried out.",f
27793,"She bent once more over my lord, gazing anxiously into his face.",f
27794,"""He will live?",f
27795,You--are sure?,f
27796,"He--he must have rid all the way from Maltby--for me!""",f
27797,"She caught her breath on a sob, pressing one lifeless hand to her lips.",f
27798,"""For you, madam?""",f
27799,Richard looked an inquiry.,f
27800,She blushed.,f
27801,"""Yes--he--we--I--""  ""I see,"" said Richard gravely.",f
27802,She nodded.,f
27803,"""Yes, and--and the Duke--caught me, and--brought me here--and--and then _he_ came--and saved me!""",f
27804,"The air blowing in from the window stirred the ruffles of my lord's shirt, and blew a strand of her dark hair across Diana's face.",f
27805,She caught it back and stared at Richard with a puzzled air.,f
27806,"""Pardon me, sir--but you are so like him!""",f
27807,"""I am his brother,"" answered Richard shortly.",f
27808,Her eyes grew round with surprise.,f
27809,"""His _brother_, sir?",f
27810,"I never knew Mr. Carr had a brother!""",f
27811,"""Mr.--who?"" asked Richard.",f
27812,"""Carr.",f
27813,"It is not his name, is it?",f
27814,"I heard the Duke call him Carstares--and--my lord.""",f
27815,"""He is the Earl of Wyncham,"" answered Richard, stretching out a hand to relieve Andrew of the jug of water he was proffering.",f
27816,"""Good--gracious!"" gasped Diana.",f
27817,"""B-but he said he was a highwayman!""",f
27818,"""Quite true, madam.""",f
27819,"""True?",f
27820,"But how--how ridiculous--and how like him!""",f
27821,"She soaked a handkerchief in the water, and bathed my lord's forehead.",f
27822,"""He is not coming to in the least,"" she said nervously.",f
27823,"""You are sure 'tis not--not--""  ""Quite.",f
27824,He'll come round presently.,f
27825,"You said he had ridden far?""",f
27826,"""He must have, sir--I wish he were not so pale--he was staying with the O'Haras at Maltby.""",f
27827,"""What?",f
27828,"The O'Haras?""",f
27829,"""Yes--and he must have ridden from there--and his wound still so tender!""",f
27830,Again she kissed the limp hand.,f
27831,"Over by the window his Grace, his breath recovered, was eyeing Andrew through his quizzing-glass.",f
27832,"""May I inquire what brings you here?"" he asked sweetly.",f
27833,"""And why you saw fit to bring the saintly Richard?""",f
27834,"""I came because it suited me to do so.",f
27835,"I never dreamed you were here--'Pon my soul, I did not!""",f
27836,"""Where then did you think I was?""",f
27837,"""Never thought about you at all, my dear fellow.",f
27838,"I'm not your squire.""",f
27839,"""Why is Richard here?""",f
27840,"""Lord, what a catechism!",f
27841,He is here because he brought me with him on his way to Wyncham.,f
27842,"Have you any objection?""",f
27843,"""It would be useless,"" shrugged Tracy.",f
27844,"""Have I killed that young fool?""",f
27845,Andrew looked him over in disgust.,f
27846,"""No, you have not.",f
27847,"You have barely touched him, thanks be.""",f
27848,"""Dear me!",f
27849,"Why this sudden affection for Carstares?""",f
27850,"Andrew swung round on his heel, remarking over his shoulder:  ""He may be a cheat, but he's a damned fine fellow.",f
27851,"By Gad! he nearly pinked you as I entered!""",f
27852,He chuckled at the memory of that glorious moment.,f
27853,"""He nearly pinked me a dozen times,"" replied Tracy, binding his arm round more tightly.",f
27854,"""He fights like ten devils.",f
27855,"But he was fatigued.""",f
27856,He followed Andrew across the room and stood looking down at his unconscious foe.,f
27857,Diana's eyes challenged him.,f
27858,"""Stand back, your Grace!",f
27859,"You have no more to do here!""",f
27860,He drew out his snuff-box and took a pinch.,f
27861,"""So that is how the matter lies, my dear.",f
27862,"I did not know that.""",f
27863,"""You pretend that it would have made a difference in your treatment of me?""",f
27864,"""Not the slightest, child,"" he replied, shutting the box with a snap.",f
27865,"""It has merely come as a slight surprise to me.",f
27866,"It seems he has the luck this round.""",f
27867,He walked away again as another great bell-peal sounded through the house.,f
27868,"Andrew, pouring cognac into a glass, paused with bottle held in mid-air.",f
27869,"""Thunder and turf!",f
27870,We are like to be a party!,f
27871,"Who now?""",f
27872,"He set the glass down and lounged out of the room, bottle in hand.",f
27873,"They heard him give an astonished cry and a loud laugh, and the next moment O'Hara strode into the room, booted and spurred and enveloped in a heavy surcoat.",f
27874,He came swiftly upon the little group about my lord and went down on one knee beside him.,f
27875,His eyes seemed to take in everyone at a glance.,f
27876,Then he looked across at Richard.,f
27877,"""Is he alive?""",f
27878,"Richard nodded, not meeting the hard, anxious gaze.",f
27879,O'Hara bent over his friend.,f
27880,"""He has been wounded?""",f
27881,Diana answered this.,f
27882,"""Only slightly, Sir Miles, but 'twas his shoulder again.",f
27883,"He was tired after the ride--Mr. Carstares thinks he has fainted from exhaustion.""",f
27884,"O'Hara very gently slipped one arm beneath my lord's shoulders and the other under his knees, rising with him as easily as if he were carrying a baby.",f
27885,"He walked over to the couch, lowering his burden on to the cushions that Diana placed to receive him.",f
27886,"""He will be easier there,"" he said, and looked across at her.",f
27887,"""Ye are quite safe, child?""",f
27888,"""Quite--quite--He came just in time--and fought for me.""",f
27889,She dabbed openly at her eyes.,f
27890,"""I--I love him so, Sir Miles--and now I hear that he is an Earl!"" she sighed.",f
27891,"""Well, child, 'twill make no difference, I take it.",f
27892,"I hope he'll make ye happy.""",f
27893,She smiled through her tears very confidently.,f
27894,"O'Hara turned and faced Richard, who was standing a little in the rear, watching his brother's face.",f
27895,He met O'Hara's scathing look squarely.,f
27896,"""Well?""",f
27897,"""Nought,"" answered the Irishman cuttingly, and walked over to where Lord Andrew was arguing hotly with his brother.",f
27898,Carstares returned to my lord's side and stood looking silently down at him.,f
27899,Diana suddenly gave a little joyful cry.,f
27900,"""He is coming round!",f
27901,He moved his head!,f
27902,"Oh, Jack, my dear one, look at me!""",f
27903,She bent over him with eyes alight with love.,f
27904,My lord's eyelids flickered and opened.,f
27905,For a moment he stared at her.,f
27906,"""Why--Diana!""",f
27907,She took his head between her hands and kissed him full on the mouth.,f
27908,Then she raised his head to look into the blue eyes.,f
27909,My lord's arm crept round her and held her tight against him.,f
27910,After a moment she disengaged herself and stood aside.,f
27911,"Jack's eyes, still a little bewildered, fell upon his brother.",f
27912,He struggled up on his elbow.,f
27913,"""Am I dreaming?",f
27914,"_Dick_!""",f
27915,His voice was full of a great joy.,f
27916,"Richard went quickly to him, trying to put him back on the cushions.",f
27917,"""My dear Jack--no, no--lie still!""",f
27918,"""Lie still?"" cried my lord, swinging his feet to the ground.",f
27919,"""Not a bit of it!",f
27920,"I am well enough, but a trifle dizzy.",f
27921,How in thunder did you come here?,f
27922,Surely 'twas you knocked up my sword?,f
27923,Yes?,f
27924,Interfering young cub!,f
27925,"Give me your arm a minute!""",f
27926,"""But why do you want to get up?"" pleaded a soft voice in his ear.",f
27927,"""So that I can take you in my arms, sweetheart,"" he answered, and proceeded to do so.",f
27928,"Then his glance, wandering round the room, alighted on the heated group by the table;",f
27929,"Andrew vociferously indignant, Tracy coolly sarcastic, and O'Hara furious.",f
27930,"""Tare an' ouns!"" ejaculated my lord.",f
27931,"""Where _did_ they all spring from?""",f
27932,"""I don't quite know!"" laughed Diana.",f
27933,"""Sir Miles came a few minutes ago--the other gentleman came with Mr. Carstares.""",f
27934,"""Ay, I remember him--'tis Andrew, eh, Dick?",f
27935,Zounds! how he has grown!,f
27936,But what in the world are they all fighting over?,f
27937,Miles!,f
27938,"Miles, I say!""",f
27939,"O'Hara wheeled round, surprised.",f
27940,"""Oho!",f
27941,"Ye are up, are ye.""",f
27942,He crossed to his side.,f
27943,"""Then sit down!""",f
27944,"""Since you are all so insistent, I will.",f
27945,"How did you come here?""",f
27946,"O'Hara went round to the back of the couch to arrange a cushion beneath the hurt shoulder, and leaned his arms upon the back, looking down with a laugh in his eyes.",f
27947,"""Faith, I rode!""",f
27948,"""But how did you know?",f
27949,"Where--""  ""'Twas all on account of that young rascal David,"" he said.",f
27950,"""Molly fretted and fumed all the way to the Frasers, vowing the child would be neglected, and what not, and we'd not been in the house above an hour or so, when up she jumps and says she knows that _something_ has happened at home, and nothing will suffice but that I must drive her back.",f
27951,We arrived just as Beauleigh was setting out.,f
27952,"He told us the whole tale, and of course I had Blue Peter saddled in the twinkling of an eye and was off after ye.",f
27953,"But, what with taking wrong turns and me horse not happening to be made of lightning, I couldn't arrive until now.""",f
27954,"""You cannot have been so long after me,"" said Jack.",f
27955,"""For I wasted full half-an-hour outside here, trying to find an opening in the hedge for Jenny to get through.",f
27956,She is now stalled in a shed at the bottom of the lawn with my cloak over her.,f
27957,"I'll swear she's thirsty, too.""",f
27958,"""I'll see to that,"" promised O'Hara.",f
27959,"Andrew came across the room and bowed awkwardly to my lord, stammering a little.",f
27960,Carstares held out his hand.,f
27961,"""Lord, Andy!",f
27962,"I scarce knew you!""",f
27963,"After a moment's hesitation, Andrew took the outstretched hand and answered, laughingly.",f
27964,"But my lord had not failed to notice the hesitation, short though it had been.",f
27965,"""I--beg your pardon.",f
27966,"I had forgot,"" he said stiffly.",f
27967,"Andrew sat down beside him, rather red about the ears.",f
27968,"""Oh, stuff, Jack!",f
27969,"I'm a clumsy fool, but I did not mean that!""",f
27970,Richard stepped forward into the full light of the candles.,f
27971,"""If you will all listen to me one moment, I shall be greatly obliged,"" he said steadily.",f
27972,Lord John started forward.,f
27973,"""Dick!"" he cried, warningly, and would have gone to him, but for O'Hara's hand on his shoulder, dragging him back.",f
27974,"""Ah, now, be aisy,"" growled Miles.",f
27975,"""Let the man say it!""",f
27976,"""Hold your tongue, O'Hara!",f
27977,"Dick, wait one moment!",f
27978,"I want to speak to you!""",f
27979,Richard never glanced at him.,f
27980,"""I am about to tell you something that should have been told--seven years ago--""  ""Once and for all, I forbid it!"" snapped my lord, trying to disengage himself from O'Hara's grip.",f
27981,Miles leant over him.,f
27982,"""See here, me boy, if ye don't keep a still tongue in your head, it's meself that'll be gagging you, and that's that!""",f
27983,My lord swore at him.,f
27984,Diana laid a gentle hand on his arm.,f
27985,"""Please, John!",f
27986,Please be still!,f
27987,"Why should not Mr. Carstares speak?""",f
27988,"""You don't know what he would do!"" fumed Jack.",f
27989,"""In fact, Miss Beauleigh, Sir Miles and Andrew are completely in the dark,"" drawled the Duke.",f
27990,"""Shall I tell the tale, Richard?""",f
27991,"""Thank you, I shall not require your assistance,"" was the cold rejoinder.",f
27992,"""But I must ask you to be quiet, John.""",f
27993,"""I will not!",f
27994,"You must n--""  ""That will do,"" decided O'Hara, and placed a relentless hand over his mouth.",f
27995,"""Go on, Carstares!""",f
27996,"""For the sake of Miss Beauleigh, I will tell you that seven years ago my brother and I went to a card-party.",f

27998,He took the blame.,f
27999,He has borne it ever since because I was too much a coward to confess.,f
28000,"That is all I have to say.""",f
28001,"""'Twas for that ye wanted to see me on Friday?"" shot out O'Hara.",f

28004,"""H'm!",f
28005,"I'm glad ye had decided to play the man's part for once!""",f
28006,With a furious oath Jack wrenched himself free and rounded on his friend.,f
28007,"""You take too much upon yourself, O'Hara!""",f
28008,He rose unsteadily and walked to Richard's side.,f
28009,"""Dick has told you much, but not all.",f
28010,You none of you know the reasons we had for acting as we did.,f
28011,But you know him well enough to believe that it needed very strong reasons to induce him to allow me take the blame.,f
28012,"If anyone has aught to say in the matter, I shall be glad if he will say it to me--now!""",f
28013,"His eyes flashed menacingly as they swept the company, and rested for an instant on O'Hara's unyielding countenance.",f
28014,Then he turned and held out his hand to his brother with his own peculiarly wistful smile.,f

28017,He grasped the unwilling hand.,f

28341,"""You are quite wrong.",f
28342,The dear old General would rise from his grave if I gave away his present.,f

28362,"Do you know every now and then she used to burst out into a soft little laugh all to herself just because she was so happy, and I was so scrumptiously pleased to hear it, that I swallowed an extra gallery and did another old ruin without letting her see how sleepy it made me.""",f
28363,"""But she was with you to do as you liked, I thought!""",f
28364,"""Oh, to see Crumpet laugh was what I really enjoyed!",f

28370,"""What impudence!""",f
28371,"""Oh, no, and he didn't do it to me personally, because he told Crumpet I never gave him the tiniest chance, but he did it to her instead!",f
28372,"Wasn't it funny, and she wept bitterly when she told me, she thought it was her fault.""",f
28373,"""And what answer did you give him?""",f
28374,This time his companion smiled.,f

28407,"""Good heavens!",f
28408,"What for?""",f
28409,"""I was a bit surprised too, and he laughed and said, 'Don't be afraid, they are not suitors,' then I scolded him and said he knew I never thought of such things.",f
28410,"Well, then he explained that as I was coming into so much money--and do you know somehow it's a lot more than they expected--I must have a secretary, because it would take all my time and strength to open the letters.",f

28418,"""Did he consent?""",f
28419,"""No! he was afraid I should tell of him I think, anyhow I had to choose, and there was one with an Australian uncle who recommended him highly.",f

28457,"But as every human being changes for better or for worse, there was something even more displeasing than formerly in Lady Dove's face.",f
28458,"She was a prey--and had been ever since the memorable day when she heard the news of Toney's good fortune--to the demon of jealousy, who never leaves his victims many peaceful moments, and just now he was her constant visitor.",f
28459,"Toney had been very little at Aldersfield, because Sir Evas and Mr. Staines, the lawyer, had insisted on her having foreign advantages, and Lady Dove had eagerly acquiesced.",f
28460,"The very sight of Toney increased her malady, but as no one knew this it had been decided that Toney should, for the present, live with her uncle and aunt, for everyone recognised that she had not learnt the use of money, and that it was not safe for her to be left quite unprotected.",f
28461,"Strange to say Toney had not rebelled when she was told of this decision; she was very fond of her uncle, and though secretly she called Aunt Dove her ""cross,"" she meant to carry the burden bravely so that Sir Evas should be able to be ""off duty"" as often as possible.",f
28462,The other plans that had been maturing in the mind of Harum Scarum were for the present kept a secret.,f
28463,"Before Toney could take off her habit she was bidden to come and see Mr. Staines in her uncle's study, so she and Trick hastily ran in, and indeed, Trick, having got jambed between her feet, nearly succeeded in making his mistress tumble--as it was, she lurched into the room in a most undignified manner.",f

28475,"Perhaps Toney's fortune had brought him more happiness than to anyone else, for being her guardian, he had been fully occupied during her minority, and the work had been a real pleasure and occupation for him.",f
28476,"Besides this, once a year he had got a month--not in prison, but with Toney abroad, and what good times those had been, even though he always had to pay handsomely for them on his return home.",f

28497,"""Of course you need not, but it is more business-like to keep accounts,"" said the lawyer sternly, ""and to come to details, it would be better to give Lady Dove the same amount as she has had, as long as you live here.""",f
28498,"""Of course.",f
28499,"You'll do that, Mr. Staines, and if you double it, perhaps she'll not dislike me so much.""",f

28562,Toney interposed.,f
28563,"""But, Aunt Dove, I'm godmother to both the children; you'll see what good times they'll have!",f
28564,It's awfully good of my Chum to have children I can play with.,f
28565,"Oh dear, I've got to feel grown-up, Mr. Staines says, but just for this evening I'll still be young.""",f
28566,"""Tea is coming in; sit down, Anne Faber, and kindly pour it out.",f
28567,"That tiresome Grossman will never come in before five, as she insists on taking a walk till then.",f
28568,"I really must give her notice, only one is afraid of getting something worse.",f
28569,"You should _never_ have married, Anne Faber.",f
28570,"I got you quite into my ways, and since you left I've never had anyone who could write and read as you did.""",f
28571,"""I'm very sorry you are not suited,"" murmured Mrs. Faber, beginning to make the tea whilst Toney flew at the kettle; but at that moment a tall angular woman appeared, and gave a terrible look at Lady Dove and at the other two, as she said tartly,  ""It is five minutes to five;",f
28572,"I am _never_ late, Lady Dove, and, as you know, I never allow anyone to do my work.",f
28573,"Excuse me----""  ""I wish you would not argue, Grossman.",f
28574,"Miss Whitburn and Mrs. Faber are quite equal to making tea if I choose to ask them;"" but then the door opened, and Sir Evas and the lawyer entered and stopped further bickering between Lady Dove and her companion.",f
28575,"""Oh, Toney,"" whispered Sir Evas, ""it's tartaric acid, I see; that woman's got a devil of a temper, and your Aunt Dove is really learning patience.""                                                                    ""Oh!"" exclaimed Mrs. Faber later on, when Toney threw open her old sitting-room door where the poor companion had had such miserable hours.",f
28576,It was as comfortable as modern comfort bought with modern money could make it.,f
28577,Then the little woman fairly sat down and cried.,f
28578,"""Gracious stars!",f
28579,"I meant to make you laugh, Crumpet!",f
28580,"Oh, gee! you see how hard it is to do right!""",f
28581,Mrs. Faber quickly dried her tears and smiled.,f
28582,"""I can't help thinking of all my happiness now and comparing it with the past, and it's all owing to you, Toney.",f
28583,"Do you remember----""  ""Of course I do.",f
28584,"What mostest fun we had when I dressed in your grandmother's garments, and then when your dear Henry came!""",f
28585,"""When I compare my past and my present I feel how ungrateful I am!""",f
28586,"""Nonsense, Chum, you _never_ were ungrateful!",f
28587,"But look here, I got aunt's leave to furbish up this room a bit so that you shouldn't be reminded of the old order.",f
28588,"I knew you would prefer our being together up here, and I've got lots to tell you.",f
28589,"First, I've had some dresses made for you, so that you shouldn't be put to any expense for _my_ party.""",f
28590,"Toney quickly opened a wooden box and displayed the most lovely dresses imaginable, lovely because suitable and perfectly simple.",f
28591,"One was a dinner dress of pale mauve silk, just suited to Mrs. Faber's delicate complexion, and the other was a white liberty silk dress for the ball.",f
28592,Mrs. Faber gasped.,f
28593,"""Oh no, Toney! it's impossible!",f
28594,"They must have cost ever so much money, and I don't want people to say that I--I sponge upon you.""",f
28595,"""There you are again, Crumpet!",f
28596,"'People to say,' I did think that you'd rise above that.",f
28597,"Remember Henry's pleasure--and mine!""",f
28598,"""Henry may not think it right!""",f
28599,"""Look here, Chum, let's be serious just for one minute and listen.",f
28600,"You know I've an awful lot of money, fifty thousand a year!""",f
28601,Mrs. Faber gasped again.,f
28602,"""It's a secret, by the way, but not from you.",f
28603,"Well, when I first heard it I did what Pups would have done, I just dedicated it all to other people that wanted it, and I didn't guess it would be such hard work as I see it will be.",f
28604,"After to-morrow I shall work like a Kanaka, but just for this week I'm going to please myself and not think if it's wise, or if it's political economy, or all the things I've been trying to learn to fit myself for spending this stuff.""",f
28605,"""It will be too much work for you, dear!""",f
28606,"""Yes, it's awful! but I'm going to keep just enough to dress like Pups' daughter, because that's what I am.",f
28607,"You know Aunt Dove never thought me fit to live here, and I'm not yet changed, you see!",f
28608,"And there shall always be enough to take people abroad who want it every year, you, too, of course among the number, for you'll get so parochial if you don't rub about a little, that you must travel, and then the rest will have to be 'wisely distributed,' as Mr. Hales says.",f
28609,"Ouf!""",f
28610,"""Oh, dear, it is too much work,"" repeated Mrs. Faber, gently feeling the dinner dress between her fingers; she had never had a gown like that before, and how proud Henry would be of her appearance!",f
28611,"""So, Crumpet, don't ever think of me as rich.",f
28612,"I shan't be, I'll have to screw sometimes on the allowance I'll make myself, but that's for discipline.",f
28613,"Aunt Dove will have a nice slice of cake to make her happy--if she can be--and well, that's all, now remember I'm just the same old Toney with all her faults as of old, and too bad for anyone to love for herself, Aunt Dove says so--except you always, Crumpet.",f
28614,"Now I'll ring for Rose to help us to dress.""",f
28615,"""Where's your dress, dear Toney?"" asked Mrs. Faber, going across to Toney's simple bedroom on which no money had been spent to embellish it.",f
28616,"""It's here.",f
28617,"You see, Chum, it's only white muslin, but it's brand new and looks all right.""",f
28618,"""Oh, Toney, much too simple, why anyone might wear that!""",f
28619,"""Well, I _am_ disappointed in you!",f
28620,"Didn't I explain quite straight I'm only Toney, and not rich, if I dressed up smart--which you know I hate any way--people would think I was rich.",f
28621,I believe you would like me to wear a dress of bank-notes sewed together.,f
28622,"I did think you weren't worldly!""",f
28623,"""I'll try, dear, but when you make me wear such a lovely thing, though I'm only a poor clergyman's wife with three hundred a year, it doesn't seem quite----""  ""It's to please me!",f
28624,"Just for once I must have a fling, and after that I'll be as matter of fact as you like.""",f
28625,At this moment Rose appeared.,f
28626,"She had been kitchen-maid, but Toney had hunted her up and turned her into a lady's maid, as Lady Dove insisted on Toney's engaging such a personage, saying her own maid had as much as she could do with her own affairs.",f
28627,"Rose was supremely happy, but far more willing than capable, and Toney managed to do all her own toilet whilst she was getting Mrs. Faber into her dream dress.",f
28628,"Toney had begged her uncle that they should be by themselves at Aldersfield this evening, just to seem like old times, and he had agreed, though Mr. Staines, the London lawyer, was of course one of the small party.",f
28629,"Miss Grossman never appeared after the dinner bell had rung, and firmly refused any summons to the drawing-room after that meal, saying she had her own affairs to see after.",f
28630,"Her ladyship had been very angry of course, and relieved her feelings by grumbling to her husband.",f
28631,She was discharging her wrath at him this evening before going up to dress.,f
28632,"""Grossman has very erroneous ideas of her duty, Evas.",f
28633,It's preposterous to refuse to pour out the evening tea and to take out the cards or pick up my stitches.,f
28634,"I should never have engaged her if I could have guessed what she would be like.""",f
28635,"""Why don't you get rid of her, Melina?""",f
28636,"""How aggravating you can be, Evas, you know quite well the last woman drank, and the one before was deaf and heard all awry.",f
28637,"If I sent Grossman away, which I should dearly love to do, her successor would have a worse failing.""",f
28638,"""Yes, most likely,"" he answered.",f
28639,"""That's just like you, Evas, you never try to help me.""",f
28640,"""Shall I have a talk with her?""",f
28641,"""_You_ have a talk with Grossman!",f
28642,"Pray don't joke! she'd tell you to mind your own business; that woman is afraid of no one, positively no one!",f
28643,"I wish Faber would die, and then I could have Crump back again, for then she would be penniless.""",f
28644,"""And the two children?""",f
28645,"""Yes, it's really wicked of them!",f
28646,I should have to get them into asylums.,f
28647,"Most provoking, ever since Antonia stepped into the house everything has gone from bad to worse.",f
28648,"However, she is sure to get married soon for her money!""",f
28649,"""Did you ever think Lewis Waycott admired Toney?"" said Sir Evas, hoping to please his spouse by this suggestion.",f
28650,"""Lewis Waycott!",f
28651,He's going to marry his cousin Maud.,f
28652,Mrs. Hamilton arranged all that long ago.,f
28653,"But I dare say you are right, and he will throw up that nice girl for Toney's money bags.",f
28654,"After all we have done for her--and it's entirely through me she has this money, for I told the General the plain truth about her penniless condition--I think Antonia could show her gratitude more by imitating our English manners.",f
28655,"What's bred in the bone, I know, but she might at least pretend to be a lady.""",f
28656,"""Pretend!",f
28657,"You might know by this time that Toney can't pretend.""",f
28658,"""Oh, you men are all taken with a young girl, I know!",f
28659,"Duty goes to the wind when----""  But here Sir Evas slipped away to dress; now and then his manners failed entirely, and he did not always wait for the end of his wife's sentences.",f
28660,"This evening, as her ladyship walked upstairs, her familiar demon provided a new torture for her.",f
28661,"Suppose what Evas said were true, suppose Lewis Waycott fell in love with Antonia and married her and her fortune, his estate would benefit enormously, and the Waycotts would be a power in the county.",f
28662,"""Antonia shall certainly not marry Lewis Waycott,"" she said to herself, ""I can nip that in the bud--and I shall.""",f
28663,"Then, with a smile on her face, she rang for Rivett, who was as prim as formerly, but now she could no longer bully the companion, as Miss Grossman was fully able to keep her own position and to exact outward respect from the servants.",f
28664,"That evening in the drawing-room at Aldersfield, Toney's very presence seemed to shame the selfish stateliness of Lady Dove, for she had more than fulfilled the promise of beauty, though of a special kind.",f
28665,"Her face was radiant, and her beautiful hair seemed to crown the perfect outline of her head.",f
28666,"Her very simplicity of dress might have been premeditated, so entirely did it harmonize with the girl whose every motion was full of life and the beauty that comes from perfect unconsciousness of self.",f
28667,Certainly three of the people there were secretly speculating what fortunate man would win Toney's heart.,f
28668,"At present her heart was given to humanity, and had never experienced the personal feeling which may make or mar perfect womanhood, but which never passes without leaving its trace.",f
28669,"Mr. Staines made a formal bow to Lady Dove and offered his arm, whilst Toney looked at Sir Evas who hesitated.",f
28670,"""Of course, uncle, married ladies first,"" and Sir Evas offered his arm to the blushing Anne Faber, but thinking of Henry she determined to make the most of herself, and Toney would be close by, besides, abroad she and Sir Evas had become most friendly, and this was a wonderful transformation.",f
28671,Mr. Staines was so attentive to Lady Dove that the other three were allowed to enjoy themselves.,f
28672,"""Are the preparations all ready, uncle?",f
28673,"Did you see if the big barn was finally swept out, and if the rose wreaths were finished?""",f
28674,"""I assure you, Toney, I've worked myself to death.""",f
28675,"""And did you send out all the invitations I wrote?""",f
28676,"""Every one.",f
28677,I got Barnes and Jones to take them round a week ago.,f
28678,"I only hope your scrawls were readable!""",f
28679,"""I thought they would like it best, a personal invitation is much better, isn't it?""",f
28680,"""What did you say, Toney?"" asked Mrs. Faber.",f
28681,"""Miss Toney Whitburn will be much delighted if Mrs. Spratt will come and have a dinner and dance on October 28th, at Aldersfield House.",f
28682,"Dinner punctually at six o'clock, family included--babies taken care of.""",f
28683,"""But you'll have all the village!""",f
28684,"""All uncle's people, of course.",f
28685,Won't it be fun!,f
28686,Uncle and I planned it all weeks ago.,f
28687,"Didn't we, dear?""",f
28688,"""You planned it, Toney, and I said yes.",f
28689,"I know my duty!""",f
28690,"""But you were as excited as I was.",f
28691,You know you were!,f
28692,I do wish my dear General were here.,f
28693,"Do you think he and Pups will look on?""",f
28694,"""Well, I expect----  I shouldn't wonder,"" said poor Sir Evas, whose ethics of the world beyond were very hazy, ""or, perhaps they can see a long way off.""",f
28695,"""Pups said that there were no real lines of demarcation in nature, but, of course, you would not want everybody who's dead to crowd in.",f
28696,It's just a puzzle!,f
28697,The cook is excited too.,f
28698,"Oh, Chum, I've ordered the dinner as I'm going to pay all expenses, and you'll see.",f
28699,"It took a good deal of planning, but I didn't tell uncle all that, I was just a bit afraid he'd split on me.""",f
28700,"""I'm as dark as the grave, Toney!"" said Sir Evas laughing, ""but I must say I shall be glad when it's over.",f
28701,"One never knows with you----""  ""Are we all to dance together?"" asked Mrs. Faber.",f
28702,"""At first, but there's a ball in the big drawing-room for the people who don't care about the tenants, only they won't be half so lively.",f
28703,"Mr. Waycott's promised he'll be at the opening of my ball, and Dr. Latham, and, of course, you and uncle.",f
28704,I don't think Aunt Dove will care.,f
28705,She says poor people are not odoriferous.,f
28706,It comes from their clothes being rather old.,f
28707,"I wished we lived in the days of Henry IV., when every poor man had a fowl in his cooking-pot.""",f
28708,"""A fowl wouldn't go far with Charles Pipkin and his family,"" said Sir Evas, ""it did all very well for the Frenchies.""",f
28709,"""It is fortunate girls only come of age once in their lifetime,"" Lady Dove was saying.",f
28710,"""When I was young it meant a young lady was fully formed and educated, and her manners were irreproachable;",f
28711,"I fear we can't say that of Antonia, Mr. Staines.""",f
28712,"""All in due time, Lady Dove,"" was Mr. Staines' guarded answer.",f
28713,"""Really how horribly Grossman has arranged these flowers, and taken all my best roses too,"" exclaimed her ladyship.",f
28714,"""You were much more successful, Anne Faber.",f
28715,"It seems a pity you can no longer use your talents.""",f
28716,"""My husband is passionately fond of flowers, we always have some on the table,"" murmured Mrs. Faber.",f
28717,"""Indeed!",f
28718,It's a pity flowers are not edible.,f
28719,"Mr. Staines, how is Captain Stone.",f
28720,"He is another eccentric creature, and has not been to see us for a long time, but he asked for a bed to-morrow.""",f
28721,"""He told me of his intention.",f
28722,"He was very fond of his brother.""",f
28723,"""The General's will must have been a bitter pill to him,"" said Lady Dove smiling.",f
28724,"Mr. Staines saw clearly that it was Lady Dove who had swallowed the pill, and replied politely,  ""I know that the General asked his brother's consent, and Captain Stone thought all his brother did perfect.""",f
28725,"""Indeed! men are so deluded, I mean the old ones of course.",f
28726,"Lewis Waycott, our neighbour, is fast turning into the same kind of man.",f
28727,"He has become quite the farmer, don't you think so, Evas?""",f
28728,"""What, my dear, Lewis Waycott?",f
28729,"Yes, certainly, excellent fellow; sees after his cottages now, and is quite a model landlord.""                                                                      Toney was alone in the little bare simple room which had been hers on her first arrival at Aldersfield.",f
28730,"She sat down on the window-sill with Trick in her arms, and she looked back with wonder across the five years' interval since her arrival.",f
28731,"She remembered the terrible homesickness that had seized her in the stifling atmosphere of Aldersfield, but God had made her paths smooth for her since then, and now He was going to give her the great responsibility of wealth.",f
28732,"She did not feel the burden as much as an older woman might have done, for besides possessing the courage of youth, her mind was not complex.",f
28733,Her great ideas were simple enough after all--to give good times to all the needy people she came in contact with.,f
28734,"That had been her father's creed, and that should be hers.",f
28735,She had yet to find out that even this creed is not nearly as simple as it appears at first sight.,f
28736,"Toney's prayers were never very lengthy, but they came from her heart, and before she got into bed she laughed softly to herself as she examined a sheet of paper on which was written,  ""Toney's time-table, on her twenty-first birthday,"" thinking of the old time-table that had brought her into so much disgrace with Lady Dove.",f
28737,"This one had to begin early, for it was St.",f
28738,Simon and St.,f
28739,"Jude's Day, and before anyone but underlings were about, Toney stepped out of the house and began running across the park as if she were running for a wager, Trick panting after her.",f
28740,"She had to be in time for the eight o'clock early service, which Mr. Hales, despite small encouragement from his flock, never omitted on Saints' Days.",f
28741,"Lady Dove said it was ridiculous of him to have these early services, as she never went to them.",f
28742,"Mrs. Hales, Silvia, and an old servant, these formed all his congregation, till just as he was about to begin, Toney entered, panting audibly.",f
28743,"""Where two or three are gathered together there am I in the midst of them,"" thought the Vicar, and was not discouraged.",f
28744,"When the others hurried home, Toney still remained on her knees, till suddenly Trick pattered in to remind her that he was waiting for her, and Toney took the hint.",f
28745,The Vicar was also waiting for her outside.,f
28746,"""Oh!"" exclaimed Toney with her radiant smile, ""that is kind of you, I wanted to see you so much.""",f
28747,"""Many happy returns of the day, Toney,"" he said, holding her hand, then very simply he added, ""I have been praying for you.""",f
28748,"The Vicar was not ashamed of mentioning his prayers--had he not been ordained to prayer, and was it not his duty to wear his colours as bravely as did his former pupil?",f
28749,"""Thank you.",f

28825,"""The old General ought to have secured some controlling power for her.""",f
28826,"""She will pauperize the village,"" said Silvia, who was still pretty, but had now a little discontented expression on her face, and the reason was that Captain Nichols, a young penniless officer who admired her, and whom she loved, would not come forward, as he could not make up his mind to give up his own extravagances.",f
28827,"Without owning it to herself, Silvia was jealous of the once despised Harum Scarum.",f
28828,"Silvia's younger sister had boldly faced poverty, and gone to be a lady nurse, but was coming for two days at Toney's special request.",f
28829,"""When you get a present of a sovereign, Silvia, are you pauperized?"" said the Vicar smiling.",f
28830,"""It isn't often I do!""",f
28831,"""I think we may safely say Toney will not repeat this surprise.""",f
28832,"""Of course it is easy to be generous when you have heaps of money!",f
28833,"I wonder how much Toney has got,"" and Silvia heaved a little sigh.",f
28834,"""I rather pity her,"" said Mr. Hales gently.",f
28835,"""Lady Dove never says a kind word about her, at least to me.""",f
28836,"""I think Toney likes her inferiors best,"" added Silvia.",f
28837,"""I hear Mrs. Faber has come to stay at Aldersfield.",f
28838,"She must remember the time when she was only the poor companion.""",f
28839,"""We none of us received her very kindly,"" remarked the Vicar, cutting some bread, and then Silvia gave a quick glance at her brother's face.",f
28840,Was it possible that he admired Toney?,f
28841,"If he married her and her fortune, what great things might he not achieve for himself and his family!",f
28842,Silvia determined to say nothing more against Toney.,f
28843,Vague possibilities which she would have been ashamed to own aloud flitted through her mind.,f
28844,"""Anyhow, she is very, very generous, and I mean to enjoy the ball,"" she said in quite a cheerful voice.",f
28845,"Mrs. Hales was opening her letters and exclaimed suddenly,  ""Really that child!",f
28846,"Listen! dear boy.""",f
28847,"""MY DEAR MRS. HALES,  ""I always remember your kindness to the wild colt you allowed to come to your house.",f
28848,"It was awfully nice of you, and I don't want to do anything horrid in return, but it would give me so much pleasure if you would buy your ball dresses out of this cheque.",f
28849,"I know you are not rich, because Aunt Dove paid you for teaching me, but I know you and Mr. Hales would have done the same for me for nothing.",f
28850,I don't want to feel to-night that anyone is the poorer for my birthday party.,f
28851,Please accept my little present and don't be proud about it.,f
28852,Just for to-morrow I'm having a fling.,f
28853,"There's several little things I've heard you say you wanted, but it's nicer to get what one likes oneself, isn't it?",f
28854,Will you find something Mr. Hales would like.,f
28855,"Every now and then Pups bought me something just ridiculously beautiful, so that he might have the pleasure of seeing me wear it, but really these surprise presents were rather a trial to me, as he didn't know what girls appreciated.",f
28856,"Please think of me when you say your prayers to-morrow, as this money will give me a lot of trouble, but I don't mean to funk it.",f
28857,"""YOUR AFFECTIONATE TONEY.""",f
28858,"""What is the cheque?"" asked Silvia eagerly.",f
28859,She noticed that her name was not mentioned.,f
28860,Toney was too honest to thank those who had disliked her.,f
28861,"""A hundred pounds.",f
28862,"I cannot refuse it, it will help us so much; there's a new drawing-room carpet that I was puzzling how to get!""",f
28863,The Vicar laughed.,f

28867,"I had been thinking I was extravagant.""",f
28868,"""I'll go and meet Amy at the station,"" exclaimed Silvia.",f
28869,"""We can pay her journey now.",f
28870,"Oh dear, money is useful, however much Frank proclaims the blessings of poverty.""",f
28871,The Vicar never argued with Silvia.,f
28872,"He had often felt sorry his pretty sister could not have more advantages, and he knew all about Tom Nichols and the hopelessness of the love affair.",f
28873,"""We will give Toney a return of cheerful spirits,"" he said.",f
28874,"""I shall go down early to Aldersfield with Waycott.",f
28875,We have consulted how best to help her.,f
28876,I believe Lady Dove pretends to know nothing about it all.,f
28877,"Why can't people recognise their blessings?""",f
28878,"""Lady Dove's present blessing is Miss Crossman.",f
28879,"You told me to make friends with her, but I really could not.",f
28880,"She told me she preferred her own company when her duties were over, and she did not like to encroach on her walk and rest times,"" said Silvia.",f
28881,They all laughed.,f
28882,"""I wonder if Toney will break that crust of ice,"" said Mrs. Hales thoughtfully.",f
28883,"""Artificial ice is impenetrable!"" was the Vicar's answer.",f
28884,"Then they all went their various ways, but there was a warm glow in each of their hearts, though the reasons for it were different.                                                                      The great barn behind Aldersfield House was the scene of much bustle and work on this eventful morning.",f
28885,"Foremost among all the workers was Toney herself, dressed in a short serge dress covered with a big apron.",f
28886,"She looked the picture of happiness, and even Aunt Dove's cold congratulations at breakfast had not been able to damp her spirits.",f
28887,"Mrs. Faber was making ""button-holes,"" whilst Toney was arranging flowers in vases with her deft magic touch to adorn the long tables.",f
28888,"Men were putting up festoons among the dark rafters, and the brightest sunshine was pouring in at the door and windows.",f
28889,"""Won't it be lovely! and won't their eyes open!",f
28890,Gracious stars!,f
28891,"What's this?""",f
28892,"A large box was being wheeled in, and Lewis Waycott came behind it with an amused smile on his face.",f
28893,"""Many happy returns,"" he said, as Toney flew to receive him.",f
28894,"""I've brought you some flowers.",f
28895,"I know you're particular about having the best.""",f
28896,"Two men were soon unpacking the box, and displayed a wealth of glorious blossoms, mostly exotics.",f
28897,"""Oh!"" gasped Toney, ""but--where did you get them?""",f
28898,"""I sent Graham for them to London.",f
28899,"I thought your friends should see something new in the way of flowers!""",f
28900,"""That is awfully nice.",f
28901,I never thought of that.,f
28902,"It will give them something to talk about, and I was just at my wits' end for more flowers;",f
28903,"Aunt Dove doesn't like to denude her hot-houses, but oh, Mr. Waycott, just imagine, uncle went out very early and _stole_ some!",f
28904,"He did really, I saw him, but don't tell! and he sent them in as a present from Aunt Dove for my feast!",f
28905,"I'm sure she knew nothing about it, so I mustn't thank her.""",f
28906,"The two laughed heartily together, and then Lewis looked round at the transformed barn.",f
28907,"""Have you got my work marked out?""",f
28908,"""I should think so, but come round first and admire!",f
28909,Look at my birthday cake.,f
28910,It's all made of little cottages in sugar.,f
28911,"It's my idea!""",f
28912,"""However is it to be cut?""",f
28913,"""You'll help, won't you?",f
28914,"I just couldn't have got all ready without you, and your men have taken as deep an interest as our own.""",f
28915,"""Of course, the invitation amply rewards them----  By the way, Toney, I've got a personal present for you; will you accept it?""",f
28916,He dived into a pocket and brought out a small box.,f
28917,"Toney opened it and drew forth a locket surrounded with small diamonds, and within it was a beautifully painted miniature of Toney's father.",f
28918,The girl looked up suddenly and her eyes filled with tears.,f
28919,"""Oh, Pups!"" she gasped, ""how did you get it?""",f
28920,"""Is it like?",f
28921,Mrs. Faber helped me.,f
28922,"I believe she stole an old photograph you possess, and--you see your friends are all expert thieves!""",f
28923,"""I shall never forget this,"" she said, brushing the tears away with the back of her somewhat grimy hand, ""and I shall always think of you two together.",f
28924,I think the artist must have been just inspired.,f
28925,"If only _he_ could come this evening, he'd have gone round to everyone of the guests and said something jolly.""",f
28926,"""I'll try and take his place,"" said Lewis a little shyly, and then he seized a hammer and nails and was soon among the rafters with the other men.",f
28927,Sir Evas presently made his entrance and looked round.,f
28928,"""Why, Toney, this will be a fairy palace!",f
28929,"I see you have already put your aunt's flowers in water.""",f
28930,"""Yes, and look, uncle, at these leaves with them!",f
28931,I used to pick up the gold leaves when I was a tiny and bring them to Pups for his poor people.,f
28932,I really thought they were gold; but just see what Mr. Waycott has brought!,f
28933,"Beautiful flowers to remind me of home, and crowds of orchids for your people to talk about.",f
28934,Isn't it scrumptious of him?,f
28935,"He's done the real thinking.""",f
28936,"""Good heavens, Toney, it must have cost him----""  ""Oh, uncle, if you had grand visitors you'd think nothing of it, and poor folk are just as fond of flowers as 'ristocrats, now aren't they?""",f
28937,"""Well, really, I have never thought about it.""",f
28938,"""And look what he's given me,"" and Toney opened the locket.",f
28939,"""There aren't many men that would have thought of it, and besides, he's going to make himself awfully pleasant to our people to-night, and, uncle, you will too, won't you?""",f
28940,"""In so far as in me lieth, Toney,"" said Sir Evas doubtfully.",f
28941,"""Oh, yes, you can.",f
28942,Have you learnt that list of names I gave you?,f
28943,"I put them quite plain, a column for the men and women and a column for the children.",f
28944,"It took a deal of writing to get all the names of the children, you know, so I hope you've learnt them.""",f
28945,"""You don't write _very_ plain, Toney!""",f
28946,"""Oh, that's an excuse!"" laughed Toney, ""let me see, what's the name of Timothy Grant's fourth child?",f
28947,"He's your cowman, uncle, so you really _ought_ to know _his_ children.""",f
28948,"""Polly,"" answered Sir Evas, looking grave.",f
28949,"""Oh! why the eldest is Polly, there couldn't be two Pollys, you know.",f
28950,"It's Marthyann, all in one, Mrs. Grant declares, she says she 'giv it out herself to Mr. 'ales.'""  ""Is Marthyann coming, Toney, and shall I be expected to recognise her?""",f
28951,"""They'd just adore you if you were to go up straight to her and call her Marthyann, but it won't do if you go to the wrong one, so perhaps you'd better ask me first.""",f
28952,"""But I assure you, Toney, your list was longer than my arm; it would want a royal memory to attempt it!""",f
28953,"""I _think_ I've got them all right, but Jenny Varly's eldest boy is Tommy Varly, and John Todd's second boy is Tommy Todd, and they are cousins, and as like as two peas, and I do sometimes mistake them!",f
28954,"But, uncle, there are no drones here, as you aren't very handy with your fingers, can you hold that box of nails for Phil Smith?""",f
28955,"""Well, for a few minutes.",f
28956,"I've a lot to do this morning, and Mr. Staines is still requiring my services, and your new secretary is coming to-morrow, and your aunt is rather upset because the gardeners are all here, and----""  ""I've left her Miss Grossman,"" answered Toney laughing, ""she's a host in herself, and she told me she didn't hold by spoiling _poor_ people!",f
28957,Why it's just the poor we ought to spoil!,f
28958,"Don't you think so, uncle?""",f
28959,Sir Evas pretended not to hear as he did not want Toney to bring up his remarks against him at some future time.,f
28960,"He knew this was an inconvenient habit of hers, so he slipped out of the barn as soon as he could when she wasn't looking.",f
28961,The workers went on with all speed.,f
28962,All had to be done by five o'clock when the guests would begin to arrive.,f
28963,"""I suppose you have had to hire the knives and spoons,"" said Lewis, coming down for a moment to contemplate his work.",f
28964,"""Yes.",f
28965,"Uncle said I could have all the kitchen things, but--I--didn't want them, and Aunt Dove wouldn't hear of her plate being unearthed, so I've hired it all.""",f
28966,"""Not real plate!""",f
28967,Toney nodded.,f
28968,"""Yes, just real silver, and everything like lords and ladies, won't they be pleased?",f
28969,"Something to remember!""",f
28970,"""I hope it won't disappear, Toney!""",f
28971,"""How can you suggest anything so unkind!",f
28972,"You see the children have the other barn, and Mrs. Faber undertakes them.",f
28973,A child is always good with her.,f
28974,Isn't it odd?,f
28975,Do you see that Mr. Faber is hard at work there now with her?,f
28976,I shall want to cut myself in three pieces!,f
28977,"Oh, I am so happy!""",f
28978,"Lewis glancing at her face did not doubt her happiness, but he could not echo the speech.",f
28979,"Before Toney had become an heiress, Lewis had fallen in love with her, he had made her promise to give him something when he should ask for it, and then suddenly this terrible fortune had dropped down from the skies, and had set up a wall of division between him and the girl he admired as well as loved.",f
28980,"No girl in his estimation could approach Toney in all the qualities he so much respected; he knew she was not a highly accomplished English young lady, she did not move with rhythmic beauty, she did not sing like a syren or play like Chopin, but she was just Toney, with splendid health and beauty of her own, and with a character which influenced nearly everyone that came in contact with her.",f
28981,"Lewis knew that it was owing to her that his cottages were now in perfect repair, and that he now deserved better the name of a good landlord than he had done before.",f
28982,"It was Toney's influence, Toney's example of doing her best for her neighbours with all her heart, that had awakened his conscience, and yet the Waycotts were very proud of their good name.",f
28983,He could not bear that it should be said he had married the heiress for money--and he knew Lady Dove would say it.,f
28984,Would the world believe that he had loved the wild colt who had first visited him with the poor companion?,f
28985,"Toney had said herself people would want to marry her money, how should he be able to prove the contrary?",f
28986,Why had the old General ever taken a fancy to her?,f
28987,"He had not, however, to-day much time for thought, he could not even flatter himself that Toney connected him in the least with that kind of love, she was certainly heart-whole; would the awakening ever come, would blindfolded Cupid by chance let one of his arrows pierce her?",f
28988,Lewis could not answer this question.,f
28989,"If only he might woo her, he thought that perhaps he could awaken the sleeping boy, but there lay the difficulty; he could not, he dared not face the bare idea of Toney's thinking and of saying--for she seldom hid her thoughts--  ""Oh, it's only my money you care about!""",f
28990,"He must wait, and in the meantime what if someone bolder or less scrupulous won her!",f
28991,"As Lewis hurried to the hall to pick up some possessions before going home to lunch, he came face to face with Lady Dove.",f
28992,"""I've been helping to decorate,"" he said, to account for his presence.",f
28993,"""It is very kind of you, I'm sure, Mr. Waycott, though it was quite unnecessary to trouble you.",f
28994,Antonia is most thoughtless;,f
28995,I can't get a man or a boy to do anything to-day.,f
28996,"She has got them all.""",f
28997,"""They look uncommonly lively over it.""",f
28998,"""I daresay, anything is better than one's plain duty.",f
28999,"However, it will be over to-morrow.""",f
29000,Lady Dove heaved a sigh.,f
29001,"""It's very kind of you to keep open house,"" said Lewis, not knowing what to say.",f
29002,"""I don't wish to get credit when it's not deserved.",f
29003,Antonia will pay for it all.,f
29004,"The General left her a great deal of money, you know.""",f
29005,"""I suppose so,"" said Lewis, screwing his stick round on the gravel.",f
29006,"""Yes, indeed;",f
29007,"I don't quite know how much, because my poor husband has done nothing else these last four years but attend to all this wretched money.",f
29008,"I assure you I never could get any of his company, and somehow he was fortunate in some land speculations, which he never was with his own.""",f
29009,"""Sir Evas said he would quite miss the occupation.""",f
29010,"""Well, I for one shall be glad for him.",f
29011,He looks ten years older.,f
29012,"It's perfectly ridiculous to wear yourself out; and he never gets a penny by it, of course.",f
29013,He is quite morbidly particular about money.,f
29014,He always says he never would have married me if I had been an heiress.,f
29015,"He does so hate that modern habit of heiress hunting.""",f
29016,"""I don't think anyone would think Sir Evas was paid for his kindness.""",f
29017,"""There are so many evil tongues, Mr. Waycott; one hears such extraordinary things.",f
29018,"Already I've had two or three names mentioned to me as likely to pay court to Antonia--for her money, of course.""",f
29019,"""It will be certainly a bar to disinterested affection,"" answered Lewis.",f
29020,He would like to have used his stick on Lady Dove's head.,f
29021,She smiled graciously.,f
29022,"""I have seldom met such a thing, Mr. Waycott.",f
29023,I shall be very much interested when I do!,f
29024,"Poor Antonia must not expect to meet it, for certainly she has not charm or beauty to attract a man simply for herself.""",f
29025,"""Good morning, Lady Dove.",f
29026,I must hurry off.,f

29035,"These were his devoted Aunt Honoria and her widowed sister, Mrs. Hamilton, who was somewhat of a ""soft pussy cat,"" as Toney had once described her.",f
29036,"Her two daughters, Jeanie and Maud, were still unmarried, much to her disappointment.",f
29037,"Jeanie played first violin at amateur concerts, and Maud, with less talent, stepped into the breach when somebody had failed.",f
29038,"The sisters belonged to the large army of musical people whose performances are just not good enough to be valuable, though Jeanie had real talent.",f
29039,"Maud was pretty and gentle, but both sisters had imbibed their mother's pride of birth, all the greater because of their poverty.",f
29040,"Mrs. Hamilton was a Waycott of Waycott Hall, and her husband belonged to a very old Scotch family.",f
29041,"They might be poor, but they were of the bluest blood, and because of this Jeanie had ruined her happiness.",f
29042,"Four years ago a musician who was ""nobody in particular,"" except that his genius had raised him to eminence, had fallen in love with Jeanie and had made her an offer, but the Hamilton pride prevented her saying yes.",f
29043,She did not even dare tell her mother she loved him.,f
29044,How could Jeanie Hamilton marry a man whose parents had once kept a shop?,f
29045,It was impossible!,f
29046,"The ghost of that shop haunted her, even though Frank Weston had long since pensioned his parents.",f
29047,"Certainly the great people idolized Frank Weston, crowds filled any hall where he chose to play his violin, but how could Jeanie Hamilton accept his parents?",f
29048,"Mrs. Hamilton gently smiled as she said, ""Impossible.""",f
29049,"Frank Weston was not poor, for he earned a great deal of money, but he was born a plebeian.",f
29050,"Mrs. Hamilton had repeated and dictated Jeanie's refusal for her, and he had not even the satisfaction of seeing again the girl he worshipped.",f
29051,"He had, however, guessed the truth, and, deeply wounded, he made no further effort to win her, but he could not forget her.",f
29052,"On her part, Jeanie was always arguing the question with herself.",f
29053,"Of course her mother had been right, but as time went on the girl began to realise that she had thrown away her happiness.",f
29054,Her heart was breaking and her health was giving way.,f
29055,"Maud, too, was as soft wax in her mother's hands, and Mrs. Hamilton meant her to marry her cousin Lewis, and to be the mistress of Waycott Hall.",f
29056,"She had taken the girls to Dresden to finish their musical education, but now she had come back intending to marry Maud to Lewis and find a suitable match for Jeanie.",f
29057,"When Aunt Delia determined to do something she was seldom known to fail, but she never mentioned it to her sister Honoria, because she was so supremely happy as mistress of Waycott Hall that she did not wish her beloved nephew to marry anyone--at least, not yet, though of course the time for marriage must come some day, in order to carry on the succession of the old family of the Waycotts of Waycott Hall.",f
29058,"""How late you are, dear boy,"" exclaimed Miss Honoria, who, knowing every expression of her nephew's face, saw he was not in his best mood.",f

29083,"""How foolish of you, Honoria--if your things get stolen you can't blame anyone but yourself.",f
29084,"Are you willing, Lewis, if so, Maudie will go with you and help to carry the things?""",f
29085,"Lewis did not want Maud, but could not refuse.",f
29086,"""I shall tire Maud for I am walking.""",f
29087,"""Oh no, I shall want some fresh air before the dance.",f
29088,"How hot it will be in the barn!""",f
29089,"""You girls must fill up your programmes early,"" said Mrs. Hamilton pointedly.",f
29090,"""Oh, Toney won't have any!",f
29091,"She says people must dance as the spirit moves them.""",f
29092,"""How inconvenient.",f
29093,"Well, anyhow, Lewis, you'll see the girls get partners.""",f
29094,"""No fear!",f
29095,"Think of all the tenants dying to trip it with such fair damsels!""",f
29096,"""One has to _pretend_ one likes it,"" said Jeanie languidly;",f
29097,"""but it's not at all enjoyable.""",f
29098,"""I asked Toney to let me go off with Sally the kitchenmaid, but she wouldn't agree; she says I must foot it with Mrs. Goodman, the housekeeper.",f
29099,"She weighs two tons at least and all the men fight shy of her.""",f
29100,"Lewis' good temper had returned, and he was now ready to make fun of everything.",f
29101,"""But there is dancing in the dining-room, too, isn't there?"" said Jeanie.",f
29102,"""We shall dance everywhere 'till gunpowder comes out of the heels of our boots,'"" answered Lewis.",f
29103,"""Now do be sensible, Lewis.",f
29104,"There will be, I hear, many of the county folks,"" said Mrs. Hamilton, thinking that Jeanie might meet someone eligible.",f
29105,"""I believe so.",f
29106,"Lord and Lady Southbourne are coming, I know, and their eldest son, and George Lathom and heaps more.",f
29107,"Oh, the Carews, of course;",f
29108,"I heard Lady Carew saying the other day that nothing should prevent her coming to Toney's coming of age.""",f
29109,"""I really think it strange they all flock to a sort of party like this when they come as seldom as possible to the house at other times,"" said Miss Honoria.",f
29110,"""Honestly, Aunt Honoria, you wouldn't miss Toney's party yourself, would you, and you know you only go very seldom to call on Lady Dove.""",f
29111,"""I declare, Lewis, you are getting as direct as Toney herself,"" laughed Miss Honoria.",f
29112,"""I know Lady Dove is shuddering as to what is to happen to-night.",f
29113,"She says, 'you never know with Toney,' and that is a truer word than she often says!""",f
29114,"""I expect all this fuss and this money will turn Antonia Whitburn's head,"" said Mrs. Hamilton, who was jealous, but too ladylike to show it openly.",f
29115,"""Turn Toney's head, Aunt Delia!",f
29116,"You little know her, I really believe she no more thinks of money as bringing her any personal advantage than she would think that--putting a crown on her head would make her a queen.""",f
29117,"""You always were good-natured in defending poor Harum Scarum,"" answered his Aunt Delia;",f
29118,"""and I'm sure she needs a few friends to do it.",f
29119,"Mrs. Hales told me she saw no change in Toney's character in spite of all the places they sent her to in order to improve her.""",f
29120,"Lewis laughed heartily, and then rose to go.",f
29121,"""Well, Maud, come along, I'm off.",f
29122,I'll order the dog-cart to bring us back so as to have time to dress.,f
29123,"You will all come later.""",f
29124,"""Seeing poor people stuff doesn't interest me at all,"" said Jeanie; but Maud, who now always took her cue from Lewis, exclaimed,  ""I should like to go early if the carriage can go, twice.",f
29125,"I'll bring my violin and play something for them if Toney likes.""",f
29126,"""What a good idea,"" said Lewis brightly.",f
29127,"""The carriage can certainly take us early and go back for the lazy ladies.""",f
29128,"""Please don't kill yourself, my dear boy,"" said Miss Waycott with a smile.",f
29129,"She was torn between the pleasure of seeing Lewis happy and interested, and the fear of her sister Delia thinking her very foolish.",f
29130,It is never easy to hunt with the hounds and run with the hare.,f
29131,As the cousins were crossing the Park (having had special though private permission from Sir Evas to come that way whenever they liked) Lewis was smiling to himself.,f
29132,"""Poor Toney,"" he said presently, ""I believe she will regret even the terrible days of her first arrival at Aldersfield.",f
29133,"This beastly money will swallow up all her time, and Sir Evas has dug up an Australian secretary for her.",f
29134,"I hope he'll not be too much of a cad.""",f
29135,"""It will be like a novel, and he'll fall in love with her and marry her,"" said Maud.",f
29136,"""She would like an Australian, and he would understand her strange ways.""",f
29137,"""Perhaps; but I haven't heard that the Australians are less self-seeking than other people.",f
29138,"I think Toney is a _rara avis_.""",f
29139,"""It does seem a little hard on Lady Dove to have fallen on this rare bird!"" said Maud, laughing softly.",f
29140,She was so pretty and womanly that Lewis noticed her with pleasure.,f
29141,"He liked Maud much better than Jeanie, who always looked discontented, but the idea of marrying either of them had never entered his head.",f
29142,"""It was awfully nice of you, Maud, to think of playing to Toney's people.",f
29143,"I'm sure she will be delighted, but don't waste your pity on Lady Dove!""",f
29144,"""The new companion is a tyrant, I hear;",f
29145,I want to see her.,f
29146,Mother thinks it rather silly of Toney to make such a fuss over Mrs. Faber.,f
29147,It will make her very uppish.,f
29148,"That class of people, mother says, never can stand much notice.""",f
29149,Lewis laughed aloud.,f
29150,"""Pray, Maud, form your own opinions and don't quote those of other people.",f
29151,"Use your eyes to-day, and see what the Fabers are like.",f
29152,"Mrs. Faber has developed so wonderfully you would not know her for the same person, though she is still somewhat afraid of Lady Dove, which is not surprising.",f
29153,"That woman is simply odious.""",f
29154,"Very soon they reached Aldersfield, and Lewis conducted his cousin to the barn where he had worked so hard.",f
29155,"The preparations were drawing to a close, and at that moment Toney herself dashed out with a hammer in her hand.",f
29156,"""Why, Toney, you look like Sisera going to do the deed!",f
29157,"Is there anything I can get?""",f
29158,"""Oh, you'll do for audience beautifully, I was just going to fetch Mrs. Horner, but she is dreadfully busy.",f
29159,It's to hear Uncle Dove rehearse his speech.,f
29160,"We've put up the platform for him and all, and now he declares he can't make a speech--but he must.",f
29161,"Now do, Maud, you'll represent the ladylike portion.",f
29162,"Poor uncle is so shy, and only says 'Hum, hum!'""  They entered the barn, where Sir Evas was indeed looking supremely unhappy.",f
29163,"""Oh, Waycott, I'm glad you've come.",f
29164,"Toney declares I must make a speech and it's quite beyond me!""",f
29165,"""Oh yes you can, dear, ducky uncle.",f
29166,"Just say something that you really mean out of your heart.""",f
29167,"""That they won't make themselves ill with over-eating!""",f
29168,"""Oh, that's horrid, you wouldn't say that at your own table--but look, Mr. Waycott, what do you think of the whole?""",f
29169,"""Oh!"" exclaimed Maud, ""why it's too beautiful for them, and everything silver, and, oh, what lovely silver dishes!""",f
29170,Lewis gave Maud a little nudge; he knew this speech would be like gunpowder to Toney.,f
29171,"""Too beautiful!",f
29172,Of course not!,f
29173,How can anything be too beautiful?,f
29174,"Aren't these flowers exquisite, Mr. Waycott?",f
29175,"That was all your doing.""",f
29176,"""But it's like a grand dinner party,"" urged Maud.",f
29177,"""And so it is, a very grand dinner party.",f
29178,"Do you see the little roses, and the napkins folded like lilies?",f
29179,"The servants have just been awfully nice over it all, and the button-holes are ready for the men and a little posy for the ladies.",f
29180,"I'm just a wee bit afraid about the children, but Chum says I'm to trust her.""",f
29181,"""May I play something for them on the violin?"" asked Maud eagerly.",f
29182,"""Oh, how lovely, yes; but--not one of your long fugues, please.",f
29183,"Something they'd all like, just a brisk jig or imitation of bagpipes.""",f
29184,"Maud looked upon herself as a good player, but she nobly hid her disgust.",f
29185,"""I see, a good stirring dance.""",f
29186,"""Yes, just at first, something that will unloose their tongues, and that they can talk all through it till the dance begins.",f
29187,"Now, Uncle Evas, it's your turn.",f
29188,You must practise your speech.,f
29189,"Mr. Waycott, just sit there to represent the men, and Maud will do the stuck-ups, and I'll do the women.",f
29190,"It must suit us all, uncle.",f
29191,"You can just say how awfully glad you are to see them, and that Toney Whitburn is too, and that--no, I'll make my own, you'd go wrong.""",f
29192,"Happily for Sir Evas a footman entered at the moment, and announced that Lady Dove said would Sir Evas go at once, and see her on business.                                                                  ""What is the programme?"" asked Maud, catching Toney's enthusiasm.",f
29193,"""Uncle Evas, and any of us who like, will sit down to dinner here, then, when they are well started, we shall go to dine in the house, and hurry a little to begin the dancing here.",f
29194,"Poor people do like having plenty of time to eat, so I think we can manage it all.""",f
29195,"""When is Sir Evas to make his speech?""",f
29196,"""Just between their meat and pudding.",f
29197,"It will help them to digest, and they do like to hear speeches, so I'm going to make one, and anybody else who feels moved.",f
29198,"Won't you, Mr. Waycott?""",f
29199,"""But they are not my tenants, Toney.""",f
29200,"""But they are your neighbours, and we ought to love our neighbour as ourself.""",f
29201,"""I expect my people will be very jealous!"" answered Lewis laughing.",f
29202,"""Then you can have a party of your own.",f
29203,"I'll come and help you in return.""",f
29204,"""That's a promise, but I don't know what Aunt Honoria would say!""",f
29205,"""Oh!",f
29206,"My visitors are going to----  No, I won't tell you as you might let it out to Aunt Dove.",f
29207,"Uncle Evas gave leave, but----""  At this moment Sir Evas walked in, followed by Lady Carew.",f
29208,"""Oh! what a fairy palace!"" exclaimed her ladyship.",f
29209,"""Where is Miss Whitburn?",f

29211,"My husband is coming later, but I rebelled.""",f
29212,Lady Carew's face was all smiles.,f
29213,"She had never forgotten Toney's first tea-party at Aldersfield, besides the story of Toney's fortune and her coming of age was known to everyone for miles round.",f
29214,Toney gave one of her quick searching looks and settled that Lady Carew meant all she said.,f
29215,"""Well, that is nice of you!",f
29216,You haven't come because I've got such a heap of money!,f
29217,Oh dear!,f
29218,"Uncle Evas, I do believe I see somebody arriving in the distance.""",f
29219,Sir Evas looked too.,f
29220,"""Good heavens, Toney! it's the _avant garde_.",f
29221,"Much too early!""",f
29222,"""But you are glad they should enjoy themselves as long as possible, aren't you, and you said you wanted them to see your house, and you know----  Did you tell Mr. Diggings!""",f
29223,"""Tell him what, Toney?"" whispered Lewis, who was prepared for a surprise.",f
29224,"""That the house is open to _everybody_ to-day!",f
29225,"Fancy, Lady Carew, ever so many of uncle's tenants have never been in the house at all!",f
29226,"So now Uncle Evas has been awfully kind, and said Aldersfield should be thrown open, only----""  Sir Evas had hurried off.",f
29227,"""Only what?"" laughed Lewis, who had jumped to conclusions.",f
29228,"""He wouldn't tell Aunt Dove, so I want my friends to act as sentinels at her door! and we must all take parties round.",f
29229,"No one is to see this fairy palace till six!""",f
29230,"""Doesn't Lady Dove know?"" asked Lady Carew smiling, ""pray let me personally conduct as I have never seen all the house either.",f
29231,"I know there are fine pictures.""",f
29232,"""Well, no, Aunt Dove doesn't know.",f
29233,She would just have squirmed a bit at seeing so many of them all about.,f
29234,"I've just run round to open all the doors, but I posted a warning near Aunt Dove's door.",f
29235,"Oh, I do hope she is safe for a long time.",f
29236,"She said she was going to rest, and Miss Grossman is reading to her.""",f
29237,Maud and Lady Carew could not help laughing.,f
29238,"""Won't they do funny things?"" asked Maud ""You know, Lewis, your aunts wouldn't let your tenants roam about the house!""",f
29239,"""I'm afraid Toney will insist, but please let it be in the summer-time.""",f
29240,"""It would be nicer for them, but I couldn't help my birthday, could I?",f
29241,"Just look down the drive, it's getting black with people.",f
29242,I'll run round here first.,f
29243,"Mr. Waycott, will you see if the children's room is done, then we must all work and just talk and explain everything, and please, Lady Carew pretend you know them all as there isn't time to introduce.""",f
29244,"In another moment there was a scuffle and rush round, which Trick seemed to think, judging by his barking, was done specially to amuse him, and then at the open front door and on the top of the stone steps, Toney, Trick, and their special friends might be seen with very smiling faces, standing to receive the first batch of visitors, though looking down the drive the stream seemed continuous and thick.",f
29245,"It must be owned that the guests were very quiet and very shy, and the procession resembled a funeral much more than the beginning of a most novel party.",f
29246,"Never had half the visitors come so near the big house, but then never had they been invited.",f
29247,They all clutched their invitation cards as if they were talismen.,f
29248,"Toney had stationed the young footman at the bottom of the stairs to receive the cards, but there the first hitch occurred.",f
29249,A very sheepish labourer in his very best clothes shook his head as the footman held out his hand to receive the card.,f
29250,"""'Tis only to show you, young man,"" he said in a loud whisper.",f
29251,"""Will you kindly give it to me,"" was the answer.",f
29252,"""I have to collect them.""",f
29253,"""No, that you b'aint, I'm a-going to keep it;",f
29254,"I've promised my lad I'll frame it for 'im.""",f
29255,The second guest seeing the difficulty refused even to show his card.,f

29257,"If you can't a-read it just to get the name in your head, I can't help you no further.""",f
29258,"""Miss Whitburn said they were to be collected.""",f
29259,"These two rebels had stopped the stream, and Lewis, seeing something was happening, dashed down to the rescue.",f
29260,"""Afternoon, sir; the young man wants my card of invitation from Miss Toney herself.",f
29261,"I'd rather not come than give it to 'im.""",f
29262,Lewis was convulsed but soon set matters right.,f
29263,"""Pray keep them, but just show them as you come up.",f
29264,"Miss Whitburn is waiting up there for you.""",f
29265,"""'T'aint likely we'd give it up to _he_,"" said yet another visitor, casting looks of contempt on the footman who had tried to steal their precious cards.",f
29266,"The children, open-mouthed, clung to their parents, but the Thomas girls had been put first as they knew Miss Toney so well.",f
29267,"Up they came, men, women, and children, all sizes, dressed in varied costumes, and all staring hard at Toney, who, in her simple morning dress, was beaming with pleasure, and her eyes seemed to dance with glee.",f
29268,"""How do you do?",f
29269,How do you?,f
29270,"Oh, Mr. Grant, it is good of you to come with your lame foot.",f
29271,"Mrs. Chapman, the children are to go to their big room straight, lots of amusements for them, and they'll be well taken care of.",f
29272,Lady Carew and Miss Maud Hamilton have come to entertain you.,f
29273,"Oh please, Mrs. Curtis, do shake hands (Mrs. Curtis was curtseying).",f
29274,What a lovely nosegay!,f
29275,How kind of you.,f
29276,"Now, Miss Hamilton, will you take the first party round the house.",f
29277,"There are about thirty here,"" and Maud went off.",f
29278,"""How do you do?",f
29279,This is nice of you to come.,f
29280,"You're to go round the house anywhere except in Lady Dove's room, she's got a headache or something.""",f
29281,"""Shan't we hurt the carpets, miss, with our boots?"" said a patient looking woman, ""and here's some of our last roses, miss, for your birthday.",f
29282,"I'm sure we all wish you a very, very long life.""",f
29283,"""Thank you ever so much,"" and Toney was already holding an arm-full of very tight posies.",f
29284,"""Now, Mr. Waycott, will you take the second party.",f
29285,Show them my little room at the top of the house for they can see the tops of their cottages and chimneys from there.,f
29286,Sir Evas is coming soon.,f
29287,He had to see a bit to everything.,f
29288,"Dinner's very punctual at six, so please don't stop too long.""",f
29289,Lewis Waycott obeyed.,f
29290,"He had come there to obey to-day, and it was no good to think of shyness with Toney there.",f
29291,"She was really happy with these people, and could not have been condescending to them had she tried.",f
29292,"These poor cottagers, whose dull lives were seldom varied, were to have a real good day, and enjoy themselves, that was the idea that filled Toney's mind.",f
29293,Her one anxiety was the fear that Lady Dove would wake and come forth.,f
29294,At last the stream left off and only a few stragglers appeared.,f
29295,"Toney was keeping the last batch for herself, and the children were now safely housed in the barn house, listening spell-bound to a ventriloquist with Mrs. Faber in charge.",f
29296,"She was indeed happy, there was a great affinity between herself and children.",f
29297,"The tea-tables were spread, and the enjoyment of the little ones was doubled by secret glances at the good things which would soon find their way down their throats.",f
29298,"""Hulloa!"" called out the ventriloquist, putting his head up a chimney, ""are you there, Bill, why don't you come down?",f
29299,"I say, what's to day?""",f
29300,"""A coming of old age.""",f
29301,"""You silly, not old age, a coming of age.""",f
29302,"""Whose coming?""",f
29303,"""Well, it ain't my coming, for I ain't a-coming for anyone""--and so on till the children clapped and shouted, for suddenly Miss Toney herself appeared like a sudden burst of sunshine, and stayed ten minutes making fun.",f
29304,"""Oh, Chum, aren't they happy?""",f
29305,"""I should think they were,"" echoed Mrs. Faber.",f
29306,"Yes, the children were happy and tea followed very soon, and after tea a conjurer, and then the children were all fetched home by the neighbours from the other half of the village or by elder girls.",f
29307,After this Mrs. Faber slipped away to get ready for the dinner and the dance.,f
29308,In the meanwhile the multitude of fathers and mothers were tramping round the great house with wide open eyes and cautious feet.,f
29309,"To walk on Turkey carpets and look at the beautiful pictures and china the gentry looked at every day, was a new experience.",f
29310,"It must be said that Toney's party had a real treat, because she did showman in a very amusing style.",f
29311,"""It must be nice, miss, to live in such a wonderful house,"" said a poor woman whose home was not a thing of joy.",f
29312,"""It's a job to keep it clean though,"" said Toney, ""for my part I'd rather have a wee cottage if I had the work to do.",f
29313,"I used to keep our cottage nice, and I would rather be you for that, but I guess if we can't keep a cottage nice we should make a poor hand at keeping a big place like this spick and span.""",f
29314,"""Don't seem worth while, miss, to spend time on our poor places.""",f
29315,"""Oh, but it is.",f
29316,"Pups used to say that a cottage was the most healthy place in the world if the doors and windows were always open to let in God's sunshine, and if God's sunshine found no dust when it did get in there.",f
29317,"I'll tell you what, Mrs. Smith, we'll start a society for the brightest cottage in uncle's part of the village.",f
29318,"I'll give a beautiful prize for the best kept and you must win it.""",f
29319,"""Oh, miss!"" exclaimed Mrs. Smith of the sorrowful countenance, ""the children do dirty things so.""",f
29320,"""But they'll want you to win the prize.",f

29322,"I'm first-rate at cleaning kettles and can teach you.""",f
29323,Mrs. Smith began mentally scrubbing at once.,f
29324,Toney had another question to answer.,f
29325,"""If you please, miss,"" said a labourer, nodding towards a picture representing nymphs dancing, very scantily clothed, ""it must be a warm country where ladies have so little clothing on for dancing.",f
29326,"I suppose 'tis the fashion there.""",f
29327,Toney laughed.,f
29328,"""Oh, they are not real people, the artist just wanted to think of the spirit of the wood.",f
29329,"He means to represent all the happy thoughts one has in a lovely lonely wood.""",f
29330,The man shook his head slowly.,f
29331,He found it difficult to grasp the new idea of making your happy thoughts dance in light clothing.,f
29332,"""They be wonderfully tricky, the painters, miss.",f
29333,"There was a gentleman who come to paint in the village last summer, and who took our Ann's picture without shoes nor stockings.",f
29334,"I begged him not to show it to the neighbours as our Ann never do go bare-foot.""",f
29335,"""But it's very healthy, Mr. Carter.",f
29336,I used to run about without shoes and stockings when I was young.,f
29337,"I wish I could now, but you see----""  At this moment there was a cry heard from the end of the passage, where Toney and her party and Mr. Waycott and his party were just converging.",f
29338,"""Antonia!",f
29339,"Antonia!""",f
29340,"Toney was in front of a paper on which was written, ""Please walk on tip-toe down this passage.""",f
29341,Now the tip-toes of many persons are not noiseless and in the gathering twilight it had not been observed.,f

29358,"""Oh, Mr. Waycott, follow me on tip-toe, please, or a bomb will explode, but they have enjoyed themselves.""",f
29359,"Lewis literally obeyed, and Toney, smothering her laughter, hurried downstairs with him.                                                                 Toney made a dash to her bedroom where Rose was waiting to help her into her white dress.",f
29360,"It was very pretty and very simple, with soft lace round the base of the neck showing off the pose of the head and Toney's lovely hair.",f
29361,"""Miss Toney, you do look nice,"" exclaimed Rose, ""what will you wear round your neck?""",f
29362,"""My birthday present of course--Pup's picture.",f
29363,"You can't think how I value it.""",f
29364,"""Won't you wear this coral bracelet for luck, Miss Toney?""",f
29365,"""Yes, it is Mrs. Faber's present, it belonged to her great aunt, whose dress I once wore when I first came,"" and Toney laughed at the recollection.",f
29366,"""Now, I have not one minute more as uncle is going to walk me in.",f
29367,The people will like it so.,f
29368,They love a show-off.,f
29369,"Run, Rose, and get ready for waiting on them.",f
29370,"I wish I might do some of the waiting, but uncle wouldn't hear of it, and also it would look too much like a school feast.",f
29371,"Oh, give me some of those flowers the dear people brought to-day.",f
29372,"Wasn't it sweet of them, because they know I love flowers better than anything.""",f
29373,Toney and Rose each flew down different ways.,f
29374,"For one instant Toney was even tempted to slide down the balusters as in old days, but remembered her frock in time.",f
29375,"""I wish I could feel old--I suppose I shall when I'm seventy.",f
29376,"Oh dear, where is Uncle Evas, I expect----""  She knocked softly at his dressing-room door and stooping down spoke through the keyhole.",f
29377,"""Uncle Evas!",f
29378,"Hullo, are you there?""",f
29379,"She heard him cross the room on tip-toe, then he very softly opened the door.",f
29380,"""Yes, Toney, I'm ready.",f
29381,"Don't disturb your aunt, she is dressing.",f
29382,"I don't think she will be ready for your first dinner.""",f
29383,"""But you are, come along, and I say, uncle, you'll really eat, won't you, because they will think you're too proud if you don't.""",f
29384,"""I've never dined at six o'clock before, Toney.",f
29385,"It's a great trial to one's digestion, but I'll try.",f
29386,"Now, tell me the programme.""",f
29387,"""I've got them all in the hall and in the passages waiting to go to the barn.",f
29388,"Come on, uncle!",f
29389,"You mustn't keep your guests waiting.""",f
29390,Sir Evas wished himself anywhere but among so many guests.,f
29391,He knew that his wife might appear in no enviable mood; but Toney had him well in hand.,f
29392,Escape was impossible.,f
29393,"Putting on as good expression of welcome as he could, he followed her obediently.",f
29394,Their appearance at the top of the staircase had a magical effect.,f
29395,"All heads were turned towards the vision of their Miss Toney in an evening dress, its very simplicity making the angel idea more perfect to them, for the greater part had never seen a young lady in an evening dress except in illustrated magazines.",f
29396,"But this vision was by no means like a novelette heroine, calm, beautiful, and stately, whilst Toney never guessed she was worthy of admiration, her one thought being that it was just six o'clock.",f
29397,"""Here we are!",f
29398,"Sir Evas is so glad to welcome you all, and he's so glad you've seen all his house.",f
29399,If you don't mind we'll lead the way to dinner.,f
29400,"People generally go two and two, but please don't bother about that, it always seems to me like the animals in the ark.""",f
29401,"And Toney's merry laugh made everybody feel at home as, taking her uncle's arm she crossed the hall.",f
29402,"At this moment, Lewis, Lady Carew, Maud and the Fabers, and the Hales came out of the small drawing-room.",f
29403,"They were not going to miss this part of the entertainment, having nobly done their duty as showmen.",f
29404,"""Oh, how nice--Mr. Hales, you know everybody, will you just go about the middle and Mr. Waycott bring up the rear, and Mr. Tarrant, will you give your arm to Lady Carew and set a good example.""",f
29405,"Lady Carew meant to do the whole thing properly, for she knew she would be only one of a crowd at Toney's coming of age party; in spite of this she felt glad her lord and master was not there to see her introduced to the bailiff, who blushed purple and offered her his arm, and held hers very tightly as if he had been specially cautioned to see that she did not run away.",f
29406,"Maud, Silvia, and Mrs. Faber took the first-comers, but as the male parts of the procession were quite uncertain as to which arm to give to the ladies, but yet were determined minutely to follow their leader, there were several _chasse croise_ during the short distance to the barn, accompanied by the nervous apology of ""Excuse me, miss, but I think we're wrong.",f
29407,"Miss Toney said we were to follow her, and I be on her side instead of t'other.""",f
29408,"The other ladies and gentlemen, though they had leave to come anyhow, would not be singular, and whispered jokes might have been heard such as, ""Now, doey take he,"" ""We ain't quite of the right age, Mr. Jones,"" ""'Tis wonderful how the gentry remembers all these puzzling habits, ain't it?",f
29409,Miss Toney looks like as if she'd just come down from heaven.,f
29410,"She be a rare 'un, 'tain't likely there's another like her in England, now is it?",f
29411,"We don't know nothing about furrin countries, but I'll take my oath there's none in England like her.""",f
29412,"""Nor Scotland, Ireland, nor Wales,"" said a young man who was a ""mighty scholard.""",f
29413,"""Well to be sure I was forgetting t'others of the family, but the Scotch are very close-fisted, and the Orish is too cranky, and the Welsh speaks gibberish, 'tain't likely there's any like her in their countries.""",f
29414,But already the middle and tail of the procession silenced by a sudden exclamation from the foremost guests.,f
29415,The doors were flung open and all at once the dazzling lights revealed a scene none had even dreamt of for beauty and gloriousness.,f
29416,Lady Carew was the first to exclaim.,f
29417,"""How lovely!",f
29418,Look at the flowers.,f
29419,"How wonderful!""",f
29420,"Mr. Farrant opened his mouth, but what came from it was, ""Bless my soul and body!""",f
29421,"And then behind and behind came various ""Lors!",f
29422,Me stars!,f
29423,Bless me's!,f
29424,"Did you evers!""",f
29425,"Of course the helpers were more prepared, but even they had not seen it fully lighted up.",f
29426,"On and on they came, the guests, the buzz growing into a blast, the blast into a hurricane of words, but by this time Toney had dragged her uncle on to the platform and was standing by him, seeing from her vantage ground that everybody was seated.",f
29427,This was by no means as easy as it appeared.,f
29428,"The partners got mixed at the entrance, and thought it a point of honour to find each other again, and, what with their anxiety and the astonishment they did not know how to express adequately, Toney's guests were in danger of not sitting down at all.",f
29429,"Mr. Hales came to the rescue, mounted the platform and called out, ""Ladies and gentlemen, will you stand whilst I say grace, and then sit down where you find yourselves.""",f
29430,"""Praise God from Whom all blessings flow,"" began the clerk, not waiting for Mr. Hales, and a great sound of thanksgiving rose among the rafters.",f
29431,These guests at least were thankful even for the sight of their dinner!,f
29432,"""Thank you, Mr. Hales, I believe we should never have sat down but for you!",f
29433,"Now, uncle, come and take your place at the head of the table with me, and mind you eat a bit of everything, you know!""",f
29434,"""But indeed I don't know, Toney.",f
29435,What's the menu?,f
29436,Ah!,f
29437,"I see, good Lord!",f
29438,"Ox-tail soup, pheasant, beef.",f
29439,"What else?""",f
29440,"But now another hitch occurred, no one would begin till Toney, in despair, seized a spoon and began herself in earnest.",f
29441,"The guests looked at her and looked at each other, then with an evident effort and sigh of content began the work of eating.",f
29442,"The rest came naturally, at least there was no longer any effort, and ""the rich viands,"" as the reporter chronicled afterwards, quickly disappeared.",f
29443,"Toney had not reckoned with time, however, and it was seven before the meats were done, and then came the pause to bring on the sweets.",f
29444,"""Uncle, now's the time, you know; have you got it all right?""",f
29445,"""No, I haven't, and for goodness sake, let's have no speeches, there isn't time, the other guests will be coming soon, and--your aunt----""  ""There's heaps of time, uncle, screw your courage up, you know, and they will be so pleased.",f
29446,"Remember to begin about being awfully delighted.""",f
29447,"The many waiters stood to attention, having been duly warned, and a sudden hush fell on the company.",f
29448,"Poor Sir Evas felt as if he were being led to execution as he found himself on the platform, this time without Toney.",f
29449,"His speech had clean gone out of his head except Toney's two words, ""awfully delighted,"" and that did not sound quite dignified.",f
29450,"""Hum, hum, I'm awfully delighted--hum--to see you here to-night, but I hope, my friends, you all understand that this is my niece's doing on her coming of age.",f
29451,"We men are rather up a tree when our female relations determine to do something, and as people rarely come of age, hum (that is idiotic), I mean only once in their lives, Miss Whitburn has had her way.",f
29452,"I hope you'll all think it a very good way.""",f
29453,(Cheers and thumps.),f
29454,"""Never was one for speaking wasn't Sir Evas.",f
29455,"There's folks 'as got oily tongues and some as 'asn't.""",f
29456,This from a sympathetic old lady.,f
29457,"""Time's getting on (that's idiotic too), so I must say no more than I hope you will always remember this dinner, and I wish you all to drink the health of my niece, Toney Whitburn.""",f
29458,"A great cheering and drinking of health, with a perfect clatter of glasses, followed.",f
29459,"Toney was deeply disappointed, she had prepared such a lovely speech for her uncle, and he had declared he would say it, or ""words to that effect,"" but he hadn't!",f
29460,"She didn't want him to have mentioned her, but all about the guests themselves.",f
29461,"In another moment Toney had sprung on the platform, and then there was such a noise as never was, and simultaneously they all rose and sang, ""For she's a jolly good fellow,"" the only known equivalent in the English language for great approval.",f
29462,"The words were nothing, as we know, but it was the great feeling of love which upset Toney.",f
29463,"All her own lovely speech fled out of her head, and the view became misty.",f
29464,"She felt as if she was far away on the Australian land and that her father was close beside her saying, ""Courage, Toney, you know I hate tears.""",f
29465,Then with the back of her hand she brushed away something that was nearly falling and took courage.,f
29466,"""Thank you very much, kind friends, for giving me such a jolly chorus on my birthday.",f
29467,"I have given you a dinner such as I wish you had every day, at least, no, not quite, but I want you to remember to-day because if I were to forget it there would be ever so many of you to remind me of my duty.",f
29468,"Without Sir Evas you wouldn't have had this entertainment, because it was he who insisted on his penniless niece coming over here, and when the dear old General left me his money to spend on other people, because he died and couldn't do it himself, well, then Sir Evas took all the trouble of it--and money is an awful trouble--and he's been helping me for weeks to arrange everything, and he really is a ""jolly good fellow""----  Great stamping of feet and great shouting, as if Toney had made a tremendous good joke, and then a wild beginning again of ""For he's a jolly good fellow,"" till Mr. Hales begged for silence, and Toney, convulsed with laughter, beckoned to Lewis Waycott and Mr. Hales to come up to her, which they both did.",f
29469,"""Toney, go on,"" said Lewis, ""they want some more.""",f
29470,"""I daren't.",f
29471,Uncle is fidgeting.,f
29472,Time's nearly up.,f
29473,Aren't grandees a bother?,f
29474,"Mr. Hales, it's your turn now.""",f
29475,"""Just wish them a happy evening,"" said Mr. Hales smiling.",f
29476,"Then Toney went a step forward, and the hubbub ceased like magic.",f
29477,"""I haven't anything more to say except to wish you a jolly evening and plenty of dancing after the dinner is cleared away, and oh, one thing, I want you to give a chorus for Dr. Latham, who is, as you know, the best doctor in the county.",f
29478,"I know it because my father was a doctor, and the very best in the world.",f
29479,"He never thought of himself, and I like people to know about Pups, who was a hero, and if you please I should like you to give a chorus for Trick, who came with me, and has been my dear friend ever since, and for his sake I hope you will be kind to all animals, as they do care and understand nearly everything--at least Trick does.",f
29480,"That's all, and time is up.""",f
29481,"Such a chorus followed, but this time Sir Evas was firm, and left the platform to Mr. Hales and Lewis Waycott, and led Toney forcibly down the centre of the room, though she had to seize and shake many hands on the way, promising right and left to come back and dance when the other dinner was over.",f
29482,"Once outside the barn, it must be told that Sir Evas and Toney raced to the house and ran up the steps just as a carriage and pair of bays pulled up.",f
29483,"Happily, they slipped in without being seen, only when Sir Evas joined his wife in the drawing-room, he and Toney panted audibly.",f
29484,"""Evas, you are really too bad to be so late;",f
29485,"Lord Southbourne's carriage is at the door.""",f
29486,"""Yes, I know, Melina; but we are in time, so where's the harm?""",f
29487,"""I should have had to receive them alone if you hadn't come----""  ""Lord and Lady Southbourne and the Honourable Edward Lang,"" announced the footman, and Lady Dove became affable.",f
29488,"""How do you do?",f
29489,How very kind of you to come.,f
29490,Here is the young lady who has come of age to-day.,f
29491,The neighbourhood has responded so kindly.,f
29492,"Do come to this sofa, Lady Southbourne.""",f
29493,Lord Southbourne had never seen Toney before.,f
29494,"The family had only lately come to the neighbourhood, but this is what he heard her saying,  ""I wish you hadn't come quite so early; we were having such a nice time with the tenants, but you will come and dance presently, won't you?""",f
29495,"""We have all come to do your bidding,"" said Lord Southbourne, kindly giving Toney a bow; but his son laughed.",f
29496,"""We heard marvellous tales of your entertainment, Miss Whitburn,"" said he.",f
29497,"""My father thinks you'll make our tenants' dinners blush in future.""",f
29498,"""Anyhow, the people are happy,"" said Toney; fanning herself vigorously.",f
29499,"""They've given us four 'jolly good fellows' already, and it's hot work, I can tell you.""                                                                     The dinner party which Lady Dove had arranged was very select, with a few exceptions.",f
29500,"She meant to reap some social benefits from Toney's coming of age in order to make up for the ""most unnecessary fuss over the poor people.""",f
29501,This evening she was quite gracious and pleasant to everyone at her own dinner table.,f
29502,"It must be owned, too, that Toney was for the moment rather tired and sleepy, and glad to sit still and almost silent between Mr. Hales and Lewis Waycott, so that the aristocratic party were quite surprised to see only a bright-haired young lady in snowy white, behaving very decorously.",f
29503,"Strange stories had, of course, gathered round Toney's personality, one of which was that she was a terrible Socialist, a character which, in this part of the country, almost put the owner of it out of the pale of society.",f
29504,"But to be kind to the poor was simply a duty, and an entertainment to the tenants was a time-honoured institution which no one could reasonably object to.",f
29505,"Of course these aristocratic people had not beheld Toney's dinner table, for they would have been truly shocked to see rare flowers and shining silver set before the lower orders; moreover, they would have felt that pheasants were eternally disgraced by having appeared on that occasion.",f
29506,So all went well.,f
29507,"Lady Carew took care to tell no tales to Lord Southbourne or to her own immaculate husband, who was talking county politics with Lady Southbourne whilst the dinner took its accustomed course, now and then urged on by a side remark of Toney's to Mr. Diggings not to be too long, as the ball was to begin directly dinner was over.",f
29508,"""I am sure, Toney, you will be tired out,"" said Mr. Hales, ""but even if there were no more to come you have given them something to remember.""",f
29509,"""A real good time for them, isn't it?",f
29510,But they are much too grateful!,f
29511,"It's so easy to give away money.""",f
29512,"""But not trouble and thought.""",f
29513,"""I'm trying to behave well, but I really can't eat much, and I feel rather sleepy!",f
29514,"Oh, Mr. Waycott, just look across and see how beautiful Mr. Faber looks.",f
29515,"You can't think what a good clergyman he is; those two live just like the early Christians.""",f
29516,"""How did they live?",f
29517,"The present time is against the simple life.""",f
29518,"""But, you see they can do it, they are not hedged in with parks and money and Society.",f
29519,"It's like the life at Little Gidding, when you stay with them, except they have no organ playing during their meals.""",f
29520,"""What is the special mark of the early Christian?"" asked Lewis with a smile.",f
29521,"""They don't seem ever to complain of being poor, and always share everything they have, it seems to me; and especially, they are so happy.",f
29522,"Mr. Faber has a text over his fire-place, 'Rejoice always,' and they really do it.",f
29523,"Now, Aunt Dove is never happy.",f
29524,You should have seen me and Uncle Evas racing here from the barn.,f
29525,"He really raced, it wasn't make believe--and I was laughing so much when we came into the drawing-room to receive a scolding.""",f
29526,"""Have you undertaken Miss Grossman, Toney?"" asked Mr. Hales.",f
29527,"""Oh! no! but I do admire her; she isn't one bit afraid of Aunt Dove, and almost enjoys having words with her.""",f
29528,"""Will you give me the first dance, Toney?"" said Lewis.",f
29529,"""No, not the first; there are ever so many of the men who will be too shy to begin if I don't go and ask them, and they won't dare to say no! but I will have a dance with you after everyone is set going.",f
29530,"Aunt Dove is coming to look on a few minutes, she says.",f
29531,"Oh dear, somebody's drinking my health;",f
29532,I wish they wouldn't.,f
29533,"I can't be any healthier than I am, can I?""",f
29534,"Lord Southbourne had risen to propose the health of the heiress, and Sir Evas seconded it with a few words of thanks.",f
29535,"""Shall I say thanks for you, Toney?"" asked Lewis.",f
29536,"""Oh, no, thank you; they'll think I'm dumb,"" and then the girlish figure in white stood up straight and lithe.",f
29537,"""Thank you, everybody, very much; but I know no one would have made any fuss about me if it hadn't been for the General's money, so it's the money that ought to be returned thanks for, and I do.",f
29538,"I know it will be very hard to give it away properly, but I mean to try; and may I ask a favour? will you all come at once to the ball in the barn, and not stop to drink wine, because the people are longing to dance, and they won't begin without us.""",f
29539,"""My dear Antonia!"" exclaimed Lady Dove, smiling deprecatingly as the company laughed, ""what will our guests think?",f
29540,"Of course, we will excuse you, and anyone who likes to follow you----  On her birthday she must be forgiven.""",f
29541,"There was a general move, and most of the company followed Toney's white figure as she sped onward.",f
29542,"Poor Sir Evas had risen, but dared not follow without his wife.",f
29543,Happily Lord and Lady Southbourne solved the difficulty.,f
29544,"""If Lady Dove does not mind, we should enjoy seeing the beginning of the ball,"" and of course, Lady Dove was ""only too delighted,"" and now everybody followed Toney's lead.",f
29545,There was no room for disappointment when the door was thrown open.,f
29546,"The whole place had been cleared, the boards polished, one platform erected for the band and another for visitors.",f
29547,The wealth of flowers and wreaths made the place look more like an enchanted palace than a barn on the Dove estate.,f
29548,"But it was not money alone that had done this, it was the loving heart of a girl of twenty-one which had planned it all.",f
29549,The band struck up and the Hon.,f
29550,Edward Lang approached Toney.,f
29551,"""May I have the pleasure?""",f
29552,"""Of course you may; there's the bailiff's wife, she thinks no end of herself, and if you dance with her we shall hear of it for the rest of her life.",f
29553,"Mrs. Farrant, Mr. Lang wants to dance with you, and oh, Mr. Waycott, do find someone proper for Lord Carew--unless he's too stiff.",f
29554,"Isn't it nice of Lady Carew, she's got hold of Peter Smith herself.",f
29555,"Real jolly of her!""",f
29556,"""And you, Toney, they are waiting for you?""",f
29557,"""Oh, anybody will do for me.",f
29558,"There's Long Tom, he'll never get round if I don't drag him by main force.",f
29559,Do see that Uncle Evas doesn't forget his partner.,f
29560,"Oh, isn't this scrumptious!""",f
29561,"The band began, a really good band from the garrison, and as if by magic there was--we ought to have said a poetry of motion, but to the onlooker the motion was there, though if the poetry was somewhat wanting, however, the seal of happiness was on all faces.",f
29562,"Lady Dove on her platform kept a few guests by her side, but very soon even these were drawn into the whirlpool, and left her alone in company with Miss Grossman, who had elected to come and look on for a short time, though as she sternly said she never danced.",f
29563,"""It's most extraordinary, Miss Grossman, that our guests care to dance with this mixed company.""",f
29564,"""One never knows what people will do,"" said Miss Grossman in a tone of great decision, ""I am never carried away.""",f
29565,"It would indeed have been a strong, bold man who would have carried Miss Grossman away--against her wish.",f
29566,"""You show your common sense, because it would want strength to get a bumpkin through this quadrille.",f
29567,"When I was young I was a famous dancer, everyone praised my figure and my deportment.",f
29568,Of course _young ladies_ were carefully shielded in my youth from anything like familiar intercourse with the lower orders.,f
29569,"Good gracious, Antonia is dancing with the cowman!",f
29570,I see her pinning up her dress.,f
29571,"It serves her right; but, of course, the poor girl was brought up most strangely in Australia, so all this seems natural to _her_.""",f
29572,"""Of course,"" said Miss Grossman, ""that accounts for a good deal.",f
29573,"Though my family was in straightened circumstances, _I_ was brought up as a gentlewoman.""",f
29574,This was more than Lady Dove could stand from a companion.,f
29575,"""It's strange how many people call themselves gentlefolks nowadays.",f
29576,In my youth you were in society or you were not.,f
29577,The Radicals have turned people's heads.,f

29579,"""I don't think so; there are very marked lines of demarcation even now.",f
29580,"Of course, Lady Dove, you have _generally_ had people of the class of Mrs. Faber with you, and cannot judge what is due to----""  ""How ridiculous, Miss Grossman!",f
29581,We are talking at cross purposes.,f
29582,I meant County people.,f
29583,"There is dear Lady Carew looking quite tired out, pray go and ask her to come up here.""",f
29584,"Miss Grossman reluctantly obeyed, and presently returned followed by Lady Carew and Toney herself, for both were coming to get pinned up.",f
29585,"""How distressing!",f
29586,"Your lovely dress, Lady Carew!",f
29587,"I always said no one should come in nice clothes to dance with----""  ""Aunt Dove, you don't know how they admired our dresses!",f
29588,I've heard lovely remarks.,f
29589,"Lady Carew, they thought you were just like the dove in the ark!""",f
29590,"""How delicious!",f
29591,"I don't mind my dress a bit, thank you; you seem to have provided plenty of pins, Miss Whitburn, you have thought of everything!""",f
29592,"""Everyone has danced at least once, I've seen to it, though one man declared 'twas wonderful folks did like whirly-gigging round so much!'""  ""He showed his sense,"" said Miss Grossman.",f

29607,"Near the entrance, however, she met Toney and Lady Southbourne together.",f
29608,"""You are not going yet, are you, Miss Crossman?",f
29609,This is ice time.,f
29610,"We must all set an example in that line, because some of our friends are looking rather doubtfully at them.""",f
29611,"""Excuse me, Miss Whitburn, I prefer my bed to ruining my digestion.",f
29612,Nothing is more indigestible than an ice at night.,f
29613,Good night.,f
29614,"Lady Dove begs you will go and rest, Lady Southbourne,"" and Miss Grossman disappeared from this world of folly.",f
29615,Toney had seized on Lewis Waycott.,f
29616,"""Can you swallow unlimited ices? they really are the very best;",f

29618,"""Then let's have one now.",f
29619,"I do love dancing, that's the only accomplishment that ever made friends with me.",f
29620,"It's poetry, isn't it?""",f
29621,Lewis thought so as Toney and he waltzed round the big barn.,f
29622,"""I hope you have had a happy birthday,"" said Lewis in a pause.",f
29623,"""Just about perfect.",f
29624,"Could I have been happier, as you and the Fabers, and Dr. Latham, and uncle, and Trick are all here, and you have all been so good and kind, and then Pups' picture!",f
29625,All through the evening I have been putting my hand up to stroke it.,f
29626,"It was an inspiration on your part and I shall never be grateful enough.""",f
29627,"""I--I don't want gratitude--I--want----""  ""Oh, what?",f
29628,"Do let me give it to you,"" said Toney eagerly.",f
29629,"""It's nothing money can buy,"" said Lewis, smiling at the eager face.",f
29630,"""Some day, perhaps----""  ""Some day, and why not now, to-night, but I'm glad it's nothing to do with money.",f
29631,"I heard Aunt Dove say to Mrs. Hamilton, 'Of course it's a great misfortune for the poor girl, she has not an idea how to spend money.'""  ""What did you think about it?""",f
29632,"""Oh, to myself I just said, 'you bet!' but of course I know that's vulgar!",f

29645,"""Of course I shall!",f

Toney's coming of age had been the greatest success imaginable, both rich and poor had declared, with perfect truth, that they had never enjoyed themselves more; but some few of them also realised that the result had been attained by weeks of thought and hard work on the part of Toney and Sir Evas.",f
29653,"All they had gone through to attain their object was their own secret, and jealously guarded; but it drew them, if possible, closer together, and the master of Aldersfield had his reward.",f
29654,"It was very early in the morning before the girl bade a last good-bye to her rich friends, for the poor ones had gradually melted away about eleven o'clock, the next day's toil having to be thought of.",f
29655,"Lady Dove had long before, happily, excused herself, pleading great weariness after such a hard day's work, and the atmosphere cleared in consequence.",f
29656,"Toney seized her uncle and made him dance till he called for mercy, and even Mrs. Faber was not let off, partners being provided for her.",f
29657,"Mr. Faber never danced, but waited on everybody or discussed clerical questions with Mr. Hales.",f
29658,"Now at last all were gone, and Toney was alone in her simple room.",f
29659,Even Trick was fast asleep as she knelt to say her prayers and returned thanks to the Giver of all her pleasure.,f
29660,"The excitement had taken away her sleepiness, so before putting out her light she opened the little book Mr. Hales had given her, and at the beginning read the story of how Brother Bernard, of Quintavelle, was converted by St.",f
29661,"Francis, whilst this latter was still a secular.",f
29662,"Bernard wished to find out whether the young and once worldly Francis was really a saint, so he asked him to sup and lodge with him, and prepared a bed in his own room for the young man.",f
29663,Both pretended to sleep.,f
29664,"Bernard snoring loudly, and St.",f
29665,"Francis hearing this, rose from his bed and began praying very earnestly till morning, saying only, ""My God, my God.""",f
29666,"But Bernard was watching him all the time, and was so much touched that he determined to change his life.",f
29667,In the morning he said to St.,f
29668,"Francis that he would leave the world and follow him, but St.",f
29669,Francis said they must first ask counsel how to find the Path of Perfection.,f
29670,"So they went to the Bishop's house, and begged him to open the Bible three times and see what text he found.",f
29671,"The first was, ""If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor, and follow Me;",f
29672,"""and the second was, ""Take nothing for your journey, neither staves nor scrip, neither bread, neither money;",f
29673,"""and the last was, ""If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.""",f
29674,"Bernard, being very rich, went out and sold all that he had, and with great joy he gave all his possessions to the poor.",f
29675,"At this point Toney's eyes began to blink, so she closed the book and put it under her pillow with a smile on her lips, murmuring, ""'The Path of Perfection.'",f
29676,Isn't that beautiful?,f
29677,Why can't we be like that now?,f
29678,"I know Pups would have liked this little book, and the 'Path of Perfection,' ever so much.""",f
29679,Then Toney fell asleep and dreamt that St.,f
29680,"Francis came to ask her for _all_ her money, and that she refused it to him, saying, ""You really won't know what to buy for English people, because you have only had to do with the nice, dirty Italian organ-grinders, who can live on almost nothing.""",f
29681,"It was quite late when the house party reassembled, and Toney was the only one who showed no signs of fatigue.",f
29682,She found a big pile of letters on the table.,f
29683,"From henceforth her simple, easy life would be a thing of the past; but at present, with the unbounded confidence of youth, she faced the problem bravely.",f
29684,"""Is there anything further I can advise you about, Miss Whitburn?"" said Mr. Staines, ""for I shall be going back to London very shortly.""",f
29685,"""Yes, please, I want some last words with you, I think we had better have a telephone between us.",f
29686,It will save a lot of letters.,f
29687,"Aunt Dove, you have forgiven us, haven't you?"" asked Toney.",f
29688,"""But you are rewarded by the gratitude of the people.",f
29689,"They just thought your house a lovely museum.""",f
29690,"""It's a great pity to put ideas into poor people's heads,"" answered Lady Dove.",f
29691,"""I hope this party will last their life-time.""",f
29692,"""Miss Grossman was done up I suppose; it's very tiresome of her, she sent word she must stay in bed to-day.",f
29693,"If it's influenza of course I don't want her near me.""",f
29694,"""I do not think the poor envy luxury,"" said Mr. Faber thoughtfully, ""they sometimes envy the certainty of our meals.""",f
29695,"""Education creates needs,"" said Mr. Staines, ""but I once knew a man who was perfectly happy if he had five shillings in his pocket, though he had no idea where the next would come from.""",f
29696,"""Pups was like that,"" exclaimed Toney, ""so it shows money isn't happiness.",f
29697,"Aunt Dove, don't you think 'Brother Angel' would be a good name for Mr. Faber?",f
29698,He was one of the followers of St.,f
29699,Francis.,f
29700,He thought nothing at all about money.,f
29701,"I read a lovely story in my new book about him when I was brushing my hair.""",f
29702,"""How ridiculous you are, Antonia--I suppose you must go this morning, Mr. Faber, as I often tell Mr. Hales, a clergyman is nothing if he is not among his people.""",f
29703,Mr. Faber was still smiling over Toney's last speech and did not even notice the _sous entendu_ of her ladyship's remark.,f
29704,"""I am afraid I must return, but I am sure Anne would stay and take Miss Grossman's place for a day or two, if it is the least convenience to you, Lady Dove.""",f
29705,"This was just what Lady Dove did want, but she did not wish to show gratitude.",f
29706,"""Oh, I daresay you could not get your meals without her.""",f
29707,Mrs. Faber did not allow her deep disappointment to be seen.,f
29708,"Henry was always sacrificing himself, she must follow his example.",f
29709,Only Toney noted the sad look in her eyes.,f
29710,"""Indeed our old Martha is far more necessary to my husband than I am.",f
29711,"She cooks beautifully.""",f
29712,"""She must be rather wasted at your Vicarage.",f
29713,"However, of course, Anne Faber, if you like an extra holiday pray stay.",f
29714,"Toney will be of no use this week, and if Miss Grossman does not get better she must go home.""",f
29715,"""Certainly I will stay,"" and she smiled across to Toney, who nodded her satisfaction.",f
29716,"""You all covered yourselves with glory I can tell you.",f
29717,"Bully! wasn't it?""",f
29718,"""Antonia!"" exclaimed Aunt Dove.",f
29719,"""Well, so it was, but when you want to forsake the world and become one of St.",f
29720,"Francis' brethren, uncle, I'm sure he'll take you.",f
29721,"He told one of the rich young men who offered themselves, to 'serve the brethren,' and I know you did that yesterday, so you were in the path of perfection.",f
29722,"Isn't that an awfully nice name?""",f
29723,"""I don't think that sort of life would suit me,"" said Sir Evas smiling.",f
29724,"""Well, I shall go and meet your secretary this morning, Toney, whilst you talk to Mr. Staines.""",f
29725,"Toney led the way to her new sitting-room which did not feel half so homely to her as the little sitting-room at the top of the house, but she would not let her uncle see this.",f
29726,"Mr. Staines sat down, and Toney dropped into a chair and put her elbows on the writing table, after she had thrown down a heap of letters.",f
29727,"""Ouf!",f
29728,"Look at those, Mr. Staines; to think they will come every morning.""",f
29729,"""The new secretary will sift these for you, Miss Whitburn.""",f
29730,"""Poor fellow!",f
29731,"Well, what I want to say is this.",f
29732,Have you made it quite right about Aunt Dove's money?,f
29733,"Will two thousand a year make a difference to her?""",f
29734,"""Yes, a very handsome gift.""",f
29735,"""I can't cost her that in food, can I? though I have a good appetite.""",f
29736,"""She does not really need it.""",f
29737,"""But I want you to arrange about the capital and give it to her entirely.""",f
29738,"""Is that wise?",f
29739,"Lady Dove might die and----""  Toney had on her resolute air.",f
29740,"""I am quite sure I want that: Uncle Evas would have it if she died, and it will be off my mind.",f
29741,"My General would like it, I think.",f
29742,"Ouf! that will be some of it disposed of, won't it?""",f
29743,Mr. Staines smiled.,f
29744,This was not the usual tone of his rich clients.,f
29745,"""That's all now, Mr. Staines, and I want your firm well paid for all your trouble, so that I shan't mind bothering you.""",f
29746,"""About your will, Miss Whitburn, you must send me instructions as soon as possible, you see you have the whole control, and it is not right to leave anything uncertain.""",f
29747,"""Of course----  You mean I might have a fit or break my head.",f
29748,"My will is soon arranged, I'll leave the whole to Uncle Evas, and tell him what to do with it in case that happens, but it's only in case, for I have other ideas.""",f
29749,"""Of course, and you must want time to think it over.",f
29750,"I'll draw up this simple will and get it signed before I go.""",f
29751,"""Uncle Evas says you are an awfully honourable lawyer.",f
29752,I'm so glad because Pups always said it was best to avoid the man of law.,f
29753,"However, Pups' money was so wingy that he never needed a man to tie it up.""",f
29754,"""He little guessed his daughter would be so amply provided for,"" said Mr. Staines beaming with real delight, which the handling of money always gave him, even though it was that of his clients and not his own.",f
29755,"""No, indeed.",f
29756,"He was always make believing about King Arthur, and now I mean to study 'The Little Flowers of St.",f

29758,St.,f
29759,"Francis was awfully simple about money, you know.",f
29760,"Now we have done, haven't we?",f
29761,Here is my will.,f

29763,Antonia Whitburn.',f
29764,That won't waste the time of your clerks.,f
29765,You quite frightened me when you sent me the General's will The clerks must have racked their brains to find odd and useless words.,f
29766,Thank you a thousand times.,f
29767,"I'll call the Fabers to sign it, but it's only in case of accidents.",f
29768,"I've got lots more notions, and Uncle Evas doesn't want money.",f
29769,"He's really quite nice about it, only he has to give in accounts.""",f
29770,"""To give in accounts?""",f
29771,"""Yes, to Aunt Dove.",f
29772,"She holds the purse-strings, uncle says, and there's a little breeze if he exceeds.""",f
29773,"Mr. Staines thought he had better draw a veil over this part of the conversation, and very soon Toney's temporary will was signed and deposited in Mr. Staines' pocket, who thought as he journeyed back, ""I never met such an extraordinary girl in all my life.""",f
29774,But it does not harm even a lawyer to think for a few minutes that money is not the aim of all mankind!,f
29775,"It was wonderful how soon Mrs. Faber reverted to the habits of her long bondage--though now she knew it was only an interlude--for Toney found her writing notes and doing flowers and being bullied by Lady Dove, just as if the beautiful reality of her wedded happiness did not exist.",f
29776,"Mr. Faber had jogged off home in his pony carriage, Toney promising to bring back his dearest Anne as soon as Miss Grossman was able to return to public life.",f
29777,"Toney watched him disappearing down the park as she stood alone on the steps of Aldersfield House, and as she looked at the lovely trees now turning every shade of gold, orange, and red, the Past and the Future appeared to her as two dream figures; the Past was a small, poorly clad beggar, and the Future a big, rich giant, but the beggar had a smile on his face and looked oh, so very happy, whilst the rich giant knitted his brows and looked down sadly on the ground.",f
29778,"""No, no,"" cried the girl, ""the giant is blind and he doesn't see that he has only to give away all those gold brocaded clothes, and then he would be happy!",f
29779,"He shan't be sorrowful, I won't let him!""",f
29780,"A little cold nose at that moment thrust itself into Toney's hand as it hung at her side, and a joyful bark brought her back to reality.",f
29781,"She seized her beloved mongrel in her arms, whereupon he licked her face and showed that he understood her mood.",f
29782,"""Oh, Trick!",f
29783,Trick! we won't wear gold braid on our jackets and we won't let it make us feel sad.,f
29784,St.,f

Toney had set apart two of her new rooms for the secretary, and she looked round to see that all was comfortable before his arrival.",f
29791,"A big knee-hole writing table was so placed that it could look over the park, and there was an easy chair and even a box of cigars for his comfort.",f
29792,"""He'll feel very strange at first,"" she thought, ""and I expect he'll hate messing about this work all day as much as I should if I had to be a private secretary.",f
29793,Gracious stars!,f
29794,What a heap of writing money brings with it.,f
29795,There's a mountain of letters already for him.,f
29796,"I must learn to drive the motor-car and then I'll take out tired workers, that will be nice! if only I can get time for it all.",f
29797,"Life is beautiful, isn't it, Trick?""",f
29798,"Trick wagged his tail and assented, then hearing the carriage wheels they both flew into the hall to receive the new secretary.",f
29799,"Jim was driving the waggonette, and Sir Evas and the young man were inside, and Toney's quick eyes caught sight of her new tall pale secretary.",f
29800,Sir Evas was half smiling as he introduced her.,f

29804,The paper-basket will be the best place for half of them.,f
29805,Uncle Evas has told you all my sins I expect.,f
29806,"Mr. Diggings, will you show Mr. Russell to his room.",f
29807,"Lady Dove isn't visible till lunch time.""",f
29808,"""Thanks,"" said Mr. Plantagenet Russell slowly; he wore an eye-glass in the right eye, and slightly raised the left eyebrow.",f
29809,"So this was the great heiress he had come to work for, he had expected somebody very different.",f
29810,He was not at all pleased with life in general.,f
29811,"He had been brought up in the lap of luxury, when suddenly, just when he was half-way through his college career, his father, a lawyer, died.",f
29812,"Then it was discovered that he had swindled his clients, and that his wife and his only son were penniless.",f
29813,"His mother's brother had given shelter to both, and after trying several clerkships, Mr. Plantagenet Russell had by chance heard of this post, and much to his surprise had obtained it.",f
29814,Plantagenet had thought this would be a far easier life than mere clerkships.,f
29815,"The heiress was, of course, to be beautiful, and he could take life in the leisurely fashion which he deemed to be consistent with his early bringing up.",f
29816,"The disgrace incurred by his father's defalcation weighed heavily on Plantagenet Russell, but he hoped this fact was but little known, and he himself was perfectly trustworthy as far as money was concerned.",f
29817,"Here again life had been very unfair to him, and now he felt taken in because the heiress was so unlike his expectations, her very movements denoted a youthful energy which might prove most inconvenient, and which was not at all consistent with riches.",f
29818,"In Plantagenet's mind to be poor when you had once been rich, was a disgrace very ill deserved.",f
29819,"Lunch time brought the members of Aldersfield together, and Plantagenet's spirits rose when Sir Evas introduced him to Lady Dove.",f
29820,Here was a lady of high degree who knew her own position.,f
29821,"He bowed low and with great deference, and Lady Dove immediately took a liking to him.",f
29822,"She saw that this young man recognised that she was Lady Dove, of Aldersfield House, and she had heard he had once been rich.",f
29823,"""I am glad you are coming to assist my niece, Mr. Russell, with the many duties wealth should entail upon her.",f
29824,"You will, I hope, help her to carry out these duties as she has had very little experience.",f
29825,"Of course those born to wealth know how hardly the duties of it press upon the conscientious mind.""",f
29826,"She looked sympathetically at him, and Plantagenet Russell was comforted.",f
29827,"""I shall endeavour to follow your wishes in all things, Lady Dove,"" said the secretary with another bow.",f
29828,Lady Dove smiled upon him.,f
29829,"A young man who deferred to her wishes warmed her heart, ""so unlike that stuck-up, conceited Lewis Waycott,"" she mentally said.",f
29830,"""I am sure your presence here will be a real satisfaction to my niece"" (since her accession of fortune Toney had been usually spoken of as ""my niece""), ""and she will benefit greatly by having you here.",f
29831,"Do have some of that pheasant, I daresay you will like a little shooting.",f
29832,Sir Evas is so glad of a companion when he goes out with his gun.,f

30470,"She was not mistaken; as she entered she caught sight of five shabby genteel individuals, who were now evidently too much alarmed to do anything more than sit dejectedly in the enclosure of a window.",f

30493,"""Mr.----""  Toney paused, she couldn't say Smith again, but she got no answer, only a nod and another smile.",f
30494,"""He's stone deaf,"" said Miss Smith, who by her manner was trying to show Toney that a clergyman's sister is always a lady, little guessing that Toney cared for none of such things.",f
30495,"""He joined us,"" said Dr. Harris, ""but his infirmity makes it difficult to converse with him, his name is, I believe, Grant--Captain Grant!""",f
30496,"Captain Grant smiled and nodded, and insisted on Toney's reading her own advertisement, by pointing to it line by line with his first finger.",f
30497,"""Yes, of course--Mr. Lang, Captain Grant,"" she introduced the two, and then hurriedly went to the tea-table, where Mrs. Faber was in her old position of tea-maker.",f
30498,"""Chum, dear, I'm plunging about in a bog; give them some tea quickly; that will be to their advantage anyhow.",f

30509,"You must be awfully hungry.""",f
30510,"Toney headed the procession out of the drawing-room, Edward Lang, hurrying to open the door for her, and hiding, as best he could, his amused smile as Toney nodded at him, saying, ""I'll come back soon.""",f
30511,Lady Dove gave a sigh of relief.,f
30512,She was so much annoyed that she forgot her role of kind aunt.,f
30513,"""Antonia is incorrigible.",f
30514,You see how she collects strange people round her.,f

30525,"Good heavens! the girl must be allowed to have her head at first, then she'll soon calm down.""",f
30526,"""Dear Lady Dove,"" said Lady Southbourne, gently laying her pale lavender kid gloved hand on her hostess as a mark of sympathy, ""young people will be young people, I daresay when you were young----""  ""No indeed, I was brought up by a very particular mother, who knew what a young lady should be like.""",f
30527,"""Ah! yes, those were indeed good old days!""",f
30528,"At this moment Toney rushed in again with breathless speed, and addressed herself to Mr. Lang.",f
30529,"""There! it's all right, and they have unfrozen, poor dears.",f
30530,"It's strange, isn't it, how these stately English homes act like cold storage on people.""",f

30537,"You see, Lady Southbourne, I advertised for people in reduced circumstances, and the answers were so many that Mr. Russell couldn't keep ahead.""",f
30538,"""Something to their advantage, and pray what is that, Antonia?",f
30539,"You must have taken leave of your five senses!"" exclaimed Lady Dove, turning pink with vexation.",f
30540,Here Mrs. Faber threw herself into the breach.,f
30541,"""It's only one of Toney's kind schemes, Lady Dove.",f
30542,"I will go and see after the visitors, Toney, if you take my place.""",f
30543,"This happily turned the stream of hot lava from poor Toney, and Lady Dove remarked,  ""It is most tiresome, my companion has influenza.",f
30544,"I generally find, don't you, Lady Southbourne, that middle-class people always give in if even a little finger aches.",f
30545,"Of course, poor things, they do not understand our motto of 'noblesse oblige.'""  The Honourable Edward left the two ladies to their duet over the cowardice of the middle-class, and went to sit by Toney, who was drinking tea in earnest.",f
30546,"""It's rather warm work when you're taken by surprise.",f
30547,"If I had been here it would have been all right,"" she said, smiling once more.",f
30548,"""I think it's always 'all right' where you are,"" said the young man gallantly.",f
30549,Toney looked up suddenly and gazed at him.,f
30550,"""Gracious stars! how awfully nice of you to say that, but it isn't true!",f
30551,I always seem to raise the dust when I come into this room!,f
30552,"Aunt Dove was made of different paste, so somehow we don't blend.",f

30555,"""We are all going to become Socialists, whether we like it or not,"" he said softly.",f
30556,"""You'll exclude Aunt Dove, won't you?"" and Toney's merry laugh sounded through the room.",f
30557,"""So little self-control,"" Lady Dove was heard to murmur.",f
30558,"""That's me!"" said Toney, nodding her head, ""but as you were kind enough just now to overlook my 'bringing up,' as Aunt Dove calls it, I'll tell you about my friends.",f
30559,"I'm going to buy Deep Hollow Farm and build a sort of a Home for stray folk that can't swim against the stream.""",f
30560,"""Will these be your first inmates?""",f
30561,"""Perhaps, Mr. Russell will tabulate them all, and we'll take the worst cases.",f

30566,"Let me see, will you come and help to tabulate?",f
30567,"Mr. Russell groans over the work.""",f
30568,"Mr. Lang had no intention of working hard, but he hid this intention.",f
30569,"""I'm at your commands, Miss Whitburn.""",f
30570,He was wondering in what manner and how soon he could make an offer to Toney!,f
30571,Would she be easily won?,f
30572,He began to fear a title would not be a great attraction.,f
30573,"He would have to go in for Socialism or Individualism or some 'ism, to have a better chance of getting L50,000 a year.",f
30574,"It would be rather fatiguing, but his debts were many, and the money was worth the effort.",f
30575,"Miss Whitburn was not likely to be particular about tying up money, and Sir Evas, her guardian, was very easy-going, and would be glad to get her well married.",f
30576,"So argued Edward Lang, never doubting but that he would be a welcome suitor.",f
30577,Unfortunately many mothers with marriageable daughters were so very kind to him and had spoilt him.,f
30578,"At the bottom he was not a bad fellow, but terribly extravagant.",f
30579,"""Then let me command you to go away,"" said Toney laughing, ""for Aunt Dove won't like me to leave you, and those poor people will find themselves thrown from the frying-pan into the fire.",f
30580,"Mr. Russell will want to tabulate them so minutely.""",f
30581,The Honourable Edward rose quite willingly.,f
30582,"He was afraid of seeing more of Toney's ""friends"" arriving, and in any case he could not very conveniently make love to the heiress in this formal drawing-room.",f
30583,"""If I obey you now, tell me when I may come again?""",f
30584,"""Oh, whenever you like, there's sure to be something going on in the tabulating line for some time to come.""",f
30585,Toney's laugh was catching.,f
30586,"""But I may be rewarded with a talk with you, apart from the genteel beggars,"" he said cheerfully.",f
30587,"""It's all very well laughing at beggars, but if one has nothing one does strange things.",f
30588,"Do you know when I first came here I was a beggar, and not at all genteel, Aunt Dove would tell you--and I was glad to make a whistle for five shillings!""",f
30589,"""Was it a successful whistle?""",f
30590,"""I rather think it was!",f
30591,I believe it was owing to it that General Stone left me his money.,f
30592,"Now do say good-bye, please.""",f
30593,"""_Au revoir_ then, Miss Whitburn, I prefer saying that----  Mother, I really think----""  Lady Southbourne always obeyed her son and rose immediately.",f
30594,"""So delighted to have seen you not looking a bit tired after your delightful party,"" she said to Toney, keeping her hand affectionately in her lavender kid, ""I wish we could stay longer----  Now why not come over and spend a few days at the Towers?",f
30595,"Wouldn't that be delightful, Edward?""",f
30596,"""It would indeed!""",f
30597,Toney shook her head.,f
30598,"""Afraid I can't, thanks; besides, I shouldn't know what to do, and at Aldersfield I've got heaps waiting to be settled.""",f
30599,"""Of course we mustn't be selfish,"" said Lady Southbourne, not taking any notice of Toney's reason for not going to the Towers!",f
30600,"At last they were off, followed by the most gracious remarks of Lady Dove as Toney flew back to her own room.",f
30601,"There she found not only Dr. and Mrs. Harris, Mr. and Miss Smith, and Captain Grant, but also Lewis and Mrs. Faber assisting the visitors to make a square meal; whilst Mr. Russell was tabulating them, every now and then making a dart at one of the individuals to get special answers.",f
30602,"""This is nice!",f
30603,"How kind of you, Mr. Waycott.",f
30604,"Lady Southbourne and the Honourable Edward took so long to go I had to give him a hint.""",f
30605,"""Oh, Toney! what did you say?"" said Mrs. Faber.",f
30606,"""Why I asked him to go and he went.",f

30608,"Our cook is just perfect at veal pies.""",f
30609,"Dr. Harris said he didn't mind if he did have some more, but at that moment Mr. Russell made a dart at Miss Smith.",f
30610,"""What is the date of your birth, Miss Smith?""",f
30611,"Now Miss Smith's age was a hid treasure, and to be asked to dig it up in this public way was more than she could bear.",f
30612,She blushed a vivid purple.,f
30613,"""It's of no consequence whatever, Mr. Russell,"" she said.",f
30614,"""I really have forgotten my birthday.""",f
30615,"Mr. Russell went back and put down ""birthday forgotten.""",f
30616,"""But the year?"" he asked again, feeling his whole _raison d'etre_ depended on that date.",f
30617,"""Let me see--What year were you born, brother?""",f
30618,"Mr. Smith blinked very often as he answered, wishing to spare his sister.",f
30619,"""I think I had better send you these particulars--if there is--any good to be got by them.""",f
30620,"""Oh, never mind,"" said Toney, seeing the difficulty.",f
30621,"""Mr. Russell, please put 'Uncertain.'",f
30622,"It isn't easy to remember, if you are asked suddenly how old one is, is it, Mr. Waycott?""",f
30623,Lewis was stifling a smile.,f
30624,"""I am six-and-twenty, I know, because Aunt Honoria keeps my birthdays and announces my age every year.""",f
30625,"""Your relative knows that a man does not mind,"" said Dr. Harris, ""but ladies have rooted objections to telling their age.""",f
30626,"He bowed to Miss Smith, and Miss Smith giggled softly.",f
30627,"Toney saw the motor drive up, and seized the occasion to dash away.",f
30628,She soon returned.,f
30629,"""Now you shall all be driven to the station, when you are ready, and I do hope you won't regret your journey.",f
30630,"It's been so very, very nice, seeing you.",f
30631,"Just on the day, too, that I have taken the farm.""",f
30632,"By the time they were squeezed into the big motor their faces were wreathed with smiles, especially when Toney had thrust an envelope into each of their hands, murmuring something about ""Just to pay the journey.""",f
30633,"The deaf gentleman opened it publicly, and nearly dropped the five pound note, then nearly all tumbled out again to say ""Thank you,"" but at a sign from Toney Jim flew off as if pursued by the furies.

30637,"""You don't think that money is a little china god that has to be handled carefully.""",f

30724,He's a little down to-day.,f

30754,Lewis surreptitiously watched them going off.,f
30755,It seemed like the last ray of evening sunshine disappearing in the woods.,f
30756,Why should he bother about the money?,f
30757,Why?,f
30758,Then he shook his head.,f
30759,Everyone would say he had married Toney's fifty thousand.,f
30760,His pride rebelled and even a perfectly clear conscience could not conquer it.,f
30761,"""There's a lovely moon so we shan't be benighted,"" said Toney, taking her uncle's arm.",f
30762,"""I say, Toney, we mustn't be late for dinner,"" he said walking quicker.",f

30766,"Brother Juniper, that's the one who didn't speak for six months and played see-saw with the children--well, he once was left alone and he was told to see he cooked some food when the others returned, and he agreed, but when they were gone he thought it was a lot of trouble so much food cooking, so he went begging for food and made a big fire, and borrowed big pots and put all the food he got into it.",f
30767,"Fowls with their feathers on, and eggs with their shells, and the fire was so big that he had to tie a plank on his body to get near the pots.",f
30768,"Then at last he rang the bell and all the brothers came, expecting great things, and he said, 'Eat well, for I have cooked enough for a fortnight, and then we can all go to prayer and think no more about food.'""  ""I hope they enjoyed it!"" said Sir Evas absently.",f
30769,He was thinking of his wife.,f

30778,"Didn't your Brother shorten it ever?""",f
30779,"""No, you see they had time then.",f

30781,"""I don't think I should take the beating so easily!",f

30784,"""Dear old ducky.",f

30787,"""You must remember--Ehem--if you were to marry, of course your husband would help you to get rid of a good lot!""",f
30788,Toney turned the conversation and the two who so well understood each other appeared in the Aldersfield drawing-room just as Lady Dove was telling Mrs. Faber to leave off as it was time to dress.,f
30789,"""Oh, there you are!",f
30790,"Well, I do think, Evas, that you might have returned to tea.",f

30795,"""Indeed, what's that?"" said Sir Evas, pleasantly relieved that the storm was blowing over, whilst Toney leant against the door and listened.",f
30796,"""Lewis is going to marry his cousin Maud.",f
30797,"It is private as yet, but quite understood.""",f
30798,"""Good gracious!",f
30799,"Strange we have not heard it!""",f
30800,"""Oh, you men have no eyes.",f
30801,"At the party I saw them constantly smiling at each other, and Mrs. Hamilton said very pointedly something about young people fancying no one saw their inclinations.",f
30802,I guessed her meaning.,f
30803,"Well, she has been working that way for some years, she means to feather her nest well, but of course it's a pity!""",f
30804,"Without knowing what he was doing, Sir Evas turned towards Toney, and to his surprise he found her gone.",f
30805,"""Well,"" he said, ""I always thought he liked Toney!",f
30806,"But it's no use meddling with such things.""",f
30807,Upstairs Toney was sitting on her window-sill with Trick in her arms.,f
30808,"She had locked her door, and for the first time in her life there was no smile on her lips at the thought of Lewis Waycott.",f
30809,"""Oh, I am glad, I must be glad that he will be happy,"" she said to herself, ""but I wish he had told me himself, though she is a nice girl and will sort of do all he wishes.""",f
30810,"Then she laid her head against Trick's face and whispered, ""Trick, Trick, you'll not leave your mistress, will you, dear?",f

After great events there is always a certain feeling of flatness, and it must have been that which made Toney somewhat silent and plunge at times into the tabulating work with furious energy.",f
30812,"Lewis Waycott came every morning and, to everybody's surprise, the Hon.",f
30813,Edward often turned up too.,f
30814,"It really was amusing to see the self-made secretaries each in front of a book and a pile of letters, whilst Plantagenet Russell indolently ""bossed the show,"" as Toney remarked.",f
30815,"Before he had worked long Edward Lang's labours were transmuted into conversation, and he always found an excellent excuse for luring Toney out into the park or the garden; strange to say, Toney did not seem to object, and left Lewis and Plantagenet at their task without too many apologies.",f
30816,"The feeling of needing a good stretch came upon her, and though she would have preferred solitude, Edward Lang's thirst for information served her purpose.",f
30817,"When Lewis was gone, however, then she returned to the tabulating work with increased energy, and the Hon.",f
30818,Edward's wishes could not drag her away.,f
30819,"She said to herself she missed her chum, and that the world was a bit awry without her sweet sympathy, but she manfully fought against these feelings, flying to her ""Little Flowers"" for strength when she felt extra depressed.",f
30820,"She liked reading about Brother John, of Alverina, who had entered the Order as a boy, ""But seeing that God careth with tender care for His children, giving them at divers times, now consolation, and now tribulation, now prosperity, and now adversity, according as He seeth they have need thereof, for to continue in humility, or for to kindle more in them desire for heavenly things,"" Brother John remained without the light and love of God, and this so afflicted him that he took to running hither and thither about the woods, till at last he had a vision of Christ and after many entreaties, the gift of divine grace returned to him.",f
30821,"""All work and no play, Toney, will make you dull, a day's hunting will do you a world of good,"" said Sir Evas one day.",f
30822,"""I'll come with you, and Colon wants exercise.",f
30823,"The meet is at the Towers.""",f
30824,Toney looked up quickly.,f
30825,"""It's you, uncle, who want to hunt, but of course I'll come.",f
30826,"Mr. Waycott will help Mr. Russell to-day, and perhaps a good blow will clear away my cobwebs.",f
30827,"We're getting so puzzled as to who's the most needy and deserving, that we seriously think of raffling them.""",f
30828,"""I hope Waycott won't give up his hunting for your beggars, Toney.",f
30829,"Anyhow, we'll start early to-morrow.""",f
30830,It was a real joy to see Toney hunting; she sat her horse as if she were part and parcel of the steed and certainly there was perfect sympathy between them.,f
30831,"The county gentlemen, who now and then spoke hard words about some of the Dianas of the hunting field, were lost in admiration as they saw Toney's seat, and Sir Evas felt immensely proud of the praises bestowed upon his niece.",f
30832,"That this young huntress was an heiress added to the admiration, and Toney found herself surrounded with a little court of followers, foremost among them was, of course, Edward Lang.",f
30833,"He meant to try his luck to-day, and was therefore delighted at seeing her at the meet, but how was he to find his opportunity?",f
30834,"Toney looked as if cobwebs were swept away judging by her face as she and Sir Evas joined the meet, indeed, she looked a perfect picture as she and Colon impatiently waited to be off though talking to Edward Lang.",f
30835,"""Colon is nearly perfect.",f
30836,"Uncle Evas bought him when he became my guardian, and I don't think there is a better judge of horses in all England.""",f
30837,"""That is a rare talent.",f
30838,"You'll lunch here of course, Miss Whitburn?""",f
30839,"""I think we shall need fortifying.",f
30840,"Oh, now they're off!",f
30841,"I feel as if we should fly over everything.""",f
30842,"And, indeed, it looked like it, for Toney and Colon were soon flying across country in grand style.",f
30843,"Sir Evas presently gave up trying to keep up with her, five-barred gates were not for him now, though in his youth he had been a mighty hunter.",f
30844,"""Look at Miss Whitburn taking that hedge!",f
30845,"By jove!"" exclaimed one of the young men.",f
30846,"""Did you see her take that wide ditch?",f
30847,"It was magnificent, and there's no show-off; it's just because she and her thorough-bred forget everything that it's so splendid.""",f
30848,"Edward Lang even had not been able to keep up with Toney, but you can't make a proposal flying over a gate, so he comforted himself with thinking,  ""Australia ought to be proud of having reared her; anyhow, a girl who rides like that can be trusted not to give way to too many fads.""",f
30849,"No need to describe a hunting morning in that county, it has all been done before, and best by those who have themselves known the full excitement of a splendid run.",f
30850,"To Toney it seemed to give new life and happiness, but she never was too much excited to forget that this was only an interlude.",f
30851,"She and her father had had many a day's hard riding, and he had taught her so young that the word or feeling of fear did not even enter into her composition; and, besides this, Colon was a thoroughbred to be proud of.",f
30852,"He understood the run as well or better than she did, and seemed endowed with miraculous powers of clearing everything that came in his way, whilst a soft pat from a loving hand was reward enough.",f
30853,"It must be owned that though the masculine gender applauded, some of the hunting ladies were somewhat jealous.",f
30854,"""Of course,"" said a pretty girl to Edward Lang, ""if you get a thorough-bred like that you can do anything, it depends on the horse.""",f
30855,Her own was evidently a hack of moderate powers.,f
30856,He shook his head.,f
30857,"""I fear it isn't all the horse, Miss Symons;",f
30858,"Miss Whitburn has a superb seat.""",f
30859,"""They say she was originally a circus rider,"" answered Miss Symons;",f

30861,The Honble.,f
30862,Edward winced a little.,f
30863,He meant to propose to-day and this remark affected him disagreeably.,f
30864,Would his wife have to live down these queer reports?,f
30865,"""I never heard that report,"" he said smiling, ""but if I had been the owner of the circus I would not have let Miss Whitburn leave me.",f
30866,"Her father was a doctor in Australia.""",f
30867,"""Oh, Australia!",f
30868,They are queer people there!,f
30869,"Descendants of convicts, aren't they?""",f
30870,"At this moment the dogs were seen in full cry, the fox had been dislodged and part of the hunt came flying back across a field hard by.",f
30871,"Toney was close behind, and at that moment Miss Symons and Edward Lang saw her and Colon leap over a gate that would have been avoided by all the ladies and most of the men.",f
30872,"""By Jove!",f
30873,"That was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,"" exclaimed Edward Lang, looking towards Toney and leaving the disconsolate Miss Symons to answer her own question.",f
30874,To his amusement Toney drew rein and came to meet him and her uncle.,f
30875,"""Uncle Evas, you look as if you wanted your lunch.",f
30876,Wasn't it splendatious?,f
30877,"Colon just flies!""",f
30878,"""Don't stop your Pegasus for me, Toney.""",f
30879,"""But I want to.",f
30880,"How far is it to the Towers, Mr. Lang? and then we have to get home.""",f
30881,"""I quite agree; besides the fox has got into Red Hollow and will escape.",f
30882,"They always do in Red Hollow.""",f
30883,Toney smiled.,f
30884,"""He deserves it.",f
30885,"But it does make one happy, doesn't it?""",f
30886,"The three trotted back to the Towers, Edward Lang was rather silent, wondering how he should propose.",f
30887,"He heartily wished Toney were as easily approached as Miss Symons, who was always lifting her sad sweet eyes to his.",f
30888,"The breakfast was a joy to the hungry, and Lady Southbourne all amiability to Toney and Sir Evas.",f
30889,"He had nothing to mar his enjoyment, and even managed not to think of Melina at home.",f
30890,"All luncheon time Edward could think of nothing more original than discussing the hunt, but as so many of the male guests would chat with Toney and all were enthusiastic over her riding, he only succeeded in carrying her off to the conservatory when the horses were at the door.",f
30891,It does not help matters if you feel there must be no delay over your proposal.,f
30892,"""You just eclipsed all the girls on the hunting field, Miss Whitburn,"" he began, as he picked some lovely flowers at random.",f
30893,"""I do hope you'll come again soon.",f
30894,"Why haven't we seen you oftener--I--I----""  Hunting and love don't dovetail easily, and Toney was sniffing hard at some flowers quite unconscious of what was coming.",f
30895,"""I shan't have much time, but Colon loves it;",f
30896,"I love the exercise too, but I'm not sure about the fox!""",f
30897,"""You are too much of a sportswoman to join the squeamish set.""",f

30900,"I wish England didn't feel so small, but one gets used to being cooped up, and it's very good discipline.""",f
30901,"""You are too young and too beautiful to talk of discipline,"" he murmured.",f
30902,"Toney took her face out of a bush of sweet azaleas and looked at him in amazement, so he continued very quickly,  ""Of course you must know that _I_ think so, and that I--I--want to know if you will let me tell you I love you?",f
30903,"Upon my word, I--do hope you'll give me a chance.",f
30904,"Mother is awfully fond of you too, and in fact, will you be my wife?""",f
30905,"Never, never had Edward found it so difficult to compose a speech worthy of the occasion.",f

30976,She held out her letter which certainly contained a draft for two hundred pounds.,f
30977,Jeanie walked in with a similar letter in her hand.,f

30979,"Imagine such a thing happening to us!""",f
30980,"""Seaton Hamilton must have found a gold mine!",f
30981,"When was the last time he wrote to you?""",f
30982,"""It was just when--Jeanie was playing with----""  Maud left off, she must not mention the discarded lover, but Jeanie blushed as she murmured,  ""Mother is always right!",f
30983,"She said he would remember us when he was rich, and he has.""",f
30984,"Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Honoria entered together, and there was a chorus from the girls whilst Lewis stood by the fire smiling.",f
30985,"""Really, Delia, this is the first time I have known your prophecy to come true.",f
30986,"And he puts it nicely,"" said Miss Honoria.",f
30987,"""I wonder he doesn't sign his name,"" said Lewis.",f
30988,"""So full of good feeling.",f
30989,"He always admired you two girls so much,"" said their mother.",f
30990,"""Poor Seaton, money was always like water in his hands.""",f
30991,"""Nonsense, Lewis, he never had any, so your simile is quite wrong, but I always said he _would_ make money some day, and would remember the girls.""",f
30992,"""Let's eat our breakfast in his honour then,"" said Lewis, sitting down.",f
30993,"""Shall you accept it, Jeanie?""",f
30994,"""Of course.",f
30995,"Mother, when can we start?""",f
30996,"""We must thank him first; but isn't it tiresome there is no address except that of the Argentine lawyer?"" said Maud.",f
30997,"""You must thank him then,"" said Lewis, ""he'll pass it on.""",f
30998,"""I think Lewis does not half believe,"" said Jeanie.",f
30999,"""I believe in the money as the cheque looks good enough; to me the miracle seems to be in Seaton.",f
31000,"He never could make money, and wasn't very generous.""",f
31001,"""How could he be on nothing?",f
31002,Poor Seaton!,f
31003,"I always believed in him,"" repeated Mrs. Hamilton, ""but I don't think Maud can go to Germany just now.""",f
31004,"They discussed this some time when suddenly Lewis exclaimed,  ""Why there is Toney cantering across the park!",f
31005,"You must tell her of your good fortune.""",f
31006,Lewis went to the front door to warn her.,f
31007,"She ran up the steps leaving Jim to hold the horses, and Lewis thought he had never seen her looking so happy.",f
31008,"""Will you forgive me coming so early?""",f
31009,"""Forgive you?",f
31010,"Why, it's a great pleasure to see you, Toney.""",f
31011,"""Is it?",f
31012,"Well, that is nice of you.",f
31013,"I never know if people care----""  What an opportunity!",f
31014,"Lewis nearly said, ""I care more for you than for anybody in the world,"" but the fifty thousand a year popped up before his mental vision like a number on a music hall platform.",f
31015,"""Everybody does,"" he altered it to, ""but I came to tell you that Maud and Jeanie are in the seventh heaven of delight over poor Seaton Hamilton's gift of two hundred pounds each.",f
31016,"You are too generous, Toney.""",f
31017,"""You are glad, aren't you?",f
31018,You won't scold me?,f
31019,I know you like Maud to have advantages.,f

31021,"""Of course, but what brings you?",f
31022,"Has Lady Dove given you notice to quit?""",f
31023,Toney laughed.,f
31024,"""Oh no, not yet; but she is very angry because--another _avant garde_ came yesterday--such a quaint little old maid whose father was at Balaclava, and then finished up all his money before he died, and she has kept her mother for years by working at a little school, and now she is going blind.""",f
31025,"""Did one little old maid rouse her anger?""",f
31026,"""Somehow it did, when it really was an honour to shake hands with Miss Phipps; but I want to know if I may have the farm at once and rig it up for interviews.",f
31027,"I could put Miss Phipps and her mother there, and she could be sort of interviewing secretary.""",f
31028,"""But you say she can't see?""",f
31029,"""Her mother could see for her and they could do it between them.",f
31030,"Mr. Staines is so slow about the lease, and he and your lawyer are having _chasse croise_ about everything, and--if you don't mind lending it to me straight off till it's paid for we could send an army of work-people and do it up from top to toe.""",f
31031,"Lewis looked at her bright eager face, and he felt it was also an honour to shake hands with her, but he could say nothing but,  ""Of course you shall have it, only it's giving in to Lady Dove's selfishness.""",f
31032,"""Pups said it was not seeing through other people's eyes that made us selfish.",f
31033,"I read last night about Brother Leo's dream, and I did wish Aunt Dove could hear it, but she would think it rubbish.",f
31034,"He saw a lot of brothers with loads on their backs trying to cross a river, some got half-way and some nearly to the shore, but in the end all were drowned; and then he saw others with no loads and they got over easily, and St.",f
31035,"Francis explained that the loads were the riches which they could not forsake.""",f
31036,"""Lady Dove has a pretty good heavy load, I fancy!"" said Lewis rather savagely.",f
31037,"""I'm sure Pups hadn't any.",f
31038,That's why he got to the other side so easily.,f
31039,"Then I may see about the farm this very day, may I?""",f
31040,"""Yes, this very day, I'll come with you directly after breakfast; but come in and hear about the Argentine cousin.""",f
31041,"""You swear to keep the secret, won't you, Mr. Waycott?""",f
31042,"""Certainly, by the seven gods if you like.""",f
31043,"As the two entered the dining-room, Miss Honoria thought she had never seen two faces looking so perfectly happy.",f
31044,"Never had Jeanie Hamilton appeared so much excited as she did now as both sisters recounted their good fortune, to which Toney listened with a smile on her lips.",f
31045,"""It will pay for a whole course of Herr Ludowic.",f
31046,"Imagine such luck!""",f
31047,"""Jeanie is really worth the lessons, but I'm not,"" said Maud humbly.",f
31048,"""I think she had better have it all and then she can become a professional.""",f
31049,"""Cousin Seaton wouldn't like that,"" said Mrs. Hamilton;",f
31050,"""you can keep it and see what you really want.",f
31051,"I always said he would make money and that he had a generous heart,"" and Toney put in,  ""If he has made a lot I expect he finds it just a great pleasure to give it away.",f
31052,"Now I'll go on to the farm and take notes.""",f
31053,"The farm was a most picturesque place with old black woodwork outside, and within panelled rooms with lattice windows, but it all needed repainting and papering.",f
31054,"Toney was in her element, as pencil in hand, she planned out something very pretty.",f
31055,"She had not done before Lewis appeared, and with his help she put down the names of the tradesmen she should apply to to transform the old farm into something that would be very pretty and attractive, and where some of the future dwellers in Toney's palace should lodge.",f
31056,"""I am going to call the palace 'Stone House' after my General,"" she said, ""and you must name the farm, as it is really your gift.""",f
31057,"""My gift when I am selling it for a handsome sum!",f
31058,"It will be a chapel of ease I think.""",f
31059,Toney laughed.,f
31060,"""Indeed it won't.",f
31061,Everybody connected with it will work hard.,f
31062,Pups said hard work was like salt to dried herrings!,f
31063,But I do wish we could get on with the palace.,f
31064,"It's going to be built of stone of course, with mullion windows and airy rooms, and very hygienic and--oh, I must ride home, for Mr. Russell will be wanting me.",f
31065,"He takes Aunt Dove's part, and she is really quite nice to him.""",f
31066,At that moment Maud made her appearance.,f
31067,"Her mother had sent her to invite Toney to lunch, but in the back of her mind it was to report how Lewis conducted himself with the heiress.",f
31068,Maud found them only busy over the names of many tradesmen.,f
31069,"""I'm glad you came,"" exclaimed Toney, but not laughing.",f
31070,"""I want you to help Mr. Waycott to choose a name for the farm.",f
31071,"It will be nice if you both help.""",f
31072,"Maud was beginning to admire Toney very much; ever since the birthday party she always took her part when her mother and Jeanie abused her, and now here was Toney saying something so nice.",f
31073,"At that moment, however, the Squire's agent came to call him away on business.",f
31074,"""Oh, Toney, it will be lovely to have your palace so near to Lewis, because he does take so much interest in it.""",f
31075,"""It is very good of him and you.",f
31076,"If you both care it will get on.""",f
31077,"Maud wondered why Toney put it like that; happily, Mrs. Hamilton had not let Maud become acquainted with her plans, and as she herself had never seen any attention, other than cousinly, on Lewis' side, the idea of marrying him had not entered her head.",f
31078,In this Mrs. Hamilton had shown her talent.,f
31079,"She knew Lewis would resent the idea of having his wife chosen for him, but some day he would fall in with the idea and all would be well, but it did no harm to prepare the matrimonial path by telling other people about it.",f
31080,"""Toney, dear, I want to make a confession to you,"" said Maud, leaning against the gate whilst Toney sat on the top of it.",f
31081,"""Confession to me!",f
31082,"I'm the worst person, for if I were a Roman Catholic priest I would never listen to confessions, but absolve them all.",f
31083,"I should feel rather mean to hear people's bad thoughts, wouldn't you?""",f
31084,"""Well, you must listen.",f
31085,"I think we were all horrid about you, I don't know why, at least I think when you first came I was rather jealous of you.""",f
31086,"""Jealous of me when I first came!",f
31087,"Why, I was only a poor relation.""",f
31088,"""Yes, but you could ride and play tennis, and you always said things straight out, which I never, never can!""",f
31089,"""It was only Pups' teaching.""",f
31090,"""But I want to say I've changed my mind, Toney, and I do like you very much now, and will you let me help you in your work?",f
31091,Jeanie and I do seem to lead such useless lives.,f
31092,Of course now with Cousin Seaton's present it will be better.,f
31093,"Jeanie will go and get really good lessons and be a success, and I shall give her my share, as it will be much better for her, and then I thought that perhaps you would let me help with your poor people.""",f
31094,"""Well, now that is scrumptious of you, Maud; you're the first woman that ever wanted to help except Crumpet, and she's got her Henry.",f
31095,"If you really mean it, you could come and help Miss Phipps here.",f
31096,"Mr. Waycott laughs because she's nearly blind--and there'll be so much to do at first about accounts and other things.""",f
31097,"""Let's call it 'The Haven.'""  ""Yes, and you shall visit the Haven every day.",f
31098,"That will be beautiful, and you won't mind being a paid official, will you, as I think paid work is more satisfactory.",f
31099,"I'll give you one hundred pounds a year, and it will be a real, real help.""",f
31100,"""Oh, Toney! but----  Yes, I won't be proud because the money will be so useful to me.",f
31101,It is silly our being afraid of saying we are poor.,f
31102,"Since I've known you, Toney, I see how foolish we are.""",f
31103,"Toney took her hand and clasped it  ""That's a token of our agreement.",f
31104,"The Kanakas did that when I tried to make them promise to leave off a bad habit; but I think they liked clasping hands, as they so often forgot and had to begin again!""",f
31105,"They both laughed, and Maud's eyes began to shine with new hope and pleasure.",f
31106,She was going to be useful.,f
31107,"""And there's another thing I want to ask you about.",f
31108,"You know Jeanie always looks so miserable; well, it's because she is constantly thinking of Frank Weston.",f
31109,"She rejected him because he wasn't a gentleman born, I used to think she was right, but now--I begin to feel it's we that were silly and foolish.",f
31110,How can it matter what a man is by birth so that he's _really nice_.,f
31111,"You don't know what a wonderful musician he is, and what a very, very nice man.",f
31112,"I think Jeanie broke his heart, or nearly, and I believe she is breaking hers, as she is so cross if I mention him.",f
31113,"Oh, Toney, can you help her?",f
31114,You got Miss Crump married.,f
31115,"Lewis says it was all your doing.""",f
31116,"""Gracious stars! but I do love a real, real romance.",f
31117,"Of course I'd marry a pig-sticker if he was real nice, but I'm not a Hamilton--I'm only just Toney Whitburn.",f
31118,"But, Maud, let's think out a solution, and thank you very, very much for being so nice to me!",f
31119,"I'll never be jealous of you!""",f
31120,"""Jealous of me!--how could you be, Toney?""                                                                       The transformation of the farm seemed to take place by magic, for Toney spared neither trouble nor money.",f
31121,"She wished to have some place where her visitors might be received with kindness and courtesy, two things which were a very uncertain quantity at Aldersfield, that is if Lady Dove was in the vicinity.",f
31122,"Besides all this time, Toney was constantly writing to the architect about plans for ""Stone House,"" and to Mr. Staines about the purchase of the land.",f
31123,"It was in all these ways that the girl's real ability was soon visible; what she did not understand she grappled with till, as she expressed it, daylight came.",f
31124,"Even Mr. Russell began to feel that his employer was not only a mere girl with whims and fancies, for that had been his first opinion of her.",f
31125,"He was often surprised at the grasp she had of subjects not included in a young lady's education, and a faint spark of enthusiasm began to appear occasionally in his work.",f
31126,"Certainly there was a great deal of secretarial work to do, but Toney's masterly scribbles on the letters to be answered were seldom at fault, though expressed in somewhat quaint fashion.",f
31127,"She appeared to remember cases in an extraordinary manner without their being tabulated, for she possessed a royal memory, bred of early training and a perfectly healthy life.",f
31128,"Ten days later Toney rode off alone to the farm to see to last touches, for Miss Phipps and her mother were to come that very afternoon.",f
31129,"The door was opened by Mrs. Thomas, who had been a cook, and Mary, now a tall girl, was to wait on the ladies, whilst Mr. Thomas was to see after the garden and make himself generally useful.",f
31130,"As the whole family adored Toney, there was no fear of the wheels not going round easily.",f
31131,She had made them think they themselves were going to confer great benefits.,f
31132,"""I do think, Miss Tonia, everything is ready!"" said Mrs. Thomas.",f
31133,"""And I've put flowers in the sitting-room,"" added Mary.",f
31134,"""I knew you would wish them to have flowers.""",f
31135,"""And we shall have a fine dairy, miss,"" added Thomas, ""'twill supply all your big house when it's built.""",f
31136,"They all accepted Miss Tonia's big house quite naturally, and they all meant to have a hand in its success.",f
31137,"Toney made a last inspection, her quick eyes seeing everything.",f
31138,Then she returned alone into the parlour to await Maud who had gone to meet Miss Phipps.,f
31139,"Toney and Trick sat on the wide window seat looking into the garden, in which beautiful chrysanthemums were to be seen, and curled up here with Trick in her arms she had a good think.",f
31140,"It was very sweet of Maud to want to help her, she loved her for it, and she loved her because Lewis loved her, and the two would perfect as master and mistress of beautiful Waycott Hall with all its art treasures.",f
31141,"It was very nice of Lewis never to have thought of money at all, as Lady Dove had formerly said he would, it showed he was what Toney had always thought him, one of King Arthur's knights.",f
31142,"She did wish they had told her herself because she could have assured them how perfect she thought it, and she would try to be awfully nice to Maud for his sake.",f
31143,"Of course it was his influence that had made her so much nicer, and now so willing to join in Toney's work.",f
31144,"As for herself, her work was marked out quite plainly, and she must think of nothing else; it would be years before it would run on all fours, and till then she must keep a watchful eye over everything and must not think of personal pleasure.",f
31145,"Then she would be following in her father's footsteps, and doing her duty to her neighbour as General Stone had expected of her.",f
31146,The bright face was quite grave as she leant against Trick's shaggy locks.,f
31147,"The burden felt just a wee bit heavy this morning, and the future, just like a hill that went up and up a long, long way, and no top visible at this moment.",f
31148,Then suddenly she shook herself and Trick to get rid of these grey thoughts.,f
31149,"""I do wish Pups could appear to me as the Brothers of Poverello did so often to each other.",f
31150,"I shouldn't be a bit afraid, as of course he is working hard somewhere, and of course he sees me and does care about my work.",f
31151,"But the Brothers of Poverello were so very, very good and always praying, so that they were fit to see the saints, and I'm not.""",f
31152,"At this moment, happily for Toney's spirits, a fly drove up and she flew to receive her first visitors.",f
31153,Maud was there looking quite transformed from the discontented girl she had been into a woman with a purpose.,f
31154,"""Here we are, Toney, and Mrs. and Miss Phipps are very cold and tired after their journey.""",f
31155,"Then all Toney's sadness flew away like a bird of evil omen, and she was once more the joyous creature that scattered delight about her.",f
31156,"Mary Thomas was helping the ladies as if they were princesses, and Thomas was dealing with their boxes, and Mrs. Thomas was saying that tea was ready in the dining-room.",f
31157,"Mrs. Phipps was a bustling, kind old lady devoted to her nearly blind daughter and telling her how beautiful everything was, and Miss Phipps was as cheerful as possible, talking and praising everything.",f
31158,"""The work will be quite easy,"" said Toney, ""and Miss Hamilton will look in every day to help you, and there are four spare rooms for anyone who wants to come and have a real good time, and you will make them very happy I know, and Mary is just a treasure.""",f
31159,"So the party sat down to tea, and they made Mrs. Phipps take the head of the table because this was her home now, and she was to entertain everybody who came, and she looked quite capable of it, and already vastly proud of her position.",f
31160,"And yet a month ago the workhouse had been staring them in the face, because all their little savings had gone.",f
31161,"But they did not feel like paupers here, they were to work hard so as to make less fortunate folks as happy as they were.",f
31162,"At last Toney rose and said good-bye, and Mrs. Phipps murmured some very grateful words, but Miss Phipps just took Toney's hand and kissed it, and Toney felt a tear on her hand, so she ran away, quickly followed by Maud.",f
31163,"They were going down by the lane across to Waycott Hall, and for a few minutes they were silent, then Toney exclaimed,  ""Gracious stars!",f
31164,"Maud, aren't my Poverelli just ready-made saints, and it's so dreadful their thanking me, and I can't explain to them exactly how it's really nothing to do with me, but with General Stone, and really also Mr. Waycott, who let me have all this land and this lovely farm, and you too for helping me.",f
31165,"Do you know it's so awfully nice you two being sort of bound up together in a work.""",f
31166,"""We two?""",f
31167,"""Yes, you know, you and--your cousin.""",f
31168,"""Oh, Lewis, you mean.",f
31169,"I do think he is so very--I suppose I oughtn't to say so because he's my cousin--but he has altered so much, and thinks such a lot about his people now, I can't understand it.""",f
31170,"""I always think he is one of Arthur's knights, and not a bit proud or stuck-up, though of course he might be, living as he does at Waycott Hall, which is so beautiful.",f
31171,"I like to think of--the future.""",f
31172,"Toney paused, she dared not go on as Maud wouldn't tell her straight out.",f
31173,"""Well, I am thinking of the present, Toney!",f
31174,You can't think how the idea of working has done me good.,f
31175,"I told mother that Lewis had sold you the farm, and she is quite pleased at my helping you.",f
31176,"I didn't tell her about your giving me a salary for it, as she has old-fashioned ideas, but you know we are poor, and I do want it.""",f
31177,"""Of course I know.""",f
31178,"Toney said to herself, ""She wants to save for her trousseau, and it's quite right of her to work for it.""",f
31179,"""I do mean to be in earnest this time,"" continued Maud, ""looking back I never seem to have done anything in downright real earnest as you have, not even my music--Jeanie was the cleverest, and I knew I could never be first-rate as she will be if she works.""",f
31180,"""But now of course you will have a real reason for bucking up.",f
31181,"Wanting to be a little like Pups helps me awfully.""",f
31182,"""My father wasn't like yours, he somehow spent all our money.""",f
31183,"""But you will want to be like your cousin,"" said Toney, making an effort, trying to rub this idea well into Maud.",f
31184,Of course she must become worthy to be the mistress of Waycott Hall!,f
31185,"""Yes, seeing Lewis so much in earnest is a real help.",f
31186,"By the way, Toney, as I was walking here I met Mr. Lang, and I asked him why he hadn't been to tabulate lately!""",f
31187,"""Did you?",f
31188,"He's had enough of it,"" said Toney, pretending Trick was lost and needed a loud whistle.",f
31189,"""He seemed rather low, and said you didn't want him any more, and--he really is a nice fellow, Toney.",f
31190,Do you know that someone told mother that he wanted to marry you!,f
31191,"I wonder if he does?""",f
31192,"""Not _me_!"" said Toney laughing.",f
31193,"""Aunt Dove is quite right, no one would care to marry me, only General Stone's money.",f
31194,"I'm not sweet and pretty like you and Silvia Hales, and I'm not anything of a lady, and your mother sort of sniffs at me I know!""",f
31195,Toney laughed very happily.,f
31196,"""We were brought up to think ladylike ways covered all our sins.",f
31197,"I see it differently now, and I don't mean to be a slave of that idea any longer.""",f
31198,Toney suddenly pulled a newspaper cutting out of her pocket.,f

31200,"I've got an idea.""",f
31201,"She handed Maud an account of the splendid reception given to the great musician, Frank Weston, in London.",f

31210,"Two people do just the same things, and yet because one is born a lord he can do it and people praise him, and the other man whose father was an honest tradesman is sniffed at.""",f
31211,"""Yes, it is foolish.",f

Jeanie and Maud Hamilton shared a bedroom at Waycott Hall, and out of this opened a pretty sitting-room where they practised their music and wrote their letters.",f
31257,The next morning Jeanie was reading an invitation written especially to her by Toney.,f
31258,Maud had brought it up to her.,f
31259,"It ran thus:--   ""MY DEAR JEANIE,  ""Aunt Dove is giving a concert here next week.",f
31260,Will you come as you are so musical?,f
31261,A violinist is coming and perhaps you will like to play too afterwards?,f

31263,I shan't know if it's good or bad.,f

31265,Please come.,f
31266,"Aunt Dove says she loves Dvorak, but Uncle Evas declares she has never heard anything by him.",f
31267,"Anyhow, bring your violin and you can play when the visitors have gone.",f
31268,"""YOUR AFFECTIONATE TONEY.""",f

31270,"""Why can't Toney send out proper cards of invitation like other people?""",f
31271,"""She thinks you are a great player and sends you a special note.",f
31272,"It will be nice to go and spend the night there, won't it?""",f
31273,Maud looked out of the window and not at her sister.,f

31300,"""Of course he can't forget the--the snubbing he got.""",f
31301,"""I want to practise,"" said Jeanie, and seizing her violin she drowned further remarks in wild melody.",f
31302,Her sore heart could find relief only in music.,f
31303,"Yes, she knew well enough now she was fretting her life away in useless regrets.",f
31304,Maud crept away with a smile on her lips.,f
31305,Would Toney succeed?,f
31306,"Frank Weston did not know that the Hamiltons were staying near Aldersfield House, he could never guess he would meet face to face his old love who had used him so ill.",f
31307,"If he knew, Maud felt sure he would at once throw up the engagement, for he could afford to please himself.",f
31308,Maud seized her hat and went off to the Haven as she did every morning now.,f
31309,"It seemed the nicest hour of the day, for there it really was a haven of peace.",f

31312,"She was arranging for three new inmates, the deaf Captain Grant and Mr. and Mrs. Harris, and the Phipps were full of plans for their comfort.",f
31313,Toney had indeed chosen well.,f
31314,"To-day, when their business was done, Toney seized on Maud.",f
31315,"""Come along and lunch with us, I want to show you all the arrangements for our romance.",f
31316,"I do hope it will succeed, only you must help me, Maud.""",f
31317,Then Maud related what had taken place that morning.,f
31318,"""That is all on the right road.",f
31319,Aunt Dove is delighted because all 'our county friends' are coming.,f
31320,Can't think why lords and ladies please her so much.,f

31322,"""There is Lewis,"" exclaimed Maud.",f
31323,"""Oh, Toney, do tell him.""",f
31324,Toney was not surprised.,f
31325,"Of course Lewis Waycott knew Maud went every day to the Haven, and of course he sort of happened to be often in the way.",f

31331,"Only 'Sound the loud timbrel' sort of thing keeps me awake, but I guess I'll keep awake to-morrow because----""  ""Why, pray?""",f
31332,"""You are safe I know, Mr. Waycott, and I want you both to know.""",f
31333,"""Both?"" asked Lewis.",f
31334,"""Yes, you and Maud of course, you will both be so pleased--if it succeeds.""",f
31335,"""What is this surprise, Toney?",f
31336,"I am a little nervous,"" and Lewis laughed.",f

31346,Toney!,f
31347,"What do you think will happen then?""",f
31348,"""He'll speak through his violin.",f
31349,"Books always say that, though that language would be of no use to me!""",f
31350,"""I don't think a musician could make you an offer, Toney,"" said Maud laughing, ""you would hurt his tenderest feelings.""",f

31352,"""And what will happen next, Toney?"" said Lewis, ""pray tell us.""",f

31362,"""But you'll just both help me, won't you, and make people talk and introduce anybody to anybody.",f
31363,"It takes too much time to remember who may speak to who, according to Aunt Dove, that it's better to forget it all.""",f
31364,"""Poor county!",f
31365,"You are going against its most cherished ideas,"" said Lewis, secretly glorying in Toney's courage.",f

31371,Good-bye.,f
31372,"You'll have a nice walk home.""",f
31373,"Toney disappeared swiftly as usual, and Lewis walked a few minutes in silence by his cousin, considering why Toney classed them together so pointedly.",f
31374,"Maud had not noticed it, her mind was full of another idea.",f
31375,"""Oh, Lewis, I believe Mr. Lang is in love with Toney!",f
31376,"Wouldn't it be lovely if she became chief lady in the county!""",f
31377,"""Edward Lang!",f
31378,What nonsense!,f
31379,"Who said it?""",f
31380,Lewis dug his stick into the ground rather savagely.,f
31381,"""I put two and two together.""",f
31382,"""Do you think Toney would--marry him?""",f
31383,"""If she could be persuaded he cared about her and not her money.""",f
31384,"""But does he?""",f
31385,"""I think you are prejudiced against him.",f
31386,"He is rather a nice fellow.""",f
31387,"""I wish you girls wouldn't use the word nice for everything,"" said Lewis somewhat crossly; but Maud's answer was cut short by the appearance of her mother as they walked up on to the terrace of Waycott Hall.",f
31388,"""I've just persuaded Jeanie to accept Antonia's invitation.",f
31389,"I hear the county is coming and they expect something good, but no one knows.",f
31390,"Do you, Maud?""",f
31391,"""Toney wants it to be a secret,"" said Maud.",f
31392,"""Ah, I see, you two always take Toney's side.",f
31393,"Maud, what a colour you have.",f
31394,"Morning walks agree with you, don't you think so, Lewis?""",f
31395,Lewis looked up and noticed how pretty Maud was looking.,f

31397,"""You silly boy!",f
31398,"I don't want my girls to be beauties.""",f
31399,"""Then you must find out some way of stopping it!",f
31400,"Jeanie's pensive air is most becoming, and Maud----""  ""Ah! poor Jeanie, I think Germany will cure her low spirits.""",f
31401,Lewis remarked he had to go to town on business that afternoon but he could be back for the concert.,f
31402,He wanted to get rid of his ill-temper.,f
31403,Maud's unfortunate remark had been the cause of it.,f
31404,Would someone else seize the prize he was too proud to win--and would that someone else be Edward Lang?,f
31405,Certainly fine feelings would not stop him trying to grasp at wealth.,f
31406,Maud was dreadfully restless that afternoon and insisted on Jeanie turning out her wardrobe to see what suitable dress she should wear.,f
31407,"""Your pale blue dress is pretty,"" remarked Maud.",f
31408,"""Oh, we have both worn those pale blue dresses till people must know them.""",f
31409,"""There is no time to get a new dress, I'm afraid.""",f
31410,"""I shan't waste a penny of my money on dress and mother says she can't afford it.""",f
31411,"""Then your white muslin, Jeanie dear.""",f

31418,"""A gentleman to see you, Miss Hamilton.""",f
31419,Their Aunt Honoria and their mother had gone out to pay calls; they were alone.,f
31420,Jeanie flushed.,f
31421,"""A gentleman to see her"" made her heart beat, but the gentleman that entered was quite unknown.",f
31422,He bowed very politely and looked at the sisters critically.,f
31423,"""Excuse me, ladies, but five minutes will suffice.""",f
31424,Five minutes!,f
31425,The sisters looked at each other in dismay.,f
31426,Had Miles let in a lunatic?,f
31427,The stranger looked at a letter he held in his hand.,f
31428,"""Surely I am not mistaken.",f
31429,Two Miss Hamiltons at Waycott Hall.,f
31430,The order to be executed immediately.,f

31438,"Perhaps she sent the measures and the gentleman wanted to make sure,"" said Maud.",f
31439,"A faint idea had entered her head, but she would not for the world have told Jeanie.",f
31440,"""Yes, you are right--I must say it's nice of her.",f

31442,When Aunt Honoria came in she found Maud waiting for her.,f
31443,"""Did you--order a dress to be sent to us, Aunt Honoria?""",f
31444,"""A dress?",f
31445,"No, dear.",f

31536,She piloted him out of the station and both stood by the side of the dog-cart.,f
31537,Frank Weston looked round hopelessly.,f
31538,"He could not drive, and looking down at the slight girlish figure he doubted if she could, when he saw Jim holding the thorough-bred.",f
31539,Toney answered his look.,f
31540,"""Oh, yes, I'll drive you.",f
31541,There's a dry place for your violin.,f
31542,You can trust me.,f
31543,This is my own horse and we understand each other.,f
31544,It's awfully good of you to come to us.,f
31545,"You don't usually, do you, but I did so particularly want you.""",f
31546,Frank Weston gradually took in the situation.,f
31547,"""My agent said a Miss Whitburn--wanted----""  Toney jumped in and he had to follow.",f
31548,"""Yes, that's all right, that's me.",f
31549,"When your agent said, 'It will only be a big price that will tempt him,' I said, 'Go ahead!'""  Toney spoke so simply that Mr. Weston smiled.",f
31550,"""I may as well own it at once,"" he said.",f
31551,"""It was the money that tempted me.",f
31552,There is a poor friend of mine whose career is cut short in a terrible manner.,f
31553,He has creeping paralysis coming on from over-work.,f
31554,"He's too young for the charitable societies to come to his help, so----""  ""So you are going to do it!",f
31555,"Oh, isn't that lovely!",f
31556,"I am glad you told me, I'll just double the fee if that will set him up.""",f
31557,Frank stared at this unusually generous girl.,f
31558,"""Oh, but you are already paying a very heavy fee for--a very short time.",f
31559,"I expect you are one of the amateurs who have all the fine feelings of the professional--finer often, because unconnected with public recognition.""",f
31560,"He lifted his head and smiled, then became conscious that Miss Whitburn was flying along the country roads at a furious pace.",f
31561,"""Oh, gracious stars! don't think so for a moment about me!",f
31562,"I don't know one note from another, but I've got a friend who feels all that, at least I suppose so.",f
31563,"I do want you to be--sort of friendly with her, because I've got it all up for her.""",f
31564,"""All for your friend?",f
31565,"How extraordinary!"" said the genius, ""but, forgive me for asking, is your horse running away?",f
31566,"I'm no good with horses.""",f
31567,There was a touch of anxiety in his voice.,f
31568,He heard a rippling laugh near him.,f
31569,"""Don't you like it?",f
31570,"I'll pull him in, but it's the pace I like!",f
31571,"Suppose, Mr. Weston, you were driving with your--say your intended, would you be afraid for her?""",f
31572,Mr. Weston turned towards Toney with a look of dismayed surprise.,f
31573,"""I--have not--got one--I really can't say.""",f
31574,"""I'm awfully glad, I half feared you might be engaged, you know---- People say you are tremendously run after.",f
31575,"If you had been, of course I should have asked _her_ too.",f
31576,"You don't mind my saying this, do you?",f
31577,"I'm only an Australian girl, and out there we don't mince matters so much as people do here, and I once heard that--that you were going to marry a girl and that she----""  Toney cleared her throat.",f
31578,She glanced at the genius whose marble-cut face was lifted towards the sky with a hard strange look on it.,f
31579,"No one had ever dared to speak to him about that episode since it happened, and here was a strange girl introducing the subject!",f
31580,The very boldness of it put him off his guard.,f
31581,"""You heard rightly, Miss Whitburn; the only woman I ever loved jilted me, because I was not as nobly born as she was, and now----""  ""I expect she's just mad with herself that she was so silly!",f
31582,"A hundred to one it was her mother, sort of old pussy cat I shouldn't wonder.",f
31583,Why didn't you ask her again?,f
31584,I should if I were a man!,f
31585,"I would not take no, not for Joe!""",f
31586,"Toney was so excited that she flicked Colon with her whip and he, to show his surprise, suddenly reared and then bolted forward.",f
31587,The genius turned towards his terrible driver in mute appeal.,f
31588,"""It's all right, indeed it is, Colon's as gentle as a child, but I was thinking so much about your young--lady, that I touched him with the whip.",f
31589,He's awfully proud and that was his way of remonstrating.,f
31590,"Here's the gate----  Will you hold Colon a minute, or----""  ""Let me open the gate,"" said the genius, suiting the action to the words; not for the world would he have held that horse, his precious Stradivarius was behind him.",f
31591,"Toney smiled, but indeed Colon stood quite quietly whilst she remarked,  ""I told you he's like a lamb--but you will let me help about your friend?",f
31592,"It will give me so muck pleasure, and I shan't feel this concert is wasted if you do.""",f
31593,"""If I let you pay twice over?"" said the genius, now quite under the spell of this extraordinary heiress, whose generosity was as surprising as her driving.",f
31594,"""If you and my friend don't enjoy this concert--""  ""I shall do my best for your friend after your great kindness.",f
31595,"Is it--a man?""",f
31596,"He believed it was Toney's fiance as her mind ran on that subject, and he felt in a soft mood, though he could not have told why.",f
31597,"""A man!",f
31598,I should think not!,f
31599,"Mr. Russell--he helps me with my letters--he's musical, but then he doesn't think much of me!""",f
31600,"""His taste must be bad,"" said Frank, actually making a compliment.",f
31601,"""He would have more confidence in you if you drove him back from the station.""",f
31602,Frank Weston had forgiven her and Toney realised it with joy.,f
31603,"""Ouf!",f
31604,"Here's Aldersfield House, I'm glad the drive is over.",f
31605,"Will you promise, even if you don't like my friend, to take her in to dinner and to talk music to her?",f
31606,She'll love that.,f
31607,"The other people wouldn't understand it--and you won't try it on me, will you, or on Uncle Evas?",f
31608,"He'd want to be polite, but he wouldn't know what to answer.""",f
31609,"""I think you can trust me, Miss Whitburn, not to bore the unmusical.",f
31610,"I shall do my best to please your lady friend, because all the time I shall see Arthur Mullins' face when he hears of his luck.""",f
31611,"""That's all right!",f
31612,I'm awfully relieved.,f
31613,"You'll like to go to your room now at once, won't you, and rest?",f
31614,"I'll send you up some tea, and then you won't have to answer foolish questions.""",f
31615,"""That would be most kind,"" he said gratefully.",f
31616,How very extraordinarily thoughtful this young heiress seemed to be.,f
31617,"Toney was saying to herself, ""Then they won't meet till dinner-time, and she'll just be looking so beautiful that----""  ""Gollywogs!"" she exclaimed as she jumped down and Jim came running up, ""There's visitors just come.",f
31618,"Jim, take Mr. Weston in by the garden door, and tell them to take him to his room and give him tea.""",f
31619,In this way Toney smuggled in the genius and she herself stepped into the hall to find the two Hamiltons there taking their wraps off.,f
31620,"""I am glad you are come early for tea.",f
31621,I'm sure Aunt Dove will want some help about the Peerage.,f
31622,I'm no use at all.,f
31623,"If a man has got all his legs and arms, and he has a nice face and lots of genius, I don't care how he came into the world.""",f
31624,"Maud laughed, and as Jeanie walked towards the drawing-room Toney seized her.",f
31625,"""Maud, he's come, he's in his room, they won't meet till dinner.""",f
31626,"""Oh, Toney!"" gasped Maud, ""but do you know anything about some lovely dresses that came for us this morning?""",f
31627,Toney laughed.,f
31628,"""Don't betray me!",f
31629,"Pups used to say a general overlooks nothing to win the victory.""                                                                       A few select guests were expected at Aldersfield for an early dinner party before the concert.",f
31630,Lady Dove was radiant.,f
31631,She was giving a grand party at which all the honour and none of the expense was going to fall on her.,f
31632,"Even Miss Grossman had come in for smiles as she read a novel whilst her ladyship's hair was arranged, and for once punctuality was rewarded, for Lady Southbourne arrived very early with many apologies, which she hoped dear Lady Dove would accept.",f
31633,"Her husband and son had gone to town on business and might be a little late, so she had come on first and they would come later in a dog-cart.",f
31634,Lady Dove was charmed.,f
31635,"""It is so kind of you, Lady Southbourne, to come at all this foggy evening.",f
31636,I am always ready early in case a guest does come.,f
31637,"My husband and Antonia are usually late, but of course to-day there has been a good deal to arrange.",f
31638,"We have turned the barn into a concert-room, and it is really very pretty.",f
31639,I wanted all our friends of North Downshire to come.,f
31640,"The country has been a little dull lately.""",f
31641,"""Miss Whitburn has told me your party would be a great success.",f
31642,"The star's name is a secret, I hear.""",f
31643,"""Yes, one of Antonia's little secrets!",f
31644,"Of course I never interfere with her plans now she is of age, but I must say I feel rewarded when I look back on the training of the wild colt she was when we first took her, little dreaming of the result.""",f
31645,"""It must be an immense pleasure for you--though a girl with money is a responsibility, isn't she?""",f
31646,"""Ah! no one knows how many anxious thoughts I have had on that subject.""",f
31647,"""And that was what I really wanted to ask you about, dear Lady Dove.",f
31648,"I want your--help and sympathy.""",f
31649,For the great Lady Southbourne to be asking her help and sympathy made Lady Dove happy.,f
31650,"""You can always rely on my help, indeed you can!",f
31651,"Mutual help is our greatest duty.""",f
31652,"""I need not say that if you have a niece, I have a son to have anxious thoughts about--and I want you to know a little secret.""",f
31653,"""Indeed!""",f
31654,"""Yes, but I don't doubt Miss Whitburn has already confided in you.",f
31655,"Edward has proposed to her, but----""  ""Oh, what an honour for Antonia, but, indeed, Lady Southbourne, yours is a family any girl might be proud to enter!",f
31656,"Of course much above her in rank.""",f
31657,"""Edward has no foolish ideas about birth, almost a Republican on that subject, but--I see that you do not know Miss Whitburn refused him and Edward is heart-broken.""",f
31658,"""Antonia refused the----"" Lady Dove gasped.",f
31659,"""She is young, she was startled, but with your help and advice she might--reconsider it.",f
31660,"Edward is more bent on it than ever.""",f
31661,If Lady Southbourne had been sitting in the palace of truth she would have said her dear boy had just lost a large sum on the turf.,f
31662,"""Trust me, Lady Southbourne, you shall have my influence, and Antonia owes us so much.",f
31663,"I hardly think she will reject so much happiness.""",f
31664,"""Thank you a thousand times.""",f
31665,"At this moment other guests began to arrive, but where was Antonia and the great man, and where were the Hamiltons?",f
31666,Happily Sir Evas was working hard and making everybody welcome regardless of their place in the peerage.,f
31667,"Edward Lang and his father came in time, belying the fears of Lady Southbourne, and Lady Carew and her correct husband followed.",f
31668,"An Honourable or two, and a Colonel and his wife, made up the party of people worthy of meeting each other.",f
31669,"Toney had only begged for the Hamiltons, Mr. Hales and Lewis Waycott, but this latter Lady Dove had refused as ""that tiresome Miss Waycott would have to be included.""",f
31670,"For the concert everybody was coming, and a supper was to end this grand party.",f
31671,But Toney was too much occupied to give a thought to the county magnates.,f
31672,"Rose, who came to help her to put on her white dress, was not allowed to stay long.",f
31673,"""I'm all right, Rose;",f
31674,I want you to go to the Miss Hamiltons' room and beg them to come here before going down.,f
31675,"I've got them some lovely flowers.""",f
31676,"""There's some come for you too, Miss Toney,"" said Rose, holding out a lovely bunch of white lilies.",f
31677,"""It was left at the back door, and was specially to be given to you.""",f
31678,"""Oh!"" exclaimed Toney.",f
31679,"""How lovely;",f
31680,I wonder who sent them.,f

31682,"""Cook said as how you ought to have one, Miss Toney; specially you being so rich now.""",f
31683,Toney paused as she held the flowers lovingly; she always had reverenced flowers.,f
31684,"Oh, dear! even the servants associated money with love.",f
31685,It was dreadful!,f
31686,"Then she resolutely thrust away thoughts of self, and looked at her two bunches of roses.",f
31687,"Then, pinning in her lilies, she waited a little anxiously.",f
31688,Time was flying.,f
31689,"She had arranged with the footman to call Mr. Weston at the last moment, and she must get the Hamiltons down before he came.",f
31690,"There was a knock at the door, and Jeanie Hamilton stood in the doorway, a vision of beauty in a soft cloud of pale blue silk and chiffon, whilst Maud looked nearly as much transformed in rose.",f
31691,"""Oh!"" exclaimed Toney, ""how just awfully beautiful you look, Jeanie!",f
31692,May I say it? and here are some flowers I got uncle to steal for you!,f
31693,"Let me pin them on.""",f
31694,"Jeanie could not help admiring herself, and her spirits rose.",f
31695,Never had she had such a dress.,f
31696,"""Wasn't it generous of Aunt Honoria?",f
31697,"It's the most beautiful dress I have ever seen; and, look at Maud, isn't hers pretty too?",f
31698,"They must have cost a small fortune.""",f
31699,"""You both look perfect.""",f
31700,"""We must tell you about the gentleman who took our measure,"" exclaimed Maud, trying to hide her nervousness by talking.",f
31701,"""But, oh, Toney, look at the time; we ought to go down.""",f
31702,"""Yes.",f
31703,"We'll all go together, and if you go in first Aunt Dove's big-wigs will be so struck of a heap with you that they'll forget me.",f
31704,"They do seem so very extra civil to me now, all because I've got so much tin.",f
31705,"Oh! they don't know the trouble of it; but in any case I don't stick bank-notes on my clothes, so I can't see why I'm more interesting than I was before.",f
31706,"Come, let's run!",f
31707,"No, you can't with those clo'.""",f
31708,"But all the same, the three girls did run, seeing an anxious look on the butler's face as they entered the hall.",f
31709,"The door was thrown open for them, and, as Toney had predicted, the two Hamiltons made a sensation, especially Jeanie, whose face was so full of pathos, and who looked especially beautiful.",f
31710,"Toney crept in behind them, but was seen by her aunt.",f
31711,"""Toney, how dreadfully late you are!",f
31712,The musician--what's his name--has not come down yet.,f
31713,"Tell Thomas to fetch him at once.""",f
31714,Toney nodded.,f
31715,"""It's all right, Aunt Dove;",f
31716,I've done it.,f
31717,"You know musical people are not like others.""",f
31718,"Sir Evas knew he had to obey orders, and got hold of Jeanie.",f
31719,"He held the list of the other pairs in his hand, but several gentlemen came up to talk to this vision of beauty.",f
31720,"Maud kept close to Toney; she could not talk, she could hardly see.",f
31721,What would Jeanie do? and what would he do?,f
31722,Why had Toney done this?,f
31723,"How terrible; suppose there was a scene; suppose----  The door flew open and Mr. Frank Weston was announced, but Jeanie was at the other end of the room and did not hear the name.",f
31724,Toney flew up to the genius and introduced him right and left till dinner was announced; then she paused.,f
31725,"""You remember about--my friend, Mr. Weston?""",f
31726,The genius had bowed right and left in rather a formal manner.,f
31727,He was so often introduced that he barely listened to the names of the people introduced.,f
31728,He was thinking of Miss Whitburn.,f
31729,"The big-wigs were pairing off, and solemnly marched away like a regiment of newly-trained recruits, when Sir Evas suddenly introduced him to a lady whose name he did not hear.",f
31730,"He held out his arm mechanically; ladies were nothing to him, and he only saw a beautiful dress.",f
31731,"A symphony was floating through his brain, he was only acting in a dream, till suddenly he felt the arm he held tremble.",f
31732,He was recalled to earth.,f
31733,"They were crossing the hall, and the noise of voices was great Various scraps of conversation about hunting and the weather reached him, and his own name--the great Frank Weston; what a surprise, no one expected him!",f
31734,He looked down and exclaimed--he knew not what.,f
31735,"""Let me go away,"" she murmured, ""you----""  ""Impossible!",f
31736,"Miss Hamilton, pray remember we are both guests--no one knows.",f
31737,"If my presence is so--distasteful to you----""  ""I did not know.""",f
31738,"""Neither did I--but this chance meeting might have happened anywhere.""",f
31739,"""Yes----""  Jeanie straightened herself, and they both walked on in silence.",f
31740,"They were shown their places, and Frank Weston glanced at the name on his other side;",f
31741,Mrs. Arbuthnot.,f
31742,Jeanie had Colonel Arbuthnot on her other side.,f
31743,They need not speak to each other.,f
31744,How terrible!,f
31745,"Jeanie searched for Maud, but she was on the same side and could not be seen.",f
31746,Her heart beat so fast she could hardly speak.,f
31747,"She looked for Toney, someone to appeal to.",f
31748,Was she near Frank?,f
31749,"Yes, Frank was here, sitting beside her; but of course he hated her.",f
31750,"Of course, he was wishing himself miles away; of course, he would _never_ forgive her, never, never love her again.",f
31751,"Never--never, she repeated to herself.",f
31752,"Toney's eyes, which saw so much, were looking at them; she could see they were silent, and she noticed they each turned to their other neighbours.",f
31753,"Oh! her plan was failing, had failed, and she had risked everything on this dinner.",f
31754,"Maud was looking deadly pale, but in spite of all this the talk was loud, drowning nearly everything.",f
31755,Mr. Hales at her side broke the spell.,f
31756,"""You are very preoccupied this evening, and yet you have secured the one man everyone wants to hear,"" he said.",f
31757,"""Are you not satisfied?""",f
31758,"His voice had a new tone in it, which made Toney look up wonderingly.",f
31759,"""Oh, yes, I am preoccupied; so would you be if you had conspired tremendously and your conspiracy was no good.""",f
31760,"""Indeed!""",f
31761,"""Mr. Hales, help me!",f
31762,"Mr. Frank Weston isn't talking one scrap to Jeanie Hamilton.""",f
31763,"""He has come to play the violin, and I daresay he is not a good conversationalist.""",f
31764,"""It's not that, you don't know her story; he was in love with Jeanie once, and she loved him really, but she sent him away because his father had a shop and sold something, and now she's just frightfully sorry she did it, and--but he doesn't look as if he was forgiving her.",f
31765,"What would you do?""",f
31766,Mr. Hales smiled.,f
31767,"""I should never have hazarded the meeting--never.""",f
31768,"""Was I wrong?",f
31769,"Oh, but of course she _is_ sorry, and--but I wish they would notice each other.",f
31770,"If I were her I should just say I knew I was a born fool when I said no.""",f
31771,Mr. Hales laughed.,f
31772,"""I don't think _you_ would ever have said no for that reason!""",f
31773,"""I couldn't, because my father sort of kept a shop; we were always selling drugs.",f
31774,"Oh look, Mr. Hales, just out of the corner of your eye, I see Jeanie looking up into his face, and she has just refused oyster patties.""",f
31775,"""But do I understand you did all this to--bring them together?""",f
31776,"""Yes.",f
31777,"I did so want them to be happy, besides it would make Maud and Mr. Waycott happy.""",f
31778,Mr. Hales was silent.,f
31779,He was considering whether Toney would ever consent herself to say yes to somebody.,f
31780,"A dream of a larger sphere of work floated before his mental vision, a dream of a young wife who would devote her money to their work, for in every mission-field money was needed, money and workers.",f
31781,"But love seemed very far removed from Toney's ideas at this moment, and so he was silent.",f
31782,Then he asked after the work at the Haven.,f
31783,"""Miss Phipps is doing wonders, and some of my first friends come to-morrow.",f
31784,Two of the _avant garde_ and the deaf man.,f

31787,"""Yes, but I do wish we lived in the days of St.",f

31791,"""And by their prayers, Toney, I think.""",f
31792,"""Yes,"" answered Toney, ""I suppose that's where we fail; but oh, Mr. Hales, I did pray ever so hard about Jeanie and the genius!",f

31798,"""Perhaps it will, though that is a mystery to me.",f
31799,"Mr. Hales, you will keep near me, won't you, as I see the Honourable Edward looking at me sideways.",f
31800,"I'm so afraid he'll want to talk to me privately.""",f
31801,"""But perhaps----""  ""Oh no!",f
31802,I couldn't possibly think of it!,f
31803,"Besides, I'm afraid it's true what Aunt Dove said.",f
31804,"He wants the--money, and you see it would be a dreadful disappointment to hear that it--was not to be had.",f
31805,"I thought money might make two people happy, and here are the ices and they haven't yet melted!""",f
31806,"Everyone soon rose to proceed to the barn, and in that interval Toney flew to find the genius.

31817,Quite a poor man was he?,f
31818,Genius plays strange freaks.,f
31819,They say he can make as much money as he likes--Lady Gwen Steward was dying to marry him they say--but he wouldn't look at her.,f

32760,"Then followed a rare musical treat, till Toney, saying she was very sleepy, excused herself and went to bed.",f
32761,"She paced her small room like a lion in a cage; she felt she must rush up to town to-morrow and call at the hotel, so as just to see him once more, but then she argued this would be wrong knowing what she did know!",f

32768,"She opened her ""Little Flowers of St.",f

32771,Replied St.,f

32773,"And quoth he, 'Father, are ye not men even as I?",f
32774,"Wherefore, as ye endure, even so shall I be able with the grace of Jesus Christ.'""  And Toney seemed to be comforted by these words, ""As ye endure.""",f
32775,"That was it, to endure nobly, that meant she must not be beaten by her pain.",f
32776,"Ah, she too would endure as did that young noble.",f
32777,"Of course, endurance was easy when everything went right, but the only thing worth a rag was to endure when everything went wrong!",f
32778,"And Toney looked this great sorrow in the face and made up her mind, oh, if it were possible--and it was possible--to endure _cheerfully_.",f
32779,"Then, knowing she must be up early, she went to bed and fell asleep.",f
32780,"She awoke to the sound of marriage bells through the open windows; for one moment her face was all joy, then suddenly the pain returned.",f
32781,"She dressed very quickly in a plain white serge dress, and then ran out to find the motor.",f
32782,Jim was ready with it.,f

32788,"Toney laughed, Jim did not feel as did Frank Weston evidently.",f
32789,"At the church there were busy helpers, and several men from London.",f
32790,Large hampers of lilies were being unpacked.,f
32791,"Next, Toney motored to Waycott Hall and interviewed Maud, and then went home to early breakfast.",f
32792,Jim and the motor were to be kept busy.,f
32793,The actual wedding was simple in the extreme.,f
32794,"Only the Waycott Hall party, Miss Waycott, Mrs. Hamilton and Maud; and from Aldersfield, Sir Evas, Toney, the bridegroom, and Dr. Mayo.",f
32795,"As the party entered he was already playing divine music, but the church was full of poor people and of white lilies.",f
32796,Never had the little old building looked so beautiful;,f
32797,Jeanie paused at the entrance.,f
32798,"""Oh!",f
32799,"This is the most beautiful sight I have ever seen!"" she whispered to Frank.",f
32800,Mrs. Hamilton looked at Toney and then at her sister.,f
32801,"""Honoria, what extravagance, but how beautiful!""",f
32802,"""It's Toney all over,"" said Miss Honoria.",f
32803,"As to Frank Weston, he thought, ""This is as it should be, no fuss, only poor people and flowers and heavenly music.""",f
32804,"There were no jovial young men fussing and talking, no hustling, no disgraceful pushing, no whispered conversations.",f
32805,"To the poor it was nearly as good as a funeral as they listened to Mr. Hales' strong manly voice, and saw his face full of mystic joy.",f
32806,If Jeanie Hamilton had wanted any more reforming she had it then.,f
32807,How could pride exist in this sanctuary of beauty?,f
32808,"She looked like a lily herself in a white afternoon dress, not a ball dress to be minutely described in the newspapers, Jeanie, belonging to one of the oldest families in the county, was marrying a self-made man, but as she looked up at his strong face, full of manly joy, she knew that she, not he, had the best of the bargain!",f
32809,She was only proud now of belonging to him.,f
32810,Mrs. Hamilton was touched by the beauty and the originality.,f
32811,"There was no vulgarity to hurt her pride, and she forgave Maud's first words in the vestry,  ""Oh dearest Jeanie, you are a lucky woman.",f
32812,"Toney, it was quite, quite perfect.""",f
32813,"""You shall have the same, Maud, when you marry,"" answered Toney smiling.",f
32814,Maud laughed and looked guilty.,f
32815,"How pretty she appeared in her white dress, looking not unlike a bride herself.",f
32816,"The poor people remained seated till the pair came out together, but Toney stayed behind with a little army of helpers.",f
32817,"All the lilies were to be tied in bunches, and each poor person in the church was to take home a bunch.",f
32818,"Toney therefore missed seeing an uninvited guest at the church door, who shook hands cordially with the wedding party.",f
32819,"""Forgive me, Mrs. Weston, I was not invited, but I heard a whisper of your original wedding and----""  Jeanie smiled.",f
32820,"""It's Miss Whitburn's idea.",f
32821,"Could anything be more beautiful?""",f
32822,"He was by Maud's side now and he said quite gravely,  ""I took note of everything, Miss Hamilton.""",f
32823,"""Oh,"" said Maud smiling, ""it would not do for _your_ tastes.",f
32824,"Hanover Square and a rowdy audience!""",f
32825,"""Indeed you are unjust.",f
32826,"This is the first wedding I have enjoyed----""  Mrs. Hamilton was smiling, but, thinking Edward Lang wanted to make up to Toney, she did not invite him to the breakfast.",f
32827,"Only Maud lingered a minute to say something, and then the poor people came trooping out, and when Toney reappeared she was too busy talking to them to see anything else.",f
32828,"The breakfast at Waycott Hall was a great trial to Toney, but she fought against this lion and no one found out she was in a battle.",f
32829,"Dr. Mayo acted as best man, and his speech was short but to the point.",f

32831,"The bride I have only seen to-day, but I congratulate her from the bottom of my heart.",f
32832,"To be the wife of Frank Weston means to be the wife of a genius--that is nothing, he was born a genius, he couldn't help himself--but it also means to be the wife of a man who, having a grand profession, has always ennobled it, and who has never, by thought, word, or deed, lowered the high standard he set before himself, and I think Mr. and Mrs. Weston are wise to go at once to Germany, so as to avoid such demonstration from the musical world here as might be overpowering.""",f
32833,The bridegroom's speech was also very short.,f
32834,"""I thank my friend for his words, because I think he believes them!--but I rise to drink the health of Miss Whitburn.",f
32835,"I believe she does not like titles, so when we think of all she has accomplished, we mentally say 'Toney'----  Round this word centres the gratitude of two persons who can never forget her.",f
32836,"I am further asked by Mr. Lewis Waycott, to say how much he regrets not being amongst us, but his plans could not be altered.",f
32837,He has ordered that all the cottagers on his estate are to have a good dinner--he wishes us to accept that as his wedding present.,f
32838,"For my part he could not have offered me anything I appreciate more.""",f
32839,Toney felt her throat tighten again.,f
32840,Lewis had thought of the nicest thing possible--if only he had been there himself!,f
32841,"Maud was looking so happy, but then she, of course, knew he was happy, and knew he could not change.",f
32842,Now Miss Honoria had something to say.,f
32843,"""I am very sorry that my nephew is not here in person, but he thought of everybody before his departure, and he begged me to say that as all the wedding arrangements were due to Miss Whitburn, he had asked all his tenants to remember her when they enjoyed their dinner.""",f
32844,"Toney actually blushed, and Sir Evas, who was sitting beside her, nudged her.",f
32845,"""Come, Toney, say something.",f
32846,Don't say you're shy!,f
32847,"Nobody would believe that!""",f
32848,Toney laughed and stood up.,f
32849,"""It's all a mistake.",f
32850,"I'm just doing nothing but please myself awfully when I plan a romance, so there is no credit at all but----  Gracious stars!",f
32851,"I can't spout any more.""",f
32852,There was a burst of laughter and the wedding ended in merriment.,f
32853,"Toney's one comfort was, ""He did think of me anyhow.""",f
32854,"As they prepared to get ready for going away, she went up to Maud, his Maud.",f
32855,"""Maud, you do look sweet!",f
32856,I want to kiss you.,f
32857,"It will do me good.""",f
32858,It was so unlike Toney that Maud laughed.,f

32860,"I am so happy.""",f
32861,Jeanie's thanks were simple.,f

32863,"""How charming of you both, but I don't think there is another romance for me to undertake except Maud's.""",f
32864,"""Oh, Maud--must wait,"" said her sister.",f

32866,"Well, now we're going to see you off in grand style.""                                                                   Sir Evas and Toney travelled up to London directly after the wedding pair had left in a private carriage ordered by Toney.",f
32867,In the train the heiress was very quiet.,f
32868,"Sir Evas put it down to weariness, and no wonder after all she had accomplished this morning; so the ""Good Comrade"" respected her silence and read his paper.",f
32869,He was very understanding as Toney always expressed it.,f
32870,"At Waterloo, Sir Evas called a hansom for Toney.",f
32871,"""Toney, you'll only go to Mr. Staines.",f
32872,Eh?,f
32873,"Why not come on to Charing Cross Hotel later, and have tea or something?""",f
32874,Toney turned away to find her umbrella.,f
32875,The temptation was very great.,f
32876,"""I shan't have much time, uncle, and I'll get back by the first train possible;",f
32877,Aunt Dove will feel dull and will want to hear all about the wedding.,f

32879,"""You see, musicians are--well, I mean marrying out of your set wasn't the fashion in her day.""",f
32880,"""I wish I knew a nice sweep!"" said Toney laughing, ""but I don't; or I might, perhaps, fall in love with him; anyhow, I'm booked for a wallflower, so I shan't shock her!""",f
32881,"""Humph!"" said Sir Evas.",f
32882,"""Well, good-bye, I'll do your commission for you, Toney, in fact I'm going straight to Lawn and Alders now, to order a 450-bore high velocity cordite rifle for Lewis' lions.",f

32887,"Good-bye, Ducky Uncle.""",f
32888,The cab drove off and Sir Evas was left on the platform looking after it.,f
32889,"""There's something on the child's mind,"" he said to himself.",f

32892,"Chuckling at his own deep artfulness, Sir Evas went off to see about the necessary kit for killing lions and tigers!",f
32893,The clerks at Mr. Staines' office paid the heiress great attention.,f

32895,You cannot be treated in an ordinary way if you are worth that amount.,f
32896,Toney was shown into the private room at once.,f

32898,Delighted to see you!,f

32916,"""You would then make a home of your own.""",f
32917,"""Yes; but I wouldn't have a big place in a park.",f

32994,"She ordered some tea and hot toast to try and get him out of her thoughts, but she felt terribly lonely in the big place so full of people going and coming.",f
32995,It was like a miniature world full of persons thinking of their own concerns or their own comfort.,f
32996,For the first time she began to appreciate the lonely park at Aldersfield.,f
32997,It was this busy world that oppressed her now.,f
32998,Was she changing?,f
32999,"She who had jostled against so many persons, and who had been afraid of nothing.",f
33000,"She felt better after her tea and jumped into a hansom again, to return to Mr. Staines.",f
33001,How glad she would be when the deed of gift was done and signed.,f
33002,Once more she stood in the private room.,f
33003,Mr. Staines looked really distressed.,f
33004,"""You have forced me to go against my conscience,"" he said, unfolding a big paper.",f
33005,Toney could not help laughing as she sat down with alacrity to sign.,f
33006,"""I've kept a sufficiency,"" he said;",f
33007,"""don't try me too much.""",f
33008,"""You are really nice,"" she answered, signing her full name with a flourish whilst two clerks came to witness the signature and retired, little guessing what they had helped to do.",f
33009,"""I've endowed Stone House with L30,000 a year.",f
33010,That will be ample for a whole colony.,f
33011,"The money you gave to Lady Dove has taken a slice of the capital, and you have lived in fine style since then!",f
33012,"Then the building will take another large slice.""",f
33013,"""When Aunt Dove dies I want you to settle the L2,000 on Miss Maud Hamilton,"" said Toney.",f
33014,"""She is a great friend of mine and poor.",f
33015,"Oh, I've had a glorious time, Mr. Staines, but I knew it was only for a time.",f
33016,St.,f
33017,"Francis never kept things with the excuse of giving them away again.""",f
33018,"""Hang St.",f
33019,"Francis!""",f
33020,"Toney laughed, and Mr. Staines could not help smiling.",f
33021,"""Well, good-bye, I've got to catch a train, and please, Mr. Staines, will you accept a little personal present?",f
33022,"Not the firm----  Just to show you forgive me, and _I_ won't say how _you_ are to spend it!",f
33023,"Oh, it's from me and the General.""",f
33024,Then like a strange gleam of unearthly sunshine Toney was gone.,f
33025,Mr. Staines opened the envelope and discovered a cheque for a thousand pounds.,f
33026,"From another client it is doubtful if he would have accepted it, but a strange smile passed over his face.",f
33027,"""They are going to shut up a wing of the Children's Hospital at Margate,"" he said;",f
33028,"""this will just save it; that girl sets a shocking example, but I did my best----""  He was not yet happy, but, strange to say, he was somewhat comforted.",f
33029,Toney walked into the Aldersfield drawing-room half an hour before the dressing bell.,f
33030,Lady Dove was listening to Miss Grossman's rather loud voice.,f
33031,"The novel was dull, and she was glad to stop her.",f
33032,Usually Miss Grossman insisted on reading the whole hour before dinner without stopping or allowing her employer to talk.,f
33033,"""Oh, Aunt Dove, I've had a nice afternoon.",f
33034,I saw Mr. Staines and had a jolly tea at the Lyons' Restaurant.,f
33035,"Uncle is coming back early to-morrow, but I knew you'd be dying to hear about our wedding.""",f
33036,"""Mrs. Hamilton has been here and told me all.",f
33037,"I'm sure, Toney, you must have wasted a great deal on flowers out of season.""",f
33038,"""They did good all round, and Jeanie and Mr. Weston just seemed lifted up by them.",f
33039,"So would you have been if you'd seen them.""",f
33040,"""I never countenance useless waste,"" was the answer.",f
33041,"""Sentimentality is not sentiment,"" interposed Miss Grossman.",f
33042,"To herself Toney said, ""Consider the lilies of the field how they grow;"" aloud, she added, ""Anyhow Miss Honoria agreed that Jeanie and Maud looked lovely!""",f
33043,"""Mrs. Hamilton really bored me about her daughters' perfections.",f
33044,"I said I was sorry her son-in-law's escutcheon was a blank, but, of course, she is going to keep Maud in her own set.",f
33045,"Lewis Waycott has as many quarterings as the Hamiltons.""",f
33046,"Toney's heart went thump, thump, again.",f
33047,How horrid she was!,f
33048,"""Quarterings are no use at all to the Westons.",f
33049,"They will be just perfect without them,"" said Toney.",f
33050,"""But of course,"" continued Lady Dove, ""I do wonder at her countenancing the marriage of cousins.""",f
33051,"""The future owner of Waycott will be an idiot,"" said Miss Grossman decidedly.",f
33052,Then Toney rushed away; the atmosphere of the drawing-room without Uncle Evas suffocated her.,f
33053,"""If it weren't for him,"" she thought, ""I would fly to the Haven at once, but I can't forsake him, no, I can't, he's so awfully good to me.""",f
33054,"Happily everybody was tired that evening (Miss Grossman condescended to dine with them as Lady Dove was alone, for Toney's companionship did not count), and Toney did her best to rattle on about all sorts of things till the early bedtime when all three were glad to retire to bed, little guessing what the night would bring forth, but as Toney said her prayers her heart seemed suddenly to feel light again.",f
33055,"""It will be easier to get to the other side,"" she thought, ""without that load, anyway!""                                                                    Toney was usually an excellent sleeper and it took a good deal to wake her before morning, and she had gone through much in the last twenty-four hours.",f
33056,"The brain, however, can be powerfully impressed by smell, and this must have been the reason why at two o'clock she heard a soft whine close to her ear, then a short, sharp bark, and then Toney started up in bed, fully awake.",f
33057,Next she gave a sniff and then the strong clear mind went straight to the mark.,f
33058,"""Powder me pink!"" she exclaimed, then she jumped out of bed and dressed quicker than she had ever done in her life before.",f
33059,"Her garments were few and substantial, and she drew on a skirt and a flannel blouse.",f
33060,Next she seized a big bath towel and soaked it in her hip bath.,f
33061,"""It's shorter in the long run,"" she thought, then she cautiously opened the door of her small room at the top of the house.",f
33062,"The passage had smoke in it too, thicker smoke than in her room.",f
33063,For half a second she paused to think as she snatched up Trick in her arms.,f
33064,"""Maids up here--the men in the other wing--bother, the telephone is down in my room--worse luck!""",f
33065,"Then she dashed along the passage to the maids' rooms, opening each door as she passed, and shouting, ""Get up!",f
33066,Fire!,f
33067,"Quick!""",f
33068,"At the end of the passage the cook opened the door, she was dressed, having also been awakened by the smell of smoke.",f
33069,"""Oh, Miss Tonia!",f
33070,"It's fire--God have mercy on us!""",f
33071,"""All right, ring a bell out of the window, the men in the other wing will hear it.",f
33072,"Shout Fire!--and, look here, tell the maids to dress first, it's safer in the end.""",f
33073,"The elderly cook felt that Miss Tonia was right, her words acted like a strong restorative and brought back her presence of mind as the half-dressed maids crowded into the passage.",f
33074,"""Dress all of you girls, thick jackets, it's cold; we are safe at present.""",f
33075,Toney paused.,f
33076,"""Yes, all safe at present, take wet towels with you.",f
33077,"I'm afraid it's on the first floor, and these stairs don't look inviting!""",f
33078,"A volume of smoke rolled up now, and for a moment hid them from each other.",f
33079,"Toney wrapped her wet towel round her head and shoulders and once more called out,  ""Keep together--shout loud--try the other stairs, not these.",f
33080,"I'll go and explore, but you had better not.",f
33081,"Try the leads, you'll be safer there.",f
33082,"Good-bye!""",f
33083,"""Miss Tonia! for God's sake don't go down those stairs, it's madness, stay here,"" cried the cook.",f
33084,"""I can't, Aunt Dove and Miss Grossman, but look here, Rose, take Trick and hold him tight, he will want to follow me and I must have my two hands,"" then suddenly Toney disappeared in another volume of smoke.",f
33085,"The maids shrieked and wrung their hands, but the cook had happily regained her senses.",f
33086,"""Girls! follow me, the other stairs may be safe.""",f
33087,"Clinging to each other they ran down the long passage, but at the other end they found quite as much smoke, for the narrow stairs seemed to act like two funnels.",f
33088,"""Let's go down, oh, let's go down!"" cried the maids, ""we must go before it's too late!""",f
33089,"""Miss Tonia said, 'the leads'--I think, girls, she's right.",f
33090,We can call for help from there.,f
33091,We might be suffocated in this smoke.,f
33092,"Make for the trap-door on to the leads,"" and soon they were breathing pure air and exercising their lungs with screams.",f
33093,To their delight they saw that men were already running about below and were signalling to them that help was coming.,f
33094,We must follow Toney on her dangerous exploration.,f
33095,She had one idea in her mind.,f
33096,"The fire must have begun in her Aunt Dove's room or else in Miss Grossman's, a few doors off, or else in some flue close by.",f
33097,The dense smoke pointed unmistakably to this.,f
33098,Had they escaped?,f
33099,"Their rooms were at the end of a passage, and they must go down it to reach the central staircase.",f
33100,"The stairs down which she now forced her way were rather steep, and ended at the opposite end of the Hall to where was her aunt's passage, but Toney knew every step by heart.",f
33101,"It was impossible to see even if there had been any light, the smoke was too thick.",f
33102,Should she meet the fire face to face and be driven back?,f
33103,Even here she felt the stairs were hot and the smoke was terrible.,f
33104,"When she reached the bottom, however, she paused; by some strange freak for a few moments the smoke cleared, and she could breathe again!",f
33105,"Oh, the relief! but this was only for a moment.",f
33106,"She had to keep her mind clear; wrapping her wet towel still closer to her head, she made a dash along the central passage.",f
33107,"Toney realised that this was passable, but dense smoke came rolling towards her from her aunt's passage.",f
33108,"Oh, how could she pass it?",f
33109,"She must, she must go on, for no one answered her smothered cry of ""Aunt Dove!",f
33110,Aunt Dove!,f
33111,"Miss Grossman!""",f
33112,Again she paused to take what breath she could.,f
33113,"Her eyes tingled, she felt choked, but as yet she saw no fire.",f
33114,"""I must, I must,"" she repeated and strangely enough came the words to her mind, ""the Path of Perfection.""",f
33115,Was this the Path?,f
33116,If only Aunt Dove were not locked in!,f
33117,"If only Uncle Evas had been here! if only-- ""Now,"" she thought, feeling the towel was getting dry and smoke-laden, ""Now!""",f
33118,Never had Toney made such a desperate dart down the passage.,f
33119,"Oh, the heat! and the roaring and the smoke!--the smoke, that was the most terrible part of it!",f
33120,"She hurled herself, blindfolded as she was, against the door and it gave way, but how the smoke rolled in with her!",f
33121,"So immediately she shut the door, then she loosed the towel and called out.",f
33122,"""Aunt Dove, Aunt Dove! where are you?",f
33123,"Speak, I can't see, Aunt Dove!""",f
33124,"""Help! help!"" was the feeble smothered answer, but it was Miss Grossman's voice.",f
33125,"""Where? where?""",f
33126,She stumbled forwards across the big room and knocked against the bath filled with water.,f
33127,"She stooped down and dashed her head in it, towel and all.",f
33128,What a relief she felt as she staggered forwards.,f
33129,"""Miss Grossman, where is Aunt Dove?",f
33130,"Where are you?""",f
33131,"""In the wardrobe--we are suffocated!",f
33132,"Help! help!""",f
33133,"""Come out quick.""",f
33134,Toney seized another towel and dipped it in the bath.,f
33135,"""We can still cross--at least I think so.""",f
33136,"The big wardrobe opened, and as Miss Grossman crawled out Toney threw the wet towel over her; then Lady Dove emerged speechless from fear and smoke.",f
33137,"""Miss Grossman, why didn't you go down?",f
33138,"I, think we can still do it.""",f
33139,"""I ran in here, and then--Lady Dove would not follow me.",f
33140,"Oh, the smoke--the window--open the window!""",f
33141,"""No, no, not yet, the draught--quick, oh, quick--Aunt Dove, take my arm.",f
33142,"You have only your dressing-gown--take a blanket--Miss Grossman, run fast, we will follow.""",f
33143,"Miss Grossman was feeling the relief of the wet towel, she made a dash towards the door.",f
33144,"""Quick!",f
33145,"Aunt Dove, follow me--I'll drag you, we have only just time.""",f
33146,"""I can't, Antonia--don't leave me--oh, I can't breathe!""",f
33147,"""You must, you must.""",f
33148,"Toney dragged her a few steps, but fear had paralyzed her; at this moment Miss Grossman had reached the door and realised the danger of opening it more than once.",f
33149,A dull roar was heard.,f
33150,"""Are you coming?",f
33151,"For God's sake, I cannot go alone----""  ""Go,"" cried Toney, ""you have time--I think.",f
33152,"Aunt Dove, come, for Uncle Evas' sake come--pull yourself together.",f
33153,"In a minute we----""  The door was opened by Miss Grossman, whose muffled voice again called out, ""Come, come,"" then she shut it again, and Toney was left alone with her aunt.",f
33154,"A terrible column of smoke had rolled in, and she noticed that one tongue of fire tried to pierce the smoke in the big chamber.",f
33155,"""Toney, I can't--I can't walk.",f
33156,"Don't leave me--air--air--open the window!""",f
33157,"""Yes, it's too late for the door, Aunt Dove, we must come back--I'll open the window and call.",f
33158,"Oh! they must be trying to save us now--don't leave go--stick tight to me: they will hear us.""",f
33159,Toney felt a terrible weight on her; would her aunt give in?,f
33160,"Here was one of the windows, the red curtain drawn across it, she pulled it back, a sofa was against it, she managed with superhuman effort to get her aunt on it, but it was terribly difficult.",f
33161,"""Aunt Dove, I'll open now or we shall be suffocated--only--there is danger--the draught--you know!",f
33162,I'll not leave you.,f
33163,"Hold my jacket whilst I open.""",f
33164,"The window was locked, she could not find the bolt with that weight impeding her, she wrapped her hand round the towel and smashed the glass.",f
33165,"Oh, the relief of the air! all danger seemed for a moment swallowed up in that relief.",f
33166,She was even able to unbolt the latch and pull up the sash.,f
33167,"""Help! help!",f
33168,"Jim, ladders--help!""",f
33169,"She saw a crowd below, some holding lanterns, some torches.",f
33170,"She heard a fire engine gallop up, she even saw a shoot.",f
33171,"""Here! here!"" she called.",f
33172,Were they saved?,f
33173,"""Aunt Dove, they are coming.",f
33174,"Put your head out of the window!""",f
33175,Toney said this because the roar behind them was increasing.,f
33176,She saw the tongue of fire very plainly now.,f
33177,Was there time?,f
33178,The engine was there.,f
33179,"A great jet of water was playing on them, no, above them, they had not yet located the fire and it was coming, coming.",f
33180,"Oh! the heat, the terrible heat! but now the fire escape was there, it was placed against the wall.",f

33183,"I can't move, Toney! the fire--look!""",f
33184,"""No, no, don't look.""",f
33185,"A ringing cheer, and a man was on the sill, having run up a ladder whilst the shoot was placed in position close to the window.",f
33186,"""Quick,"" he said, ""not a moment to waste--one at a time.""",f
33187,"Toney did not hesitate, never thought of hesitating, as she dragged her aunt up to the sill.",f

33200,She jumped on the sill and stood for a few seconds clinging to the sash above.,f
33201,"Then she saw there was but one chance for her; she must let herself drop on to a kind of parapet below, and then clutch the iron rod that was now at her feet--if she did not miss it!",f
33202,"In the lurid light she was seen by everybody--there was a breathless moment, then she let go--and without once hesitating clutched and retained the rod.",f
33203,"A roar of admiration and horror mingled together was heard; then suddenly, like a lightning flash, another form had run up the ladder, and though it was not in right position Jim stretched out both arms and supported her, in what was an untenable position--because--Toney's sleeve had caught fire.",f
33204,"""Miss Tonia, hold on one minute.",f
33205,"Now""--with one hand he held her, with the other he crushed the fire out, then--but for Jim there would have been no then, Toney could not have held on--the next instant the shoot was moved and again placed in position for Toney, and Jim straining forward helped her to get in--alone she could not have done it.",f
33206,"""Miss Tonia, Miss Tonia--thank God, it's all right.""",f
33207,"Then Toney heard a great shout, a shout that permeated everywhere, and she felt herself sliding down, down, always down; but the truth was that for the first time in her life Toney had fainted, and when she came to herself she was in the big barn where the grand supper had been served, and which was situated on the side where the fire was not.",f

33295,"But Lewis did not reply, he was hurrying into his clothes with greater rapidity than ever before, and when Sir Evas stepped into the carriage he did not see that Lewis Waycott jumped in too, just as the train was starting.

33306,"You must go to bed.""",f
33307,"""We are all proud of you,"" said Mrs. Hamilton, conquered at last, for personal courage was her special admiration, ""Miss Grossman told us all.",f
33308,"Lady Dove has gone to bed and begged not to be disturbed, so you had better not see her yet, she is much shaken.""",f
33309,"""How did you get through?"" said Toney to the companion.",f
33310,"""Aunt Dove couldn't move, I think fear paralyzed her, and, gracious stars! the shoot just finished her for a moment.",f
33311,"We had to use force, I couldn't go down on her head, and by the time I could I had to move away from it along the sill, out of reach.",f
33312,"But you know, Miss Honoria, Jim saved me.",f
33313,"I was holding on for all I was worth, but--oh, I couldn't have done it half a minute longer.""",f
33314,"Toney was simply bent on praising Jim, forgetting that these horrible moments had been endured for Aunt Dove's sake.",f
33315,"""I couldn't have got through but for that soaked towel, Miss Whitburn, you saved my life, I shall feel in your debt for the rest of my life,"" said Miss Grossman, who having washed and dressed looked quite normal.",f
33316,Toney laughed.,f

33318,"""I find, to my surprise, that the obvious escapes one at such moments.",f
33319,"Lady Dove rang the bell in my room violently and, smelling smoke, I ran to her without thought.",f

33321,"""Well, that was real lucky for her, but I guess you were nearly stifled in that wardrobe,"" said Toney smiling.",f
33322,"""Tell me what Aunt Dove said afterwards?""",f
33323,"""If you wish to know, she said it was the first time you had been of real use.""",f

33331,"Toney washed her face and brushed her hair in Maud's room, then she hurried towards the study.",f

33339,How horrid of Maud!,f
33340,What would Lewis think?,f

33343,"She must have imagined, all--the other thing?",f
33344,"A great weight seemed to be suddenly lifted from her heart, she felt light as air so that she actually burst out laughing.",f

33349,"The lovers stared hard, then Maud actually cried and ended by laughing.",f

33352,"""Aunt Dove's got an awfully good constitution, so there's no hurry,"" said Toney, ""but I'm so very, very glad, Mr. Lang, though of course, Maud is too good for you, only----""  They all laughed, and Maud seeing Toney's tired look, suggested she should lie down and be left alone.",f
33353,"""Yes, I think I'll curl up,"" said Toney, ""I'm still a bit dazed--but, oh, Maud--I never guessed!""",f
33354,"The lovers went out and Toney called Trick, then literally curled herself round on the big sofa, feeling that it would take a long time to re-adjust her ideas.",f
33355,"Why had she believed Aunt Dove, and--oh, it was all a mistake--what about Lewis' strange coldness?",f
33356,"But even the new sweet, strange puzzle, and the great lightness of heart, could not keep her weary eyes open, though she did not want to sleep but to see Sir Evas directly he appeared, so she took her little book out of her pocket and opened it at the place where the little boy saw St.",f
33357,"Francis in a wood, surrounded with heavenly visitors, and she read how St.",f
33358,"Francis, returning home, stumbled over the boy, and then lifted him in his arms, ""as doth a good shepherd with his sheep,"" and Toney thought of the terrible moments on the sill, and thanked God that she had been upheld by the Good Shepherd till help had come, for she heard Jim tell someone that it was a miracle how Miss Tonia had held on----  Then ""The Little Flowers of St.",f
33359,"Francis"" dropped from her hands and Toney fell asleep.                          Sir Evas, getting out at Winchley Station, stumbled against Lewis Waycott.",f

33373,"""Yesterday!",f
33374,"Was she in town?""",f
33375,"""Yes, I forgot to say so--Staines said she insisted on making an immediate deed of gift to that confoun--well, that Stone House of hers of L30,000, and to think of all the time I wasted on that girl's money affairs!",f
33376,It's preposterous!,f

33378,"""A deed of gift of L30,000!"" repeated Lewis turning towards Sir Evas with a flash of joy in his eyes.",f
33379,"""Yes, I thought you'd be as surprised as I am.",f
33380,"Worse--Staines said he would tell me--out of the remainder, she's given my wife L2,000 principal and interest, and at her death it's to go on to your Cousin Maud.""",f
33381,"""To Maud!""",f
33382,"""Yes, Toney's very fond of Maud, and--you know I expect she thought it would help you.""",f
33383,"""Help me!",f
33384,"Why?""",f
33385,"""Oh she told me not to let the cat out of the bag, but I never could keep a cat in anything.",f

33387,"""Good heavens!",f
33388,"What else--she won't have much left.""",f
33389,"""Confound it all--the rest, I suppose, will build Stone House, only----"" and Sir Evas chuckled,  ""Staines has kept the coal mines as her share, and there's no knowing what they are worth, unless the seam fails--there'll be pickings, but only pickings.",f
33390,"Such a fortune, a princely fortune.",f
33391,"Stone couldn't have foreseen it.""",f
33392,"""I believe he did, Sir Evas, I believe it was his fashion of dispensing charity.""",f
33393,"""I don't know, he was a queer fish himself, gave lavishly in secret, but--it's really enough to turn Staines' hair white.""",f
33394,Here Lewis Waycott laughed aloud;,f
33395,Sir Evas looked at him a little reproachfully.,f
33396,"""I don't see the joke.""",f
33397,"""Forgive me, Sir Evas--I do--but what made Toney say that about Maud?",f
33398,What an absurd idea!,f
33399,I'm awfully fond of Maud--I think I told Toney so--but I look upon these girls as my sisters.,f
33400,"They're tremendously improved, and it's Toney's doing.""",f
33401,"""Then you're not engaged to Maud!",f

33405,The two men were surrounded immediately by responsible and irresponsible people.,f

33407,Lewis Waycott looked away.,f
33408,He was a strong man but at that moment he felt faint.,f
33409,"""They are all at Waycott, Sir Evas,"" said Lewis, ""I think I'll go on.""",f
33410,"""Yes, do, say I am coming.",f
33411,I must thank my people for saving so much of my property.,f
33412,"There isn't a picture burnt, and much of the furniture is saved.""",f
33413,"Sir Evas had become very popular since Toney had rubbed his shyness off, so now he went about among his tenants scattering kind words, and he was almost overcome by their heartfelt sympathy.",f
33414,"Though his treasures had been at everybody's mercy, not the smallest thing had been injured.--""It will soon be built up again, sir--'Twas a mercy everyone was saved--Her ladyship wouldn't face the shoot at first, sir--If Miss Tonia hadn't been there the two ladies would have been roasted alive--The ways of Providence is wonderful!",f

33424,"""That wasn't nothing, sir.",f
33425,"I was so mad that they didn't move the shoot quicker, I thought her ladyship must have stuck half-way, so I ran up a ladder, and though it wasn't quite in the right place I managed, by stretching out, to hold Miss Tonia for a minute till the shoot came.",f
33426,"If it hadn't been for that she couldn't have held on, how she did it at all, sir, is a miracle, but she's got such a cool head has Miss Tonia, 'tain't another like her anywhere, sir.""",f

33431,And Jim's ideas on this point lasted till they reached Waycott Hall gates.,f

33433,"Go back for Sir Evas.""",f
33434,Lewis sneaked into his own house like a thief.,f
33435,"His brain seemed spinning round with a multitude of ideas, as if it were on fire.",f
33436,"He mentally saw Toney on that ledge and--he muttered some savage words about himself for not being there, adding, ""Hang that Jim, he'll be unbearable for the rest of his life.""",f
33437,"No one was expecting him, the hall was deserted, he walked through it and from habit made for his own study.",f
33438,He wanted to calm himself before seeing them all; of course Toney was upstairs--perhaps in bed.,f
33439,Oh! he could wait now.,f
33440,"If he told anyone he was here, Aunt Honoria would claim him, and he should have to hear that horrid story again.",f
33441,He opened the door and stepped in.,f
33442,"He walked to the fireplace--then----  Good heavens! there was Toney on his sofa, fast asleep, and there too was Trick, who pricked up his ears and barked!",f
33443,"Toney woke up with a start, and with her right hand rubbed her eyes.",f
33444,"""Gracious stars!",f
33445,"Uncle--oh, it's----""  She sank down again because her legs refused to carry her.",f
33446,"""It's only Lewis,"" he said sitting down beside her.",f
33447,"""Toney--Toney, I've come back to tell you what a fool I've been.""",f
33448,"""You haven't yet killed all the lions in Somaliland, have you?"" said Toney trying to laugh in her old manner; but the laugh died away before the look in Lewis' eyes.",f
33449,"""Let me tell you quick, Toney.""",f
33450,"He took her hand, and Toney felt she was dreaming, for never had he looked like that before, never had he held her hand in this manner.",f
33451,"""I went away because I loved you--yes, I have always loved you, and you only, but that beastly money came in the way!",f
33452,"Lady Dove said I wanted your money, and my horrid pride couldn't swallow the gold!",f
33453,"I sacrificed everything to it; then came the day when I couldn't stand any more, I couldn't live and see you every day and say nothing when I wasn't sure--of your feelings.",f
33454,"I wasn't worthy of you, Toney;",f
33455,"I might have trusted you, I might have known that the money would never stay with you, and now I've heard; but, oh, my Toney, will you believe that I was coming before I knew;",f
33456,"I was coming to swallow the whole fortune, and the _on dits_ of the whole county, only your uncle told me, and, anyhow, I ask you now, will you be my wife, not for the money, but for yourself?",f
33457,"If you say I don't deserve you, if you say you don't care enough for me, I'll go off again and wait--and then, another thing, Toney, you thought about Maud--how could you?",f
33458,"I expect it was Lady Dove again, and now you have just saved her life, and nearly--Toney--Toney.""",f
33459,He put his strong arm round her and she did not resist.,f
33460,"""Speak to me and tell me--and then I'll face all those Society lions.""",f
33461,"Then Toney just laid her weary head on his shoulder, and there was a lump in her throat and a great, great gladness in her heart.",f
33462,"""Don't go away, ever again--I've been very, very miserable, and I hated myself because I thought you belonged to Maud----  Is it true, quite, quite true?""",f
33463,"""It's awfully true--Toney, you won't go on believing about Maud?""",f
33464,"""Oh, gracious stars! no!"" cried Toney lifting up her face that was so pink, and her eyes that were so bright;",f
33465,"""because she's just been engaging herself to the Honourable Edward Lang!""",f
33466,"""Maud?"" shouted Lewis, and they both laughed together.",f
33467,"""So you knew--when?""",f
33468,"""Oh, here, just before I went to sleep.",f
33469,"Then all the horrid feelings went away--and dear, dear Lewis, I sort of felt you would come back, and I was so happy--and you won't mind my being rather poor, though Aunt Dove says you ought to marry money; but even for you I could not keep it, because it was all dedicated long ago to the poor and needy.""",f
33470,"""My darling, I've proved I don't care, though in a stupid way---- Toney, say you forgive me for hurting you, and now--I claim the gift you promised me long ago from the cottage window.""",f
33471,"""Oh, Lewis, was it that? and I never guessed!""",f
33472,Then a great content fell on them both.,f
33473,"""I said I would give you what you asked, and I think that I always have loved you, though I never knew it till--you went away!",f
33474,"Oh! there's uncle--let me go--and tell him; he sort of guessed it before I did!""",f
33475,"""He's more sense than I have,"" said Lewis laughing.",f
33476,"Then they stood up with shining eyes waiting for Sir Evas, and Toney whispered,  ""I was so lonely, so lonely, and the work seemed so hard, and now you'll never leave me and we'll work together;",f
33477,"I see now I can't do it alone, and I do hope 'That is the way God would have us to go,' as dear St.",f
33478,"Francis said whenever he was starting on a journey!""",f
33479,"""We'll go, God helping us, all the way together, my Toney,"" said Lewis as they stood together ""and as for the lions, they may eat each other up.",f

33481,"""They've been so awfully good to me, but--I am not _quite_ sure about Aunt Dove's joy!""",f
33482,"""Hang her,"" muttered Lewis.",f
33483,"As they went out hand-in-hand together, they laughed the old happy laugh, and met Sir Evas face to face at the hall door.",f
33484,"""What the Dickens!"" he began.",f
33485,"""By Jove! is _that_ it?""",f
33486,"""Yes, you dear, ducky uncle,"" said Toney, throwing her arms round his neck and giving him a bear's hug, ""yes, _that's_ it!""",f
33487,"People said that Joe Hayward's pictures ""lacked something.""",f
33488,"Even the critics, who know everything, were at a loss to find where the deficiency might be.",f
33489,"Hayward, himself, worked hard studying the masters, patiently correcting faults in colour and perspective, and succeeding after a fashion.",f
33490,"But he felt that art, in its highest and best sense, was utterly beyond him; there was a haunting elusive something which was continually beyond his reach.",f
33491,"Occasionally, when he sold a picture, he would give ""a time"" to a dozen artist chums from studios near by, as they did, whenever fortune favoured them; after this he would paint again, on and on, with a really tremendous perseverance.",f
33492,"At length, he obtained permission to make an exhibition of his work in a single room at the Art Gallery.",f
33493,"The pictures were only ten in number, and some of them were small, but they represented a year's hard work.",f
33494,"When he superintended the hanging, on Saturday morning, he was more nearly happy than he had ever been in his life.",f
33495,"The placard on the door, ""The Hayward Exhibition will open Monday,"" filled him with pleasure.",f
33496,"It was not a conceited feeling of importance, but rather a happy consciousness that he had done his best.",f
33497,At last he was suited with the arrangement.,f
33498,"The men went out with the ladder and wire, and he stood in the centre of the room, contemplating the result.",f
33499,"The landscape in the corner might be a little out of drawing, he thought, but the general public would not notice that.",f
33500,"And the woman in white, beside it, which he had christened _Purity_ certainly showed to good advantage.",f
33501,"He remembered very well the day he had put the finishing touches upon it after the night of revelry in which he had helped Jennings and a dozen other fellows from neighbouring studios to celebrate the sale of Jennings' _Study of a Head_, and how he had thought, at the time, that he, who spent such nights, had no business to paint a figure like this of _Purity_.",f
33502,"As he turned to leave the room, he saw a grey gowned young woman, who evidently did not know that the pictures were not as yet upon public view.",f
33503,"She passed him as she came in, with a rustle of silken skirts and a cooling odour of violets.",f
33504,"Seeing the key of the room in his hand, she turned to him and said: ""Pardon me, but can you tell me whose pictures these are?""",f
33505,"""These are Hayward's,"" he replied.",f
33506,"""Hayward,"" she repeated after him, as if the name were wholly new to her.",f
33507,"""Hayward is a young artist and of purely local reputation,"" he explained.",f
33508,"""This is his first public exhibition.""",f
33509,"She surveyed the collection without any very strong show of pleasure, until he remarked, ""You don't seem to think much of his beginning.""",f
33510,"She was prompt in her answer: ""No, I do not, they seem to lack something.""",f
33511,He sighed inwardly.,f
33512,"That old, old, ""something.""",f
33513,"Hayward's pictures all lacked ""something"" as everybody said of them; but what that something was, his intimates, his fellow artists, were not the kind to know.",f
33514,"""What is it, do you think?"" he asked.",f
33515,"""I don't know,"" she replied slowly.",f
33516,"""If one knew the man, one might be able to tell.""",f
33517,For the first time she looked him full in the face.,f
33518,"He saw nothing but her eyes, clear and honest, reading him through and through.",f
33519,"""Yes,"" he answered, ""if you knew the man, I think you could tell.""",f
33520,"""I'm not at all sure,"" she laughed, ""It's only a fancy of mine.""",f
33521,"Drawing a watch from her belt, she looked surprised and turned away.",f
33522,He listened until the silken rustle had completely ceased.,f
33523,"Then he, too, went out and on the stair he found a fine handkerchief edged with lace, delicately scented with violet, and minutely marked in the corner: ""Constance Grey.""",f
33524,"On Sunday night, the studio building where Hayward and others painted glowed with light.",f
33525,"The morrow's opening of ""The Hayward Exhibition"" was being celebrated with ""a time"" at the expense of the artist.",f
33526,"Glasses clinked, and the air was heavy with smoke, two women from a vaudeville theatre, near by made merry upon an impromptu stage.",f
33527,Everybody seemed to be happy except Hayward.,f
33528,The owner of the handkerchief was in his mind.,f
33529,"He felt that those eyes of hers grey, deep, and tender, though they were, might blaze with anger at a scene like this.",f
33530,The handkerchief had no place in such an atmosphere.,f
33531,"He went over to his book case, and put it between the leaves of his Tennyson, smiling as he caught the words on the opposite page:    ""A man had given all other bliss   And all his worldly worth for this,   To waste his whole heart in one kiss       Upon her perfect lips.""",f
33532,"Her handkerchief would feel more at home there, he thought, though as he closed the book, he could not help wondering what she would say if she looked into the room.",f
33533,"A quick eye had followed his movement, and soon afterward its owner, Jennings, took occasion to examine the volume.",f
33534,He waved the handkerchief aloft triumphantly.,f
33535,"""Heigho, fellows!",f
33536,Hayward's got a new mark for his clothes!,f
33537,"Look here--'Constance Grey'!""",f
33538,"Hayward was shaken with mingled shame and anger that he could not explain, even to himself.",f
33539,The words and tone with which he commanded his friend to put the little thing back where he had found it were as hot as they were foolish.,f
33540,"For a moment the two men faced each other; then Jennings apologised, and afterward Hayward murmured a sort of apology also.",f
33541,In sparkling champagne they drank to good fellowship again.,f
33542,"But the incident was not without a certain subtle effect upon the celebration, and at one o'clock Hayward sat alone with his face buried in his hands, a dainty handkerchief spread out before him, and beside it was the rapidly sketched outline of a face which he had just completed.",f
33543,He knew now why the action of Jennings had made him so furious.,f
33544,"The shaft of light from a woman's eyes, which once strikes deep into the soul of every man, had at last come home to him.",f
33545,"The ""opening"" was auspicious.",f
33546,Wealth and art alike were well represented.,f
33547,"One of his most important pictures was marked ""sold"" before the evening was over, and everybody congratulated the artist upon his good fortune.",f
33548,"In praise of his art, however, very little was said that did not somehow carry in it, perhaps silently, the old drawback--the implication that something was lacking; still exultation ran rife in his veins.",f
33549,There were throngs of beautiful women there and he was the centre of it all.,f
33550,"Toward the end of the evening, a lady who had once sat for a portrait came up to him.",f
33551,"She was one of a little group who came in late after a theatre party, but she approached with the air of an old friend.",f
33552,"""Mr. Hayward,"" she said, ""I want you to know my niece.""",f
33553,He followed her into the next room where a young lady sat upon a divan.,f
33554,"Her grey eyes were lifted to his face, and then suddenly lowered in confusion.",f
33555,"""Mr. Hayward,"" she said, ""I am so ashamed!""",f
33556,"And when he tried to reassure her, she answered: ""Let's not talk about it--it's too humiliating!""",f
33557,So they spoke of other things.,f
33558,"He learned that she had come from a distant city to visit relatives, and the aunt invited him to call upon them.",f
33559,"Friday afternoon came at last, when Miss Grey and her aunt were at home.",f
33560,"Other Fridays followed, and other days which served as well as Fridays.",f
33561,"It was seldom that the girl looked him in the face; but when she did so, he felt himself confessed before her--a man with no right to touch even the hem of her garment, yet honouring her with every fibre of his being.",f
33562,They were much together and Constance took a frank enjoyment in his friendship.,f
33563,"He made every effort to please her, and one day they went into the country.",f
33564,"Constance was almost childishly happy, but the seeming perfection of her happiness distressed him when he learned that in a very few days she was to sail for Europe, pass the summer and autumn in travel, and spend the winter in Paris.",f
33565,At length they sat down under a gnarled oak tree and watched the light upon the river and in the sky.,f
33566,"After an embarrassing silence Hayward spoke:  ""I think you know the man now,--will you tell me what you think of his pictures?""",f
33567,She hesitated.,f
33568,"""I do not know the man well enough to say, but I will give you my art creed, and let you judge for yourself.",f
33569,"I believe that a man's art is neither more nor less than the expression of himself, and that, in order to obtain an exalted expression, his first business is with himself.",f
33570,"Wrong living blunts, and eventually destroys, the fundamental sense of right and wrong without which a noble art is impossible.",f
33571,"When a man's art is true, it is because he himself is true.",f
33572,"The true artist must be a man first, and an artist afterward.""",f
33573,Hayward took her admonition with the meekness becoming his position as her worshipper.,f
33574,The conversation ended with his declaration that he would not paint again until he had something in himself which was worthy of being put into his picture.,f
33575,"""You'll help me, won't you?"" he asked.",f
33576,Her eyes filled.,f
33577,"""Indeed I will, if I only can.""",f
33578,He went home with love's fever in his veins.,f
33579,"She had promised to help him, and surely there was only one way.",f
33580,"He wrote her an ardent note, and an hour later his messenger brought her reply.",f
33581,"""Believe me, I never dreamed of this, and you know what my answer must   be; but I do not need to tell you that whatever sincere and honest   friendship can offer is already yours.",f
33582,"""With deep regret, I am as ever,   ""CONSTANCE GREY.""",f
33583,The grim humour of the thing stunned him momentarily and he laughed harshly.,f
33584,Then he flung himself down in a passion of grief.,f
33585,"In the morning he took pen and paper again, after a night of sleepless distress.",f
33586,"""You cannot mean what you say.",f
33587,That white womanly soul of yours   must wake to love me some day.,f
33588,"You have stood between me and the   depths, and there has been no shame in the life that I offer you,   since you came into it.",f
33589,"""Oh, you perfect thing, you perfect thing, you don't know what you   are to me!",f
33590,"Constance, let me come!""",f
33591,"The answer was promptly forthcoming:    ""I cannot promise what you ask, but you may come and see me if you   wish.""",f
33592,"Pale with expectancy, Hayward was only the ghost of himself when the servant admitted him.",f
33593,He had waited but a moment when Constance entered the room wearing the gown in which he had first seen her.,f
33594,"He rose to meet her, but she came and sat down by his side.",f
33595,"""Listen,"" she said, ""and I will tell you how I feel.",f
33596,I am twenty-five and I have never 'cared.',f
33597,"I do not believe that I ever shall care, for the love that we read of is almost incomprehensible to me.",f
33598,"You cannot marry such a woman.""",f
33599,"His answer was fervent, his words crowded one upon another in a vehement flood, and his voice was low and hoarse with pent-up emotion, as he implored her to believe in him, trust him, and be his wife,--kneeling at her feet and kissing her hands in abject humility.",f
33600,"It was very hard for her to say what she must, but with an effort she rose and drew away from him.",f
33601,"""I must be true to myself and to you,"" she said, ""and I can say nothing but the old bitter No.""",f
33602,"White and wretched, he went away, leaving her white and wretched behind him.",f
33603,"For days and weeks thereafter, Hayward painted busily.",f
33604,Jennings went to see him one afternoon.,f
33605,"""Look here, old fellow,"" he said, ""what's the matter?",f
33606,"I know I was ungentlemanly about the handkerchief, but that's no reason why you should cut us all this way.",f
33607,"Can't you forget about it?""",f
33608,"""Why, Jennings, old boy, I haven't cut anybody.""",f
33609,"""No, but you've tired of us, and you can't hide it.",f
33610,Come down the river with us to-night.,f
33611,"The fellows have got a yacht, and we'll have supper on board with plenty of champagne.",f
33612,"Won't you come?""",f
33613,Hayward was seriously tempted.,f
33614,"He knew what ""the time"" would mean--the ecstasy of it and the dull penalties which would follow.",f
33615,"But that day by the river came into his memory: a sweet sunlit face, and a woman's voice saying to him: ""When a man's art is true, it is because he himself is true.""",f
33616,"""Jennings,"" he said, ""do I look like a man who would make good company at a champagne supper?",f
33617,You know what's the matter with me.,f
33618,"Why don't you just sensibly drop me?""",f
33619,"Jennings begged, and mocked, and bullied, all in a good-natured way, but his friend was firm.",f
33620,"When he went out, Hayward locked the studio door and drew his half finished picture from behind a screen.",f
33621,"""She was right,"" he said to himself.",f
33622,Constance sailed.,f
33623,"He dreamed of his picture as being hung in the Salon, and of her seeing it there.",f
33624,"By and by it was finished, but the artist's strength was gone, and his physician ordered him away from his work.",f
33625,"When he returned, restored to health, the picture was placed on exhibition.",f
33626,"Crowds thronged the gallery, columns and pages were written in its praise, and astonishing prices were offered for it, but the picture was not for sale.",f
33627,"It, too, crossed the water, and the dream which had comforted him for many months at last came true.",f
33628,"When Constance looked upon Hayward's painting, her heart leaped as if it would leave her breast.",f
33629,"White, radiant, and glorified, it was she herself who stood in the centre of the canvas.",f
33630,"That self-reliant, fearless pose seemed to radiate infinite calm.",f
33631,"Behind her raged the powers of darkness, utterly helpless to pass the line on which she stood.",f
33632,Her face seemed to illumine the shadows around her; her figure was instinct with grace and strength.,f
33633,Below the picture was the name: _The White Shield_.,f
33634,The beauty of the conception dawned upon her slowly.,f
33635,"Pale and trembling, she stood there, forgetful of the place, and the throng around her.",f
33636,At length she knew what she meant to him; that his art at last rang true because he had loved her enough to be a man for her sake.,f
33637,"She dared not linger before it then, but she came again when the place was empty, and stood before her lover's work, like one in a dream.",f
33638,The fiends in the shadow showed her the might of the temptations he had fought down.,f
33639,She gazed at her own glorified face until her eyes filled with tears.,f
33640,"With a great throb which was almost pain, Constance woke to the knowledge that she loved him, even as he loved her--well enough to stand between him and danger till she herself should fall.",f
33641,"The old grey guard, passing through the room, saw her upturned face in that moment of exaltation.",f
33642,"It was the same that he saw in the picture above, and he quietly went away to wait until Constance came out, her face flushed and her eyes shining like stars, before he locked the door.",f
33643,That night the cable trembled with a message to America.,f
33644,It reached Hayward the next morning as he sat reading the daily paper.,f
33645,"The envelope fluttered unheeding to the floor, and his face grew tender then radiant as he read the few words which told him that his picture had rewarded his love.",f
33646,"""Wait,"" he said to the messenger boy.",f
33647,"Hurriedly he wrote the answer: ""Sailing next steamer""--then, utterly oblivious of the additional expense, he added another word, which must have been very expressive, for Constance turned crimson when it reached her--perhaps because the discerning genius who copies cablegrams in typewriting had put the last word in capitals, thinking that the message came from a Mr. Darling.",f
33648,An International Affair     An International Affair   The Committee of Literary Extension was holding its first meeting.,f
33649,Five girls sat around a glowing gas log and nibbled daintily at some chocolates which had been sent to the hostess.,f
33650,"""Come, Margaret, you're the chairman of this committee; please tell us what it is all for,"" suggested Grace Hayes.",f
33651,"""Well, girls, I hardly know how to begin.",f
33652,Most of us in travelling have seen those little huts along the railroad with a little bit of cultivated ground around each one.,f
33653,They are the very embodiment of desolation.,f
33654,"I have seen whole families come out to stare at the train as it whirled by, and I have often wondered what place there could be for such people in this beautiful, happy world--why I should have my books and friends and the thousand other things that have been given to me, while other people, and worst of all, other women, have to live lives like that.",f
33655,"""There are boys upon farms, in reform schools, and in little towns who scarcely ever see even a newspaper, and who do not know what a magazine is.",f
33656,"""It is to reach this class of people that this work has been undertaken, and for this purpose our committee has been appointed.",f
33657,Fifteen or twenty magazines and illustrated papers come to us every month--even to the few who are here to-day: perhaps some of you see even more than this.,f
33658,"After we have read them, we might send them to these people instead of burning them, and who can tell how many starving minds we may make better, and happier, in this simple way, and with very little effort on our part?""",f
33659,"""Can they read?""",f
33660,"It was Grace, an always practical individual, who spoke.",f
33661,"""If they can't, they can learn,"" responded Miss Stone.",f
33662,"""It will be an incentive to their best efforts in every way.""",f
33663,"Katherine Bryant leaned forward, her face flushed, and her eyes shining.",f
33664,"""Girls,"" she said, ""it's perfectly beautiful.",f
33665,"We'll send all of our own magazines and illustrated papers, all we can collect from other sources, and we'll raise money to buy new ones.",f
33666,"I don't know of any other way in which we can do so much good.""",f
33667,"Plan after plan was suggested, and at last it was decided that the committee should write to a society in Boston which did similar work, and ask for the names and addresses of twenty-five persons who were in need of reading matter.",f
33668,"These could be removed from the lists of the Boston society, as the Committee on Literary Extension of the Detroit Young Woman's Club would attend to their needs in future.",f
33669,"In due time the list arrived, with a few particulars opposite each name.",f
33670,"The committee was again called together, and the chairman gave each girl five names.",f
33671,"""Katherine dear,"" she said, ""there are some more names in the little note-book that is up-stairs in my desk.",f
33672,They are all boys who have left the reform school.,f
33673,"A friend of mine, who is one of the directors, gave them to me, and there are only four or five.",f
33674,"Would you mind taking those in addition to your own?""",f
33675,"""Not at all,"" and Katherine ran up to Margaret's desk.",f
33676,"""Wonder where she keeps her note-book!",f
33677,"Oh, here it is, and here is the list.""",f
33678,She copied busily.,f
33679,"""One, two, three, four; that's all.",f
33680,"No, here's another on the next page,"" and at the end of her slip she wrote: ""Robert Ross, Athol, Spink Co., South Dakota.""",f
33681,The work was taken up in earnest and many magazines were collected within the next few days.,f
33682,"A strict account was kept of everything sent out, and occasionally the girls met to compare notes.",f
33683,Margaret came home one day and found Mrs. Boyce waiting for her.,f
33684,"""My dear,"" said the lady, ""I've lost an address that troubles me, and I think it may have been on the card that I gave you the other day.""",f
33685,"""I'll see,"" replied Margaret, ""I copied them all that very afternoon.""",f
33686,She took her note-book out of her chatelaine bag and handed it to Mrs. Boyce.,f
33687,"""Which one is it?""",f
33688,The elder lady laughed in a relieved way.,f
33689,"""This last one,"" she answered.",f
33690,"""Robert Ross.",f
33691,"He's my favourite nephew, off on a shooting trip, and he wants me to write to him.",f
33692,"He'd never forgive me, if I didn't.",f
33693,"Just give me a card, and I will try not to be so careless again.""",f
33694,Meanwhile Katherine was absorbed in addressing magazines with great vigour.,f
33695,She had found a pile of back numbers in the attic and was trying to divide them properly.,f
33696,"The household journals went to a woman in Kansas, fifty miles from a city, others she mailed to a boy of sixteen who was on a farm in Minnesota, and a copy of a popular magazine was addressed to Mr. Robert Ross.",f
33697,"At the top of each one she had written, ""From Miss Katherine Bryant, Jefferson Ave., Detroit.""",f
33698,"A short time afterward, she received a pathetic letter from the woman to whom she had sent the household magazines.",f
33699,"""I married for love,"" she wrote, ""and have never been sorry, but I miss many of the things to which I was accustomed in my eastern home.",f
33700,"A magazine is an unusual thing upon a Kansas farm, and with all my heart I thank you for the great pleasure you have given a lonely woman.""",f
33701,"Mindful of the fact that one of the objects of the committee was to get into correspondence with its beneficiaries, Katherine sat down to write an encouraging note to her and also to others, but before she had finished the postman brought another letter.",f
33702,It had been mailed in South Dakota.,f
33703,"The paper was the white ruled variety, to be found in country stores, but the penmanship was clear and business-like.",f
33704,"""My dear Miss Bryant,"" the letter began, ""I am sure I don't know what   good angel possessed you to send me a copy of my favourite magazine,   but I am none the less grateful and only too happy to acknowledge it.",f
33705,"I   am hurt, but the doctor thinks not seriously, and that I shall be all   right in a few weeks.",f
33706,The magazine which you so kindly sent has given   me the first pleasant day I have had for some time.,f
33707,"""I should be most happy to receive a letter from you, but of course   that is too much for a stranger to ask, even though he be ill and alone.",f
33708,"""Sincerely and gratefully yours,   ""ROBERT ROSS.""",f
33709,"Katherine knit her pretty brows, and read it over again.",f
33710,"""It's no queerer than the one I got from the Kansas woman,"" she decided.",f
33711,"""At any rate, they both seem glad to get them and they shall have some more.""",f
33712,"She wrote very kindly to Robert Ross, inquiring into the particulars of his injury, and whether or not he lived on a farm.",f
33713,"She said he was very fortunate, if he did indeed live in the country, because so many people were pining away and dying in the great cities.",f
33714,"The magazine she had sent was one of her own favourites also, and she would send the next number as soon as it came out.",f
33715,"In the meantime, she hoped the package of papers she was sending in the same mail would prove acceptable.",f
33716,"Out on the porch of the Athol House, Mr. Ross sat in the sun and reviled creation in general.",f
33717,It was a palatial hotel--for that region--but he seemed unmindful of his advantages.,f
33718,"""Oh, confound it,"" he groaned, ""why couldn't I have shot some other idiot instead of myself?",f
33719,I ought not to be trusted with a gun!,f
33720,"Right in the height of the prairie chicken season too, and those other fellows, three of them, off bagging every bit of the game!",f
33721,"I hope they won't forget to come back this way, and take me home with them!",f
33722,"Emperor, old fellow, it's hard luck.",f
33723,"Isn't it?""",f
33724,"The Irish setter, who had been addressed, came and put his cold nose into Mr. Ross's hand.",f
33725,"The well-bred dog had refused to desert his wounded master, even for the charms of prairie chickens, and touched by his dumb devotion Ross permitted him to stay.",f
33726,"Long conversations were held every day, and Emperor told Ross as plainly as a dog could, that if it hadn't been for that dreadful flesh wound they would be having a fine time in the fields, capturing more game than any other dog and man in the party.",f
33727,When the landlord returned from the post-office he brought a letter which Emperor carried in triumph to his master.,f
33728,Ross read it in surprise.,f
33729,"Who Miss Bryant might be, he did not know, but she wrote a pleasant letter, and it was certainly kind of her to notice him.",f
33730,He decided that the letter he wrote in acknowledgment of the magazine must have been extremely well done.,f
33731,"He thought of the unknown fair one for some time, and then concluded to write again.",f
33732,"He was non-committal about himself, fearing to spoil any delusion she might have been labouring under when she sent the magazine.",f
33733,"When Katherine received the second letter, she felt several pricks of conscience.",f
33734,"It wasn't a nice thing she was doing, and she knew it.",f
33735,"But a person shouldn't let squeamishness interfere with philanthropic work, so she answered promptly.",f
33736,"She drew him into a discussion of an article on ""The Desirability of Annexing Canada to the United States,"" and he criticised it harshly.",f
33737,He forgot to tell her that he was a Canadian by birth and a loyal subject of the King.,f
33738,"His point of view was naturally distorted, and she replied with some spirit, dealing very patiently, however, with the frail arguments which he had submitted.",f
33739,Katherine thought the discussion was a good thing.,f
33740,Anything that would make him think was an unmixed blessing.,f
33741,"She fairly glowed as she thought of the mental stimulus she might give to this poor Dakota farmer, who had been hurt in some mysterious way, and her letters grew longer even as they increased in frequency, for Mr. Ross wrote very promptly indeed.",f
33742,"She could well understand that, when a cripple had so little to occupy his time in that far away wilderness.",f
33743,Ross was highly amused.,f
33744,He admired Miss Bryant's letters and wished he might see Miss Bryant herself.,f
33745,A bright idea (as he thought) occurred to him--why not?,f
33746,"With very red cheeks, Miss Katherine read the latest news from Spink County.",f
33747,"Her own beautiful Irish setter put his head into her lap, and begged to be petted.",f
33748,"""Go away, Rex, I want to think.",f
33749,The wretch!,f
33750,To ask for my photograph!,f
33751,He evidently doesn't know his place!,f
33752,"I'll teach him where it is and then take the name of the impertinent creature off my list!""",f
33753,"She sat down to compose a letter which should make Mr. Robert Ross, alias wretch, squirm in agony.",f
33754,Rex was persistent and put his paw up to shake hands.,f
33755,Katherine turned and looked at him.,f
33756,"""You're a dreadfully nice doggie, but I wish you'd go away and not bother me.""",f
33757,"Then an idea came to her which startled her at first, but grew more attractive as she became better acquainted with it.",f
33758,"She bent down and whispered to Rex, and he wagged his tail as if he fully understood.",f
33759,"""Yes, Rex, it's got to be done.",f
33760,"I'm sorry to sacrifice any of your beauty, but you've got to get your mistress out of a scrape.",f
33761,"Come on!""",f
33762,And the willing Rex was escorted into the back yard.,f
33763,"Sooner than he expected, Mr. Ross found a letter at his plate when he limped in to the customary breakfast of black coffee and fried eggs.",f
33764,"On this occasion, he omitted the eggs and hastily swallowed the coffee, for the envelope was addressed in familiar style.",f
33765,It was a very pleasant letter.,f
33766,"The writer seemed to meet his advances in a proper spirit, but there was no photograph.",f
33767,"""I don't give my pictures to young men, nor old ones either, but I enclose a lock of hair which I have cut off on purpose for you, and I hope you will be pleased with it.""",f
33768,He looked at the enclosure again and again.,f
33769,"It was a single silky curl, of a beautiful reddish gold, tied daintily with blue ribbon.",f
33770,"He certainly was pleased with it, as she had hoped.",f
33771,"""Hair like this and violet eyes,"" soliloquised Ross.",f
33772,"""I must write again without delay.""",f
33773,So when the landlord went to the post-office he mailed another letter to Miss Bryant.,f
33774,The first page consisted wholly of raptures.,f
33775,He began to think that Athol was not so dull a place as he had at first imagined.,f
33776,Those fellows off in the fields shooting prairie chickens were not having any better time than he and Emperor in this thriving town.,f
33777,"It was true that Emperor slept most of the time, but magazines, and papers, and letters not only made the time less tedious, but there seemed to be opening up a vista of romance which made the tramping in the stubbly fields look very much less attractive.",f
33778,"While he thought of it, he would read Miss Bryant's letter again.",f
33779,"He took it out of the envelope, and the curl fell unnoticed to the floor of what the landlord was pleased to term ""the front stoop.""",f
33780,"Emperor walked over, and seemed interested.",f
33781,"His master did not notice him, being absorbed in the letter; at last the dog sniffed uneasily, and then growled, so Ross looked up and was surprised to find him pawing something vigorously.",f
33782,Still Ross did not see what the dog had.,f
33783,"""What's the matter with you, old fellow?""",f
33784,"Emperor growled again, and bit fiercely at the curl.",f
33785,"Its owner rescued it at once, but the dog would not be appeased.",f
33786,He made such a fuss that his master put the letter away.,f
33787,"Then Emperor made another attack on the curl, and Ross took it away from him again and examined it closely.",f
33788,A queer look came into his face and a queerer note into his voice.,f
33789,"""Emperor, come here.",f
33790,"Keep still.""",f
33791,"The long golden fringe that made Emperor's tail the thing of beauty that it was, was drawn up on his knee and the curl was laid beside it.",f
33792,There was no doubt at all.,f
33793,It matched exactly.,f
33794,Ross leaned back in his chair with a low whistle.,f
33795,"""Well--by--Jove!",f
33796,"I wonder if she'll tell me when she writes,"" he said to himself.",f
33797,"With a despairing grin, he remembered his raptures on the subject and decided that Miss Bryant would be very certain to tell him where that ""sweet curl"" came from!",f
33798,"When the missive from Spink County reached Detroit, Miss Katherine Bryant was a very happy girl.",f
33799,"As a rule, it takes very little to make girls happy.",f
33800,"For the first time in her life, she longed for a confidant, and unlike most girls, she had none.",f
33801,She took Rex for a long walk and told him all about it.,f
33802,"The poor dismantled tail wagged in ecstasy, but his mistress was not sure that he understood the joke in its entirety.",f
33803,At last she would have her revenge and she took keen delight in answering that letter.,f
33804,"""I quite agree with you concerning the beauty of the hair,"" she wrote.",f
33805,"""It came from my beautiful Irish setter, and I am very glad you are pleased with it, though to tell the truth, I should think you utterly heartless if you were not.""",f
33806,"Ross sent an elaborate apology for his impertinence, and confessed that he admired her all the more for outwitting him.",f
33807,"Inwardly, he wished that Emperor had made his discovery before he had mailed that idiotic letter.",f
33808,"His manliness, however, appealed to Katherine and she did not take his name off the list.",f
33809,"In the meantime, the three other men returned to their wounded comrade.",f
33810,They had been very successful and were profuse in their expressions of regret.,f
33811,Ross said nothing of his unknown friend.,f
33812,"He felt that it would not be fair to her, and anyhow, when a girl has sent you dog-hair, and you have raved over it, it isn't best to tell of it.",f
33813,He was sure that all the circumstances were in favour of his keeping still about it.,f
33814,The ugly wound had quite healed when the four men started East together.,f
33815,At St.,f
33816,"Paul they separated, Ross and Emperor taking the night train for Detroit and the promised visit to Mrs. Boyce.",f
33817,"She was delighted to see her nephew, and Emperor soon found his way into her good graces.",f
33818,"His master took him out for a stroll the same day he arrived, the dog having been long confined in a box-car, and the released captive found his excursion especially refreshing.",f
33819,"At a corner, however, he met another Irish setter, also out for a stroll, and the two speedily entered into a violent discussion.",f
33820,"A snarling, rolling, mahogany-coloured ball rolled toward Ross, and a young lady followed, crying at the top of her voice, ""Rex!",f
33821,Rex!,f
33822,"Come here.""",f
33823,"The owner of Emperor rushed into the disturbance with his cane, and succeeded in resolving the ball into its component parts.",f
33824,"Rex, panting and injured, was restored to his agitated mistress, while Emperor chafed at his master's restraining hand.",f
33825,Apologies were profuse on both sides.,f
33826,"""I'm stronger than you,"" Ross said, ""and if you can hold your dog until I get mine out of sight, we shall have no more trouble.""",f
33827,"Miss Bryant scolded Rex until his head and tail drooped with shame, and relentlessly kept him at heel all the way home.",f
33828,"At her own gate, she met Margaret Stone, to whom she told the story of her adventure with the handsome stranger, and the other dog, who ""looked so much like Rex that his own mother could not have told them apart!""",f
33829,Margaret's errand was a brief one.,f
33830,Mrs. Boyce was coming over to the Stone mansion with her nephew and she wanted Katherine to come to dinner and stay all night.,f
33831,"So Katherine put on her prettiest gown and went over, little thinking what fate had in store for her.",f
33832,She instantly recognised in Ross the man she had met a few hours before under very different circumstances.,f
33833,"He was too much of a gentleman to allude to the occurrence, but she flushed uncomfortably.",f
33834,Both girls found him an exceedingly pleasant fellow.,f
33835,"Katherine had recovered from her embarrassment, and was laughing happily, when Mrs. Boyce began to speak of the Committee on Literary Extension and the good work the girls were doing.",f
33836,"""Do you know, Bob,"" she went on, ""that I nearly lost your address in that way?",f
33837,I gave it to Margaret with the names of some boys from the Reform School.,f
33838,"It's a blessed wonder you didn't get magazines and tracts!""",f
33839,"If Robert had been an angel he would not have looked at Katherine, but being merely human he did.",f
33840,Miss Bryant rose in a dignified manner.,f
33841,"""Margaret,"" she said unsteadily, ""I must go home.""",f
33842,"""Why, Katherine, you were going to stay all night!""",f
33843,"""My--head--aches,"" she answered.",f
33844,"""Bob,"" commanded Mrs. Boyce, ""you must take Katherine home.""",f
33845,"""It's not at all necessary,"" pleaded Katherine piteously.",f
33846,"""But I insist,"" repeated Mrs. Boyce with the utmost good will.",f
33847,Mr. Ross rose.,f
33848,"""If Miss Bryant will permit me, I shall be only too glad to accompany her home,"" he said courteously.",f
33849,There was nothing to do but submit with the best grace she could assume.,f
33850,"Once out of doors, she was the first to break the silence:  ""I'm afraid to be out alone--in the city.""",f
33851,"""Yes,"" replied her escort cheerily, ""it's a pity you didn't bring your dog!""",f
33852,"He could have bitten his tongue out for making such an unlucky speech, but to his surprise Katherine broke down and sobbed hysterically.",f
33853,Mr. Ross took both her hands in his own.,f
33854,"""You are tired and nervous, Miss Bryant, and I beg you to think no more about what has happened.",f
33855,"You have no idea how much good you did me out in that miserable little place, and I shall be only too glad to be your friend, if you will let me.""",f
33856,"Katherine wiped her eyes: ""If you can be my friend, I ought to be very willing to be yours,"" and just outside of her door Canada and the United States clasped hands in a solemn treaty of peace.",f
33857,"Safely in her own room, the mistress of Rex sat down before the mirror and studied her face attentively.",f
33858,"""Katherine Bryant,"" she said to herself, ""you are an idiot!",f
33859,"Not foolish, nor silly, nor half witted, nor anything like that--just a plain idiot!",f
33860,"He has graduated from the University with high honours, and you, with your miserable little boarding-school education, have instructed him on many subjects.",f
33861,"I am thoroughly ashamed of you.""",f
33862,"When she finally slept, her dreams were a medley of handsome strangers, mixed with dogs, and reddish-yellow curls tied up with blue ribbons.",f
33863,"Leaning up against the corner lamp-post, Mr. Robert Ross indulged in a spasm of irreverent mirth, but with a great effort he preserved a calm exterior when he again entered the drawing-room of his hostess.",f
33864,"On their way home Mrs. Boyce said: ""Bob, why don't you go into business with your uncle and become a good American citizen?",f
33865,"We'd love to have you with us, and there is surely a good opening here.""",f
33866,"""I'll think about it,"" he answered, and he did, with the usual result, for it is proverbial that he who hesitates is lost.",f
33867,"Mr. Boyce was quite willing to shift a part of his responsibility to the broad shoulders of his nephew, and an agreement was easily reached.",f
33868,"Emperor was quartered in the back yard, where he fretted for a few days and then wreaked his vengeance on sundry grocery boys and milkmen.",f
33869,"When his master went out, the dog usually went along except when Miss Bryant and Rex were to be favoured with a call.",f
33870,"If the two dogs met, the customary disturbance ensued.",f
33871,"Rex included Ross in his hatred of Emperor, and Emperor was equally hostile toward Miss Bryant.",f
33872,"""Rex,"" said Katherine, one day, ""you are a very nice doggie, but I won't have you treat Mr. Ross with such disrespect.",f
33873,"The other night, when we were going out, you had no business to growl when he buttoned my gloves, nor to sniff in that disgusted way at the roses he brought.",f
33874,"If you ever do that again, I shall let the dogcatcher take you to the pound!""",f
33875,"The imaginary spectacle of Rex en route to the pound nearly unnerved Katherine, but she felt that she must be severe.",f
33876,"Ross punished Emperor with a chain, or with confinement in the back yard, which the dog hated, but where it was necessary to keep him a part of the time, and for a while all went well.",f
33877,But Ross went away one evening without explaining matters to the sensitive being in the back yard.,f
33878,Emperor knew well enough where he had gone--knew he was visiting that disagreeable girl who owned that other Irish setter--a very impertinent dog whose manners were so bad that he was a disgrace to the whole setter tribe!,f
33879,"He sulked over his wrongs for an hour or so, and then crawled out through a friendly hole in the fence which he had for some time past been spending his hours of imprisonment in making.",f
33880,"The dining-room of the house on the avenue was lighted by a single gas jet, and the shades were lowered.",f
33881,Miss Bryant and the chafing dish together had evolved a rarebit which made the inner man glow with pleasure.,f
33882,"""Do you remember that awful quarrel we had about annexing Canada to the United States?"" asked Robert.",f
33883,Katherine remembered distinctly.,f
33884,He went over to her side of the table.,f
33885,"""What do you think about it now?""",f
33886,"It was a very ordinary question, but Miss Bryant turned scarlet.",f
33887,"""I--I don't know,"" she faltered.",f
33888,He put his arm around her.,f
33889,"""I give in,"" he said;",f
33890,"""annexation is the most desirable thing in the world--when shall it take place?""",f
33891,Katherine raised her head timidly.,f
33892,"""Say it, sweetheart,"" he whispered tenderly.",f
33893,It happened at this moment that Emperor arrived in search of his master.,f
33894,Rex was sitting on the front steps and declined to take in his card.,f
33895,"Then the shrieking, howling barking ball rolled into the vestibule, and Ross made a dash for the door.",f
33896,"With considerable effort he got Rex into the back yard, and locked Emperor into the vestibule.",f
33897,Then he went back to Katherine.,f
33898,"He tried to speak lightly, but his voice trembled with earnestness: ""Dearest, this entire affair has been coloured, and suggested by, and mixed up with dogs.",f
33899,"I think now there will be an interval of peace for at least ten minutes, and I am asking you to marry me.""",f
33900,"Rex raised his voice in awful protest, and Emperor replied angrily to the challenge, as he raged back and forth in the vestibule, but Robert heard Katherine's tremulous ""Yes"" with a throb of joy which even the consciousness of warring elements outside could not lessen.",f
33901,"The little figure against his breast shook with something very like a giggle, and Katherine's eyes shining with merriment met his with the question: ""What on earth shall we do with the dogs?""",f
33902,"Robert laughed and drew her closer: ""It's strictly international, isn't it?",f
33903,"Canada and the United States quarrel----""  ""And Ireland arbitrates!"" said Katherine.",f
33904,"Three months later, in the drawing-room on Jefferson Avenue, to the accompaniment of flowers, lights, and soft music, the treaty was declared permanent.",f
33905,"There was a tiny dark coloured footprint on the end of Katherine's train, which no one appeared to notice, and a white silk handkerchief carefully arranged hid from public view a slightly larger spot on the shining linen of the bridegroom, where Emperor had registered his enthusiastic approval of his master's apparel.",f
33906,"But the rest of the committee, in pale green gowns, were bridesmaids, while Emperor and Rex, resplendent in new collars, and having temporarily adjusted their difference as long as they were under guard, had seats of honour among the guests.",f
33907,A Child of Silence     A Child of Silence   At the end of the street stood the little white house which Jack Ward was pleased to call his own.,f
33908,"Five years he had lived there, he and Dorothy.",f
33909,How happy they had been!,f
33910,"But things seemed to have gone wrong some way, since--since the baby died in the spring.",f
33911,"A sob came into Jack's throat, for the little face had haunted him all day.",f
33912,"Never a sound had the baby lips uttered, and the loudest noises had not disturbed his rest.",f
33913,"It had seemed almost too much to bear, but they had loved him more, if that were possible, because he was not as other children were.",f
33914,"Jack had never been reconciled but Dorothy found a world of consolation in the closing paragraph of a magazine article on the subject:  ""And yet we cannot believe these Children of Silence to be unhappy.",f
33915,"Mrs. Browning says that 'closed eyes see more truly than ever open do,' and may there not be another world of music for those to whom our own is soundless?",f
33916,"In a certain sense they are utterly beyond the pain that life always brings, for never can they hear the cruel words beside which physical hurts sink into utter insignificance.",f
33917,"So pity them not, but believe that He knoweth best, and that what seems wrong and bitter is often His truest kindness to His children.""",f
33918,Dorothy read it over and over until she knew it by heart.,f
33919,There was a certain comfort in the thought that he need not suffer--that he need never find what a world of bitterness lies in that one little word--life.,f
33920,"And when the hard day came she tried to be thankful, for she knew that he was safer still--tried to see the kindness that had taken him back into the Unknown Silence of which he was the Child.",f
33921,"Jack went up the steps this mild winter evening, whistling softly to himself, and opened the door with his latch-key.",f
33922,"""Where are you, girlie?""",f
33923,"""Up stairs, dear.",f
33924,"I'll be down in a minute,"" and even as she spoke Dorothy came into the room.",f
33925,"In spite of her black gown and the hollows under her eyes, she was a pretty woman.",f
33926,"She knew it, and Jack did too.",f
33927,"That is he had known, but he had forgotten.",f
33928,"""Here's the evening paper.""",f
33929,He tossed it into her lap as she sat down by the window.,f
33930,"""Thank you.""",f
33931,"She wondered vaguely why Jack did not kiss her as he used to, and then dismissed the thought.",f
33932,She was growing accustomed to that sort of thing.,f
33933,"""How nice of you to come by the early train!",f
33934,"I didn't expect you until later.""",f
33935,"""There wasn't much going on in town, so I left the office early.",f
33936,Any mail?,f
33937,No?,f
33938,"Guess I'll take Jip out for a stroll.""",f
33939,The fox-terrier at his feet wagged his tail approvingly.,f
33940,"""Want to go, Jip?""",f
33941,Jip answered decidedly in the affirmative.,f
33942,"""All right, come on,"" and Dorothy watched the two go down the street with an undefined feeling of pain.",f
33943,"She lit the prettily shaded lamp and tried to read the paper, but the political news, elopements, murders, and suicides lacked interest.",f
33944,She wondered what had come between her and Jack.,f
33945,"Something had, there was no question about that; but--well, it would come straight sometime.",f
33946,Perhaps she was morbid and unjust.,f
33947,She couldn't ask him what was the matter without making him angry and she had tried so hard to make him happy.,f
33948,Jip announced his arrival at the front door with a series of sharp barks and an unmistakable scratch.,f
33949,"She opened it as Jack sauntered slowly up the walk and passed her with the remark:  ""Dinner ready?",f
33950,"I'm as hungry as a bear.""",f
33951,"Into the cozy dining-room they went, Jip first, then Jack, then Dorothy.",f
33952,"The daintily served meal satisfied the inner man, and he did not notice that she ate but little.",f
33953,"She honestly tried to be entertaining, and thought she succeeded fairly well.",f
33954,"After dinner he retired into the depths of the evening paper, and Dorothy stitched away at her embroidery.",f
33955,Suddenly Jack looked at his watch.,f
33956,"""Well, it's half past seven, and I've got to go over to Mrs. Brown's and practise a duet with her for to-morrow.""",f
33957,"Dorothy trembled, but only said: ""Oh, yes, the duet.",f
33958,"What is it this time?""",f
33959,"""'Calvary,' I guess, that seems to take the multitude better than anything we sing.",f
33960,"No, Jip, not this time.",f
33961,"Good-bye, I won't be gone long.""",f
33962,"The door slammed, and Dorothy was alone.",f
33963,She put away her embroidery and walked the floor restlessly.,f
33964,"Mrs. Brown was a pretty widow, always well dressed, and she sang divinely.",f
33965,"Dorothy could not sing a note though she played fairly well, and Jack got into a habit of taking Mrs. Brown new music and going over to sing it with her.",f
33966,An obliging neighbour had called that afternoon and remarked maliciously that Mr. Ward and Mrs. Brown seemed to be very good friends.,f
33967,"Dorothy smiled with white lips, and tried to say pleasantly, ""Yes, Mrs. Brown is very charming, don't you think so?",f
33968,"I am sure that if I were a man I should fall in love with her.""",f
33969,"The neighbour rose to go and by way of a parting shot replied: ""That seems to be Mr. Ward's idea.",f
33970,"Lovely day, isn't it?",f
33971,"Come over when you can.""",f
33972,Dorothy was too stunned to reply.,f
33973,"She thought seriously of telling Jack, but wisely decided not to.",f
33974,These suburban towns were always gossipy.,f
33975,Jack would think she did not trust him.,f
33976,And now he was at Mrs. Brown's again!,f
33977,The pain was almost blinding.,f
33978,She went to the window and looked out.,f
33979,The rising moon shone fitfully upon the white signs of sorrow in the little churchyard far to the left.,f
33980,She threw a shawl over her head and went out.,f
33981,"In feverish haste she walked over to the little ""God's Acre"" where the Child of Silence was buried.",f
33982,She found the spot and sat down.,f
33983,"A thought of Mrs. Browning's ran through her mind:    ""Thank God, bless God, all ye who suffer not   More grief than ye can weep for----""  Then someway the tears came, a blessed rush of relief.",f
33984,"""Oh, baby dear,"" she sobbed, pressing her lips to the cold turf above him, ""I wish I were down there beside you, as still and as dreamless as you.",f
33985,You don't know what it means--you never would have known.,f
33986,I'd rather be a stone than a woman with a heart.,f
33987,Do you think that if I could buy death I wouldn't take it and come down there beside you?,f
33988,"It hurt me to lose you, but it wasn't the worst.",f
33989,You would have loved me.,f
33990,"Oh, my Child of Silence!",f
33991,"Come back, come back!""",f
33992,"How long she stayed there she never knew, but the heart pain grew easier after a while.",f
33993,She pressed her lips to the turf again.,f
33994,"""Good night, baby dear, good night.",f
33995,I'll come again.,f
33996,"You haven't lost your mother even if she has lost you!""",f
33997,"Fred Bennett passed by the unfrequented spot, returning from an errand to that part of town, and he heard the last words.",f
33998,He drew back into the shadow.,f
33999,The slight black figure appeared on the sidewalk a few feet ahead of him and puzzled him not a little.,f
34000,He followed cautiously and finally decided to overtake her.,f
34001,As she heard his step behind her she looked around timidly.,f
34002,"""Mrs. Ward!""",f
34003,"His tone betrayed surprise, and he saw that her eyes were wet and her white, drawn face was tear-stained.",f
34004,She shuddered.,f
34005,A new trouble faced her.,f
34006,How long had he been following her?,f
34007,He saw her distress and told his lie bravely.,f
34008,"""I just came around the corner here.""",f
34009,"Her relieved look was worth the sacrifice of his conscientious scruples, he said to himself afterward.",f
34010,"""I may walk home with you, may I not?""",f
34011,"""Certainly.""",f
34012,She took his offered arm and tried to chat pleasantly with her old friend.,f
34013,Soon they reached the gate.,f
34014,She dropped his arm and said good night unsteadily.,f
34015,Bennett could bear it no longer and he took both of her hands in his own.,f
34016,"""Mrs. Ward, you are in trouble.",f
34017,"Tell me, perhaps I can help you.""",f
34018,She was silent.,f
34019,"""Dorothy, you will let me call you so, will you not?",f
34020,"You know how much I cared for you in a boy's impulsive fashion, in the old days when we were at school; you know that I am your friend now--as true a friend as a man can be to a woman.",f
34021,"Tell me, Dorothy, and let me help you.""",f
34022,There was a rustle of silk on the pavement and her caller of the afternoon swept by without speaking.,f
34023,Already Dorothy knew the story which would be put in circulation on the morrow.,f
34024,Bennett's clasp tightened on her cold fingers.,f
34025,"""Tell me, Dorothy, and let me help you!"" he said again.",f
34026,"The impulse to tell him grew stronger, and she controlled it with difficulty.",f
34027,"""It is nothing, Mr. Bennett, I--I have a headache.""",f
34028,"""I see, and you came out for a breath of fresh air.",f
34029,Pardon me.,f
34030,I am sure you will be better in the morning.,f
34031,These cool nights are so bracing.,f
34032,"Good night, and God bless you--Dorothy.""",f
34033,Meanwhile Bennett was on his way to Mrs. Brown's cottage.,f
34034,"His mind was made up, and he would speak to Jack.",f
34035,"He had heard a great deal of idle gossip, and it would probably cost him Jack's friendship, but he would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that he had tried to do something for Dorothy.",f
34036,He rang the bell and Mrs. Brown herself answered it.,f
34037,"""Good evening, Mrs. Brown.",f
34038,"No, thank you, I won't come in.",f
34039,"Just ask Jack if I may see him a minute on a matter of business.""",f
34040,"Ward, hearing his friend's voice, was already at the door.",f
34041,"""I'll be with you in a minute, Fred,"" he said.",f
34042,"""Good night, Mrs. Brown;",f
34043,"I am sure we shall get on famously with the duet.""",f
34044,And the two men went slowly down the street.,f
34045,"They walked on in silence until Jack said: ""Well, Bennett, what is it?",f
34046,"You don't call a fellow out like this unless it is something serious.""",f
34047,"""It is serious, Jack; it's Dor--it's Mrs. Ward.""",f
34048,"""Dorothy?",f
34049,"I confess I am as much in the dark as ever.""",f
34050,"""It's this way, Jack, she is in trouble.""",f
34051,Ward was silent.,f
34052,"""Jack, you know I'm a friend of yours;",f
34053,I have been ever since I've known you.,f
34054,"If you don't take what I am going to say as I mean, you are not the man I think you are.""",f
34055,"""Go on, Fred, I understand you.",f
34056,"I was only thinking.""",f
34057,"""Perhaps you don't know it, but the town is agog with what it is pleased to term your infatuation for Mrs. Brown.""",f
34058,"Jack smothered a profane exclamation, and Bennett continued.",f
34059,"""Dorothy is eating her heart out over the baby.",f
34060,She was in the cemetery to-night sobbing over his grave and talking to him like a mad woman.,f
34061,"I came up the back street, and after a little I overtook her and walked home with her.",f
34062,That's how I happen to know.,f
34063,And don't think for a moment that she hasn't heard the gossip.,f
34064,"She has, only she is too proud to speak of it.",f
34065,"And Jack, old man, I don't believe you've neglected her intentionally, but begin again and show her how much you care for her.",f
34066,"Good night.""",f
34067,"Bennett left him abruptly, for the old love for Dorothy was strong to-night; not the fitful flaming passion of boyhood, but the deeper, tenderer love of his whole life.",f
34068,Jack was strangely affected.,f
34069,Dear little Dorothy!,f
34070,He had neglected her.,f
34071,"""I don't deserve her,"" he said to himself, ""but I will.""",f
34072,"He passed a florist's shop, and a tender thought struck him.",f
34073,He would buy Dorothy some roses.,f
34074,He went in and ordered a box of American Beauties.,f
34075,A stiff silk rustled beside him and he lifted his hat courteously.,f
34076,"""Going home, Mr. Ward?",f
34077,"It's early, isn't it?""",f
34078,"""But,"" with scarcely perceptible emphasis, ""it's--none--too soon!""",f
34079,"Then as her eager eye caught a glimpse of the roses, ""Ah, but you men are sly!",f
34080,"For Mrs. Brown?""",f
34081,"Jack took his package and responded icily, ""No, for Mrs. Ward!""",f
34082,"""Cat!"" he muttered under his breath as he went out.",f
34083,And that little word in the mouth of a man means a great deal.,f
34084,"He entered the house, and was not surprised to find that Dorothy had retired.",f

34365,"They were about to turn away when Arnold spoke in a low tone:  ""Look at that girl over there.""",f
34366,The sudden flare of the torch-light revealed the only face in the group which could have attracted Arnold's attention.,f
34367,"It was that of a girl but little past twenty, who stood by the leader holding a tambourine.",f
34368,"She was not beautiful in the accepted sense of the word, but her eyes were deep and lustrous, her mouth sensitive and womanly, and the ugly bonnet could not wholly conceal a wealth of raven hair.",f
34369,"Her skin had a delicate pearly clearness, and upon her face was a look of exaltation and purity as though she stood on some distant elevation, far above the pain and tumult of the world.",f
34370,"After a little, the Salvationists made ready to depart, and Arnold and Clayton turned away.",f
34371,"""I suppose,"" said Clayton, speaking tentatively, and gazing at the girl, ""that we have no right to criticise any belief which puts a look like that upon a woman's face.""",f
34372,"""We have no right to say a word,"" returned Arnold, ""until we have the grace to do some of the things which they do.""",f
34373,"Clayton soon forgot, but the glorified, childish face haunted Arnold.",f
34374,"In the hope of seeing her again, he frequented the curbstones where the meetings were held.",f
34375,"Often, he wondered at the holy peace in the eyes of so young a woman.",f
34376,"He had seen the same expression before, but the face it illumined had always been battle-scarred and weary.",f
34377,"""She hasn't suffered yet,"" he said grimly, ""and that is the thing that tells.""",f
34378,Months passed and summer shaded imperceptibly into autumn.,f
34379,"Then, with little sharp flurries of cold, winter took its place.",f
34380,Arnold was hard at work in that merciless slavery which is found only at the newspaper desk.,f

34382,"""Some day the thing goes wrong, and they find out it's your particular cog, and they get a new one.",f
34383,"That's all there is to it.""",f
34384,"Clayton laughed at his friend's cynicism, as he could well afford to do, for he had just been called to a distant city to fill an important position upon the staff of a larger and more influential journal.",f
34385,"For some time, Arnold's particular cog did yeoman service.",f
34386,"He ground out more ""copy"" than any man on the staff.",f
34387,He had the keenest nose for news--the most delicate way of handling a good story.,f
34388,"Sometimes as he wrote at his desk, the face of the young Salvationist intruded itself between him and his work.",f
34389,"He smiled at his foolish fancy, but dramatic incidents began to take shape about the image of that girl.",f
34390,"He planned ""The Great American Novel""--there is no newspaper man who could not write it, if he only had the time--and she was to be the central figure.",f
34391,All the possibilities of womanhood lay in that sweet Madonna-like face.,f

34393,"His Madonna might suffer or not, but she must grow into her highest and best.",f
34394,"He turned the story over in his mind, studying it from every standpoint.",f
34395,It was not yet ready for paper and pen.,f
34396,"A year went by, and various kinds of trouble came to Arnold.",f
34397,"Something eventually became wrong with the newspaper machine, for he worked only by fits and starts, and at last he was asked for his resignation.",f
34398,"His face was white and determined when he handed it in, but he felt that he was facing failure.",f
34399,"He had a little money laid by for an emergency; at all events, it was enough to supply his wants until he could write his book.",f
34400,"He went at it feverishly, but the work soon began to drag.",f
34401,"The far-off, elusive phantom of his ideal mocked at him behind its expression.",f
34402,"Then he went more slowly still, and, by almost imperceptible degrees, he went steadily down the pitiful ladder which leads from bad to worse.",f
34403,"Ambition faded, hope died, and at last he found himself on a level with humanity at its worst--an outcast of the slums.",f
34404,Strong drink had done its work.,f
34405,"He never knew how he happened to lose the remnant of his self-respect and get into a quarrel with a man distinctly his inferior, nor how he managed to slip on the icy sidewalk and fall heavily against the curbstone.",f
34406,"Merciful unconsciousness blinded him for a time, and when he came to his senses he was in a tiny room, scantily furnished, but exquisitely neat and clean.",f
34407,He was staring at the unfamiliar surroundings when a soft foot-fall sounded beside the bed.,f
34408,He looked up--to meet the clear eyes of the Madonna.,f
34409,"He was about to speak, but she stopped him by a gesture.",f
34410,"""Hush,"" she said, in a voice of mellow sweetness which soothed him inexpressibly, ""you must not talk now.""",f
34411,The touch of her cool fingers on his throbbing temples seemed to ease the pain.,f
34412,He was quite willing to obey her and keep quiet.,f
34413,"It was not until the day following that he knew how badly he had been hurt, and that it would be at least two months before he could walk again.",f
34414,"""Compound fracture,"" the doctor said, and Arnold shuddered, for he had heard of such things before.",f
34415,"As the days went by, the gentle ministry of the Madonna did not for a moment fail.",f
34416,"""I say,"" he said huskily, one morning, ""what makes you so good to me?""",f
34417,The high color mounted to her temples.,f
34418,"""I want you to get well, that's all.""",f
34419,She had a library card and brought books which he suggested.,f
34420,"Her room was near his and often in the night when he was restless with pain, she came in silently, and, holding his hot hand in her cool fingers, read until he went to sleep.",f
34421,"He remembered her afterwards as she sat in the lamplight, her hair falling around her shoulders and over the loose black gown which she wore about the house.",f
34422,Her voice soothed and charmed him.,f
34423,"It was full of lights and, little caressing notes and a haunting sweetness which, someway, he could not forget.",f
34424,"There had been but one woman in his life, and he knew there would be no other.",f
34425,"The broken bones knit slowly, but the doctor was encouraging, and he tried hard to be patient.",f
34426,"He was ashamed to give way to petulance in the presence of this gentle, sweet-voiced woman, whose name he knew, but whom he preferred to call ""Madonna.""",f
34427,"""It means 'my lady',"" he said to her one day, ""and that is what you are to me.""",f
34428,"Through the whole of one painful night she read to him from Mrs. Browning, only resting at short intervals when from very weariness he fell into a short and troubled slumber.",f
34429,"Her education had been sadly neglected, he discovered, but her eager facile mind was quick to comprehend.",f
34430,"She had too, that inner sense of beauty which makes all art its own.",f
34431,"Her voice suited itself to the exquisite melody of the words as she read ""A Denial.""",f
34432,"When it was finished she sat quite still, with a dreamy, far-away look in her eyes.",f
34433,"""Of what are you thinking, Madonna?"" he asked tenderly.",f
34434,"""Of this--of what it must be for a man and woman who love each other to go away like this--because it isn't right for them to be together--never to see each other again.""",f
34435,Then she read once more those four lines which have in them all the strength of loving and all the pain of parting.,f
34436,"""So farewell, thou whom I have met too late     To let thee come so near;",f
34437,"Be happy while men call thee great     And one beloved woman feels thee dear--""  Something tightened around his heart and he took her cold fingers into his own.",f
34438,"""There's nothing in all the world that hurts like that, Madonna.",f
34439,"God keep you from knowing about it, little girl.""",f
34440,"An older woman would have taken warning from his words, but she did not.",f
34441,"The caressing way in which he said ""little girl"" filled her soul with strange joy.",f
34442,"She had a childish, unquestioning faith in him.",f
34443,Some day when he was better--but further than this her maiden thought refused to go.,f
34444,"She simply waited, as a queen might wait for her coronation day.",f
34445,He was planning to repay her kindness if it were in any way possible.,f
34446,"He knew she would not take money from him, but there were other ways.",f
34447,"Flowers--for he knew she loved them--the books that she liked best, and perhaps something for the unfortunates to whom she gave herself so unreservedly.",f
34448,"The winter was over, and April, warm with May's promise, came in through the open window.",f
34449,Even the sullen roar of the city streets could not drown the cheering song of two or three stray birds.,f
34450,"The week before Easter she brought home a tall slender lily in a pot, with a single bud showing at the top of the green shaft.",f
34451,"""They told me it would blossom for Easter,"" she said happily, but she did not tell him she had saved her carfare for days in order to buy it for him.",f
34452,"He was able to sit up now, but she would not let him go until it was quite safe for him to walk.",f
34453,"She seemed to cling, hungrily, to her last days with him.",f
34454,"""After Easter,"" she said bravely, ""I won't keep you.""",f
34455,"He was watching the lily with impatience almost equal to her own, and tiny lines of white appeared on the green sheath.",f
34456,"One day, it seemed as if it would blossom too soon, and again, they feared that it would be after Easter when the perfect flower opened.",f
34457,"""It had to climb up through a pretty dark place to find the light, didn't it, Madonna?"" he asked.",f
34458,"""I suppose that's the way people do, and God knows I've had my share of the dark.""",f
34459,Her eyes filled with tender pity and he went on.,f
34460,"""You know, Madonna, there's a pretty theory to the effect that you must suffer before you amount to anything.",f
34461,"A man can't write nor paint, and a woman can't sing nor play before a cruel hurt.",f
34462,I don't mean the kind that makes a few tears and is followed by forgetfulness--It's the kind that goes right down where you live and cuts and stings and burns.,f
34463,"You never think of it without a shudder, even when the place heals up, if it ever does.",f
34464,"If it's lost friendship, you never have such a friend again--if it's a lost love, you never can care again.",f
34465,"Suffering would make a saint of you, but I don't want you hurt like that--dear little girl.""",f
34466,"He spoke no more, but the questioning maiden eyes sought his.",f
34467,"It was the day before Easter, and on the day following it he was to leave her.",f
34468,"For almost two months, she had been unfailingly kind to him; reading to him night and day, caring for him as though he were a child, and soothing him with her unspoken sympathy.",f
34469,"Memory brought it all to him with peculiar distinctness, and a new impulse came to him--an impulse to lay bare his heart before the deep peaceful eyes of this child.",f
34470,"""Dear little Madonna of the Tambourine,"" he began, ""there's a lot of things I want to tell you before we say good-bye.",f
34471,"""I saw your sweet face at a curbstone meeting once, in the days when I wasn't an outcast, and it's haunted me ever since.",f

34476,"We were happy for a little while, but I couldn't keep away from the cursed drink.",f
34477,That's what put me into the slums.,f
34478,"At last her patience and her love gave out, and she sent me away from her.",f
34479,"She told me to come back to her, either with my shield, or on it, and thanks to you, I'm going back to her to-morrow--with my shield.""",f
34480,"No sound escaped her, but her hand grew cold as ice.",f
34481,"Turning, he looked for those starry eyes once more and, in a sudden flash of understanding, he read her secret.",f
34482,He started to his feet.,f
34483,"""Can it be possible that you--that you--I never dreamed--Oh, Madonna!",f
34484,"Forgive me--if you can.""",f
34485,"There was a long silence, then she said trying to speak steadily, ""You are not in the least to blame.",f

34487,For a moment they looked into each other's eyes.,f

34489,"""Would--would you go away to-day?"" she asked almost in a whisper; then with a brave little smile that went straight to his heart, she added: ""It's better, I think, to be quite alone.""",f
34490,"He made his simple preparations, and she helped him as best she could with trembling hands, but it was dark when he was ready to go.",f
34491,"Neither could frame the words they were wont to speak at parting, so they stood in silence, hand clasping hand.",f

34495,She stood as he had left her until the street door closed below.,f

34497,"Then, stretching out in the dark, her empty hands, she dropped on her knees beside the window.",f
34498,"Her shoulders shook with sobs, but there are no tears for such as she.",f
34499,She was far beyond the blessed flow which blinds some eyes to the reality of pain.,f
34500,"The inner depths, bare and quivering, are healed by no such balm as this.",f

34639,"How early did you get yours?""",f
34640,"""I--ah--yes--Gadski as Elizabeth--that is--rather early.",f
34641,"Yes, she was very fine,"" said George miserably.",f
34642,"The stunning revelation had come to him that on Tuesday night--the evening in which he had heard the carriage and the voices, Kitty had been to the opera with another man!",f
34643,And it seemed to fairly paralyse his powers of speech.,f
34644,"After a little while the guests politely departed, wondering what in the world was the matter with the Carsons.",f

34646,"""Looks like it,"" answered her husband concisely.",f
34647,Carson went up-stairs and searched the closet until he found the pinky-yellow gown with the black velvet bows.,f
34648,He sat down with the pretty fluffy thing in his hands.,f
34649,"A delicate odour of violets clung to it--Kitty always had violets around her--and the scent seemed like a haunting memory of a happy past, when he had a wife who wore soft womanly things--who loved to have him kiss her, and never went out nights.",f
34650,"With a sudden rush of tenderness he held the little gown close, but it yielded him no caress in return, and he flung it bitterly aside, feeling as he did so, that he sat among the ashes of a desolate and forsaken home.",f
34651,He grew white and worn in the days that followed.,f
34652,"He knew dimly what a grave might mean, since he felt the hurt of a living loss.",f
34653,He wandered through the lonely rooms evening after evening.,f
34654,"The sight of her dainty fluffy things made him suffer keenly, and a tiny jewelled slipper he found on the floor almost unmanned him.",f
34655,"He no longer went to the club, but sat at home among Kitty's things while she went out as usual.",f
34656,"One evening, after saying ""good-bye"" she caught her gown on a rocker, and turned back to free herself.",f
34657,"He was sitting before the fire, his elbow resting on his knee, and his chin in the palm of his hand.",f
34658,"It was a saddened face that Kitty saw, with all the joy and youth gone out of it.",f
34659,"The flickering light made the lines of pain very distinct, and her heart smote her at the realisation of what she had done.",f
34660,Quickly she ran up-stairs and took off her tailor-made costume.,f
34661,"When she came down, he was sitting as she had left him, unhearing, unseeing and unheeding.",f
34662,"As she came toward him, he looked up.",f
34663,"At the first sight of her in the pinky-yellow gown, he rubbed his eyes as if he had seen wrongly.",f
34664,"She came nearer to him, smiling, her hands outstretched, and he sprang to his feet.",f
34665,"""Kitty,"" he cried, ""are you going to stay at home to-night?""",f
34666,"""To-night, and always, dear, if you want me,"" she replied.",f
34667,"""Want you--Oh, my little wife!"" he said brokenly, and gathered her into his arms.",f
34668,"They had a long talk after that, and Kitty explained that she had been spending her evenings with Helen Everett, who was writing a book, and reading it to her, chapter by chapter as it was finished.",f
34669,"""Who is Johnnie?"" demanded George abruptly.",f
34670,"""Helen's brother.",f
34671,"He's only a boy, but he's a very nice one, and he takes us to all sorts of lovely places.""",f
34672,"After a moment she continued wistfully: ""Helen's awfully clever--books, colleges, degrees, and everything.""",f
34673,"""And you have only me,"" said George, laughing, and drawing her closer.",f
34674,"""You're enough, if I can only keep you,"" she returned mischievously.",f
34675,His face grew very grave.,f
34676,"""I have been a thoughtless brute, sweetheart.",f
34677,"Forgive me,"" he said kissing her fondly.",f
34678,"""And know all men by these presents, I hereby confer upon you the degree of Mistress of Arts.""",f

34683,"The predatory lady from Memphis, clad resplendently in white lace, and paste jewels, moved restlessly about the room.",f
34684,Her blue eyes were cat-like in their quick intense scrutiny.,f
34685,"They said, at the St.",f
34686,"James, that nothing under the roof escaped her knowledge.",f
34687,"Designedly she passed the two who sat at a glass-covered table in a secluded corner, affecting not to notice them.",f
34688,"When the rustle of her garments and the clatter of her high heels died away, the man spoke.",f
34689,"""She must have spilled the peroxide,"" he said with a grating laugh.",f
34690,Her hair was indeed more brilliant than usual.,f
34691,The woman laughed too--a little hysterical laugh which sounded more like a sob.,f
34692,"She took her watch from the silver bag that hung at her belt, opened it, and laid it before them.",f
34693,"""An hour more,"" she answered irrelevantly.",f
34694,"""Like Cinderella, I must go at twelve.""",f
34695,"""Are you afraid your auto will turn into a pumpkin drawn by white rats and your chauffeur into--let's see, who was Cinderella's footman?""",f
34696,She shook her head.,f

34698,"""You're only a child now,"" he returned quickly.",f
34699,"""No, I'm a woman, and I must meet whatever comes to me as a brave woman should.""",f

34705,She followed him through the French window.,f
34706,"Their two chairs were in their own particular corner still, placed as they had been every night for a week.",f
34707,"He arranged the rose and green velvet cushion at her back precisely as she liked it, and drew his own chair near hers--just close enough not to touch.",f

34971,"My little girl was lonesome without me.""",f
34972,The Roses and the Song     The Roses and the Song   There had been a lover's quarrel and she had given him back his ring.,f

34974,"Her face flushed, whether in anger or pain he did not know, but she made no reply.",f
34975,And he left her exulting in the thought that the old love was dead.,f
34976,"As the days went by, he began to miss her.",f
34977,"First, when his chum died in a far-off country, with no friend near.",f
34978,"He remembered with a pang how sweetly comforting she had always been, never asking questions, but soothing his irritation and trouble with her gentle womanly sympathy.",f
34979,He knew just what she would do if he could tell her that Tom was dead.,f
34980,"She would put her soft cheek against his own rough one, and say: ""I am so sorry dear.",f

34982,"""Not even death""--yes, it was quite true.",f
34983,Death changes nothing.--It is only life that separates utterly.,f
34984,"He began to miss the afternoon walks, the lingering in book store and art galleries, and the quiet evenings at home over the blazing fire, when he sat with his arm around her and told her how he had spent the time since they last met.",f
34985,"Every thought was in some way of her, and the emptiness of his heart without her seemed strange in connection with the fact that the old love was dead.",f
34986,"He saw by a morning paper that there was to be a concert for the benefit of some charitable institution, and on the program, printed beneath the announcement, was her name.",f
34987,He smiled grimly.,f
34988,How often he had gone with her when she sang in public!,f
34989,He remembered every little detail of every evening.,f
34990,"He always waited behind the scenes, because she said she could sing better when he was near her.",f
34991,"And whatever the critics might say, she was sure of his praise.",f
34992,It was on the way home from one of these affairs that he had first told her that he loved her.,f
34993,"Through the rose-leaf rain that fell from her hair and bosom at his touch he had kissed her for the first time, and the thrill of her sweet lips was with him still.",f
34994,How short the ride had been that night and why was the coachman in such an unreasonable hurry to get home?,f
34995,"He made up his mind that he would not go to the concert that night, but somehow, he bought a ticket and was there before the doors opened.",f
34996,So he went out to walk around a little.,f
34997,People who went to concerts early were his especial detestation.,f
34998,In a florist's window he saw some unusually beautiful roses.,f
34999,"He had always sent her roses before, to match her gown, and it seemed queer not to buy them for her now.",f
35000,Perhaps he really ought to send her some to show her that he cherished no resentment.,f
35001,Anyone could send her flowers over the footlights.,f
35002,"The other men that she knew would undoubtedly remember her, and he didn't want to seem unfriendly.",f
35003,So he went in.,f
35004,"""Four dozen La France roses,"" he said, and the clerk speedily made the selection.",f
35005,"He took a card out of his pocket, and chewed the end of his pencil meditatively.",f
35006,"It was strange that he should have selected that particular kind, he thought.",f
35007,"That other night, after he had gone home, he had found a solitary pink petal clinging to his scarf-pin.",f
35008,He remembered with a flush of tenderness that it had come from one of the roses--his roses--on her breast.,f
35009,He had kissed it passionately and hidden it in a book--a little book which she had given him.,f
35010,"With memory came heartache, his empty life and her wounded love.",f
35011,"The words shaped themselves under his pencil:  ""You know what the roses mean.",f
35012,Will you wear one when you sing the second time?,f
35013,"Forgive me and love me again--my sweetheart.""",f
35014,"He tied the card himself into the centre of the bunch, so it was half hidden by the flowers.",f
35015,He gave them to the usher with a queer tremolo note in his voice.,f
35016,"""After her first number, understand?""",f
35017,"There was a piano solo, and then she appeared.",f
35018,"What she sang he did not know, but her deep contralto, holding heaven in its tones, he both knew and understood.",f
35019,She did not sing as well as usual.,f
35020,Her voice lacked warmth and sincerity and her intonation was faulty.,f
35021,The applause was loud but not spontaneous although many of her friends were there.,f
35022,His were the only flowers she received.,f
35023,"When she came out the second time, he looked at her anxiously, but there was never a sign of a rose.",f
35024,He sank down in his chair with a sigh and covered his face with his hand.,f
35025,This time she sang as only _she_ could sing.,f
35026,"Oh, that glorious contralto!",f
35027,"Suggestions of twilight and dawn, of suffering and joy, of love and its renunciation.",f
35028,There was no mistaking her success and the great house rang with plaudits from basement to roof.,f
35029,"He, only, was silent; praying in mute agony for a sign.",f
35030,"She willingly responded to the encore and a hush fell upon the audience with the first notes of Tosti's ""Good-Bye.""",f
35031,"""_Falling leaf, and fading tree._""  Oh, why should she sing that?",f
35032,"He writhed as if in bodily pain, but the beautiful voice went on and on.",f
35033,"""_Good-bye, summer, good-bye, good-bye!_""  How cruel she seemed!",f
35034,"Stately, imperious, yet womanly, she held her listeners spellbound, but every word cut into his heart like a knife.",f
35035,"""_All the to-morrows shall be as to-day._""  The tears came and his lips grew white.",f
35036,"Then some way into the cruel magnificence of her voice came a hint of pity as she sang:    ""_Good-bye to hope, good-bye, good-bye!_""  There was a hush, then she began again:    ""_What are we waiting for, Oh, my heart?",f
35037,"Kiss me straight on the brows, and part!_""  All the love in her soul surged into her song; the joy of happy love; the agony of despairing love; the pleading cry of doubting love; the dull suffering of hopeless love; and then her whole strength was merged into a passionate prayer for the lost love, as she sang the last words:    ""_Good-bye forever, good-bye forever!",f
35038,"Good-bye, good-bye, good--bye--!_""  She bowed her acknowledgments again and again, and when the clamour was over, he hastened into the little room behind the stage where she was putting on her wraps.",f
35039,She was alone but her carriage was waiting.,f
35040,"As he entered, she started in surprise, then held out her hand.",f
35041,"""Dear,"" he said, ""if this is the end, won't you let me kiss you _once_ for the sake of our old happiness?",f
35042,"We were so much to each other--you and I. Even if you wouldn't wear the rose, won't you let me hold you just a minute as I used to do?""",f
35043,"""Wear the rose,"" she repeated, ""what do you mean?""",f
35044,"""Didn't you see my card?""",f
35045,"""No,"" she answered, ""I couldn't look at them--they are--La--France--you know--and----""  She reached out trembling fingers and found the card.",f
35046,"She read the tender message twice--the little message which meant so much, then looked up into his face.",f
35047,"""If I could,"" she whispered, ""I'd pin them all on.""",f
35048,"Someway she slipped into her rightful place again, and very little was said as they rolled home.",f
35049,"But when he lit the gas in his own room he saw something queer in the mirror, and found, clinging to his scarf-pin, the petal of a La France rose.",f
35050,"A Laggard in Love     A Laggard in Love   ""My dear,"" said Edith judiciously, ""I think you're doing wrong.""",f
35051,Marian dabbed her eyes with a very wet handkerchief and said nothing.,f
35052,Edith adjusted the folds of her morning gown and assumed a more comfortable position on the couch.,f
35053,"""They all have to be managed,"" she went on, ""and you'll find that Mr. Thomas Drayton is no exception.",f
35054,"I'll venture that when he makes his visits, which are like those of angels, 'few and far between' you tell him how lonesome you've been without him, and how you've thought of him every minute since the last time, and perhaps even cry a little bit!",f
35055,"Am I right?""",f
35056,Marian nodded.,f
35057,"""If it wasn't for that hateful Perkins girl, I wouldn't care so much.",f
35058,"She's neither bright nor pretty, and I'm sure I don't see what Tom sees in her.",f
35059,"I think it's more her fault than his.""",f
35060,"""The Perkins girl is entirely blameless, Miss Reynolds, though she certainly is unpleasant.",f
35061,"It is Tom's fault.""",f
35062,The afflicted Miss Reynolds wiped her eyes again.,f
35063,"""Perhaps it's mine.",f
35064,"If I were quite what I ought to be, Tom wouldn't seek other society, I'm sure.""",f
35065,Mrs. Bently sat up straight.,f
35066,"""Marian Reynolds,"" she demanded, ""have you ever said anything like that to Tom?""",f
35067,"""Something like that,"" Marian admitted.",f
35068,"""What should I have done?""",f
35069,"""Thrown a book at him,"" responded Mrs. Bently energetically.",f
35070,"Then she leaned back among the pillows, and twisted the corners of her handkerchief.",f
35071,"""Don't be horrid, Edith, but tell me what to do,"" pleaded Marian.",f
35072,Mrs. Bently looked straight out of the window.,f
35073,"""I've been married nearly ten years,"" she said meditatively, ""and I point with pardonable pride to my husband.",f
35074,There hasn't been any of the 'other woman business' since the first days of our engagement.,f
35075,"He never forgets the little words of endearment, he brings me flowers, and books, and he's quite as polite to me as he is to other women.""",f
35076,"""I know,"" replied Marian.",f
35077,"""I've seen him break away from a crowd in the middle of a sentence to put your rubbers on for you.""",f
35078,"""All that,"" resumed Edith, ""is the result of careful training.",f
35079,And what Tom needs is heroic treatment.,f
35080,"If you will promise to do exactly as I say, you will have his entire devotion inside of a month.""",f
35081,"""I promise,"" responded Marian hopefully.",f
35082,"""First, then, take off your engagement ring.""",f
35083,"Marian's pretty brown head drooped lower and lower, and a brighter diamond fell into her lap.",f
35084,"She felt again the passionate tenderness in his voice when he told her how much he loved her, and she remembered how he had kissed each finger-tip separately, then the diamond, just because it was hers.",f
35085,She looked at her friend with eyes full of tears.,f
35086,"""Edith, I can't.""",f
35087,"""Take it off.""",f
35088,"Marian obeyed, very slowly, then threw herself at the side of the couch sobbing.",f

35139,"""Never far away from you, dear,"" she answered and waved her hand to him as the crowd swept them apart.",f
35140,"""You're going to stay all night with me, you know,"" Edith said.",f

35194,"He had of course noticed the roses on the table, and he was very sure they had not been in Marian's room.",f
35195,"Once she had told him, how she had slept with one of the roses next her heart, and a thorn had pricked the flesh, making a red spot on a white petal.",f
35196,She showed him the rose with its tiny blood stain.,f
35197,He had kissed the flower and put it in a little memorandum book with a gold clasp.,f
35198,"And he had told Marian, over and over again, what a horrid rose it was--to hurt his sweetheart.",f
35199,"He smiled grimly at his own previous foolishness, and felt sure that none of the American Beauties would rest next to Marian's heart that night.",f
35200,Miss Reynolds and Mrs. Bently sat in the latter's boudoir.,f
35201,"Edith nodded sagely over Tom's note, and Marian was curled up in a forlorn heap on the couch.",f
35202,"""How does he usually begin his notes to you?""",f
35203,"""'My Dearest Girl,' or 'Dear Sweetheart,'"" answered Marian.",f
35204,"""H'm!",f
35205,"Well, my dear, you may depend upon it, he is 'beginning to take notice.'""  Sunday, Tom spent morosely at his club, and was so disagreeable that his friends were very willing to give him a wide berth.",f
35206,"Marian was neither cheerful nor happy, and wept copiously in private, fancying Tom worshipping at the shrine of Miss Perkins.",f
35207,Monday evening she and Edith dressed together.,f
35208,"Marian had a new gown of that peculiar shade of blue which seems to be especially made for brown eyes and hair, and looked, as her friend told her, ""simply stunning.""",f
35209,"""Joe has a box at the theatre to-night.",f
35210,"Isn't he lovely?""",f
35211,"Marian assented, but inwardly hoped that Tom would not hear of her being there.",f
35212,"Mr. Sterling Jackson was a very pleasant fellow, with an inexhaustible fund of humour.",f
35213,He devoted himself to Marian and looked unutterable things whenever opportunity offered.,f
35214,"Handsome, he certainly was, and she was secretly flattered by his evident adoration.",f
35215,Tom didn't matter quite so much now.,f
35216,At the theatre Marian sat in the front of an upper box beside Mrs. Bently.,f
35217,The devoted Jackson leaned forward and talked to her in subdued tones.,f
35218,"After the first act, Edith whispered to her:  ""Don't look, nor turn pale, nor do anything rash, but Mr. Thomas Drayton is down in the parquet with Miss Matilda Perkins.""",f
35219,Marian turned white and grasped the rail of the box.,f
35220,"""Don't faint till I tell you.",f
35221,"He hasn't taken his eyes off you since he first saw you, and I don't believe he has seen the stage at all.",f
35222,"Perkins is simply green with rage, and I wish you could see her hat.",f
35223,"It's a dream in pink and yellow--an equine dream.""",f
35224,"Marian's colour returned, and conscious of looking her best, she flirted outrageously with the ever willing Jackson, though she confided to Edith at the end of the second act, that she was ""perfectly wretched.""",f
35225,"""Nobody suspects it,"" returned Mrs. Bently, ""least of all Tom.",f
35226,"He's chewing Perkins's fan, and she's trying to draw him out.""",f
35227,For the remainder of the week Mr. Drayton studiously avoided the Reynolds mansion.,f
35228,"Marian had been seen on the Boulevard with the odious Jackson, and Miss Perkins had suddenly lost her charm.",f
35229,Marian was always at home on Tuesdays.,f
35230,"Next week he would drop in, in the afternoon, and see how the land lay.",f
35231,"Mrs. Bently had heard, through her husband, that Drayton had gone out of the city, and the intelligence was promptly conveyed to Marian.",f
35232,The solitaire lay in a corner of Marian's chatelaine bag.,f
35233,"She meditated the propriety of sending it back, but Edith would not hear of it.",f
35234,"Her heart ached constantly for Tom, and she flirted feverishly with Jackson.",f
35235,"""I am at home Tuesdays,"" she said one evening when he left her.",f
35236,"""Come in for a little while and I will give you a cup of tea.""",f
35237,He came early and found her alone.,f
35238,"They chatted for a few minutes, and then Mr. Thomas Drayton was announced.",f
35239,"The two men were civil to each other, but Marian felt their mutual irritation, and was relieved when Jackson rose to take his departure.",f
35240,He crossed the room to Tom and shook hands.,f
35241,"""I am very glad to have met you, Mr. Drayton.",f
35242,"I am sure we shall meet often, if you find Miss Reynolds as charming as I do.""",f
35243,He bowed politely to Marian and went out.,f
35244,"""The insufferable cad!"" thought Tom.",f
35245,"He shivered, and Marian hastened to the tea table.",f
35246,"""It's awfully cold outside,"" she said, ""and these rooms are not any too warm.",f
35247,I'll make you some tea.,f
35248,"You take two lumps of sugar, don't you?""",f
35249,Tom said nothing.,f
35250,"Marian's pretty hands hovered over the teacups, and he noticed that the left one was ringless.",f
35251,"""Don't you wear your solitaire any more, Marian?""",f
35252,His voice was strange and she was half afraid.,f
35253,"""Oh, yes,"" she responded brightly, ""sometimes.",f
35254,"The points of the setting catch in my glove though, and I am afraid of loosening the stone.""",f
35255,"""Marian, don't you care for me?""",f
35256,"""Certainly.""",f
35257,"""How much?""",f
35258,"""As much as you care for me, I think, don't you?""",f
35259,He went over and put his arm around her.,f
35260,"She shrank a little at his touch, but he pulled her down on the sofa beside him.",f
35261,"""Marian, darling, tell me what the matter is.",f
35262,"I know I don't deserve you, and I'll go, if you say I must.",f
35263,"Has that fellow Jackson come between us?""",f
35264,Marian disregarded one of Edith's injunctions.,f
35265,"""Perhaps it's Miss Perkins.""",f
35266,"Tom said a very emphatic swear word, which does not look well in print, then buried his head in one of the sofa cushions.",f
35267,"She was frightened and sank down on her knees beside him, her armor of self-defence vanishing in womanly pity.",f
35268,"""Tom, dear Tom!",f
35269,What is it?,f
35270,"Tell me!""",f
35271,He straightened up and lifted her to the sofa beside him.,f
35272,"""I see, sweetheart, I've been a fool and a great deal worse than that.",f
35273,"Can you ever forgive me?""",f
35274,"""One thing first, Tom, do you love me?""",f
35275,"""Marian, dear, I never knew until this last wretched week, just how much you meant to me.",f
35276,"I am yours, body and soul, to do with what you will.",f
35277,"I have no right to insult you, Marian, but will you take me back?""",f
35278,"His voice trembled with the agony of love and pain, as she drew the solitaire out of the chatelaine bag at her belt.",f
35279,She held it silently toward him.,f
35280,"""Darling, is it good-bye?""",f
35281,"""No, dear, I want you to put it back.""",f
35282,"And that evening, in accordance with instructions, the servant said to Mr. Sterling Jackson, ""Miss Reynolds is out.""",f
35283,He stood at the side of the brilliantly lighted opera-house with a note-book and pencil in his hand.,f
35284,Would that interminable symphony never be finished?,f
35285,"The audience listened breathlessly, but he, the musical critic of a thriving daily paper, only drummed idly with his fingers and stared vacantly at the people near him.",f
35286,"There was a momentary hush, the orchestra leader waved his baton, and the trained musicians, with perfect precision began the brilliant _finale_.",f
35287,"The audience was unusually sympathetic, and for an instant after the closing passage all was still; then came a great burst of applause.",f
35288,"The leader bowed his acknowledgment, but the clamour only increased.",f
35289,The critic sank wearily into an empty seat and looked across the house.,f
35290,"He started and grew pale, as among the throng of fashionables he saw a face that he knew--that he had known.",f
35291,"A sweet face it was too; not beautiful, but full of subtle charm and a haunting tenderness that he had tried to forget.",f
35292,"He sat like one in a dream, and did not know that the orchestra was about to play the next number till its opening measures woke him from his abstraction.",f

35298,"Down below on the rocks was the far-off sound of the sea, and she, with his roses on her breast, sat before the piano and played dreamily, tenderly, yes, this same Tr䵭erei that was now breaking his heart.",f
35299,"He had stood behind her, with his arms around her, his dark, eager face down close to hers, and whispered huskily: ""Sweetheart, I love you.""",f
35300,"And she had turned her face up to his and said, softly, ""I love--you--too--dear;"" and he had hugged her tightly to him and covered her face with burning kisses that were almost pain.",f
35301,And--that--had--been--their--betrothal.,f
35302,"Then for a little while there was happiness--then there was a misunderstanding--and there--she was--and----  Up through those arches of light the clear, sweet melody stole.",f
35303,Had he forgotten?,f
35304,Had she?,f
35305,He seized his opera-glass and a quick turn of the screw brought her again close to him.,f
35306,"Yes, there were tears in her eyes; he could see the white lids quiver, and her lips trembled and----  With a deeper throb of pain than any he yet had known, the buried love came back, strong and sweet, as in those dear days when the whole world seemed aglow with love of her.",f
35307,He rose and walked nervously around the shining circle and down the aisle to where she sat.,f
35308,"His breath came quick and fast, he hardly dared trust himself to speak, but with a great effort he commanded himself and bent over her chair.",f
35309,She looked up and her tear-wet eyes met his own.,f
35310,"He whispered, hoarsely, ""Forgive me--come out a minute--I want to speak to you.""",f
35311,"Hardly knowing what she did, she followed him into the dimly lighted, deserted foyer.",f
35312,"[Illustration]  With the last strain of that wordless love-sweet song, the dear old dream came back and, unrebuked, he put his arm about her once more.",f

35420,"Occasionally, one of the workmen would pat him on the head, and he distinctly remembered one day when the lady next door, gave him a piece of candy.",f
35421,"Before he and his mother came to live in the little shop, he had never seen a violin, and even now he could not be said to have heard one, for neither his father nor any of the workmen knew how to play;--they were quite content with putting the bridge in place, leaving the strings to be adjusted in the neighbouring town where the instruments found a ready sale.",f
35422,"One day, the last touch was given to an unusually fine instrument, and in a moment of pride, the old man fitted it with strings.",f
35423,He placed it under his chin and touched the strings softly with the bow.,f
35424,"Faulty though the touch was, the answer was melody--a long sweet chord.",f
35425,"Pedro's eyes grew darker, and his little face was fearlessly upturned to the man who held the singer of that wonderful song.",f

35430,"Pale and frightened, he sank into a corner, but the memory of the sweetness was with him still and in his soul was the dawn of unspeakable light.",f
35431,"All was silent in the shop now, but shortly he heard the busy hum of voices and the old confused sound.",f
35432,"Then above the din, the violin sounded again.",f
35433,He listened in wonder.,f
35434,"That single chord had been a revelation, and as a sculptor sees in a formless stone the future realisation of a marble dream, so Pedro, guided unerringly by that faulty strain, saw through break and discord, the promise of a symphony.",f
35435,"He fell asleep that night haunted still by that strange sweet sound, and dreamed that it had been his fingers to which the strings had answered.",f

35450,Through his childish fancy flitted a dream of a symphony--the unthought melody which might be sleeping in those broken chords.,f
35451,"He delivered his message safely, and the man kindly showed him a short cut home.",f
35452,"It was very late, and the streets were still, but he was not afraid.",f
35453,"He passed house after house that was gayly lighted, and looked longingly at the revelry within, but he hurried onward till he came to a little house in a side street.",f
35454,Hark!,f
35455,He stopped suddenly.,f
35456,Out of the darkness came the sound of music--was it a violin?,f
35457,"Yes, no, it could not be.",f
35458,He crept closer to the cottage.,f
35459,"Then a burst of harmony came into his consciousness--long, sweet, silvery notes; a glad rush of sound that brought tears to his eyes--a delicate half hushed whisper, and then the twinkle of a brook, with the twilight gentleness of a shadow.",f
35460,"Clearer and stronger the music grew, and the child's breath came in quick, short gasps.",f
35461,"The brook was a river now, he could hear the swaying of the trees in the forest; the heart of the wind was in the music, and on it swept in glad resistless cadence, from the brook to the river, then down to the sea.",f
35462,"A pause, a long low note, then a glorious vision of blue, as into the rush of the song, there came the sweet, unutterable harmonies of the ocean.",f
35463,He was in ecstasy; he scarcely dared to move.,f
35464,"Oh, could he but see whence the music came!",f
35465,"Could he look for a moment only, upon the face of the master!",f
35466,"The moon came out from behind a cloud, and the child looked up.",f
35467,"At the open window he saw an old man with deep-set eyes, a kindly smile, and long white hair that hung down to his shoulders.",f
35468,"He held a violin in his hand, but the picture needed not this touch to tell the child who it was that had made this wonderful music, for he felt that he now looked upon the face of the master.",f
35469,"With a sigh, the old man again placed the instrument in position, and drew the bow across the strings.",f
35470,The boy trembled.,f
35471,"In slow, measured sweetness the music came--a deep wonderful harmony that held him spellbound.",f
35472,"There was a tender cadence that swayed the player's soul, and into the theme crept the passionate pain of one who had loved and lost.",f
35473,The child knew that the man was suffering--that music like that could only come from an aching heart.,f
35474,"With double notes, in a minor key, the master played on; then the violin slipped to the floor unheeded, and the old man laid his head on the window sill, and wept like a child.",f
35475,Pedro crept away; he could bear no more.,f
35476,The glory had entered into his soul.,f
35477,"He went noiselessly to bed, but he heard still that marvellous music and saw again the pain-shadowed face of the master.",f
35478,"Oh, could he but touch the magic strings!",f
35479,Could he but play one note of the wondrous song!,f
35480,An idea seized him--he would try sometime.,f
35481,"In a transport of joy he fell asleep, and dreamed all night long of the heavenly strains.",f
35482,"He saw the clear deep blue of the ocean, he heard the wind symphonies in the forest, and always, too, before him was that white suffering face.",f
35483,The next day he was scarcely himself.,f
35484,"He moved about as if he still slept, while his eyes were unusually sad and thoughtful.",f
35485,"At night he could not sleep, and after making sure that every one else was in deep slumber, he slipped quietly out into the shop.",f
35486,"The moon showed him where to go, and at length he picked up the new violin which had taken so long to finish, and which was the finest his father had ever made.",f
35487,Where should he go?,f
35488,"Outdoors, assuredly.",f
35489,He went softly out into the moonlight and down to the brook which was some distance from the house.,f
35490,"The silence, the beauty, the witchery of it all, was overwhelming.",f
35491,"A gentle breeze swayed the tree tops, and, from the instrument in his hand, drew forth Ưlian music.",f
35492,"He started, placed it in position, and drew the bow across the wind-swept strings.",f
35493,"His touch awakened the sleeping voice, and through his soul surged again the long, sweet chords that had made him glad, and shown him through the broken bits of melody, the grandeur of the symphony.",f
35494,"Tenderly, tremblingly, he touched the strings again, and another chord, a minor, struck deep into his heart.",f
35495,"Without thought or knowledge of the art he still blundered on, knowing naught save that it was _his_ fingers that made a wild, delirious, rapturous sound, and seeing only the remembered vision of the master's face.",f
35496,"Conscious of nothing else, he did not see that the sun had risen.",f
35497,Suddenly he looked up.,f
35498,His father stood before him with a strange expression on his face.,f
35499,"The terrified child dropped the instrument to ward off a blow, but the father said, with a tremor in his voice: ""Is it so, my boy?",f
35500,Are you then a musician?,f
35501,You shall have lessons;,f
35502,I shall give you a violin; we go to-day to see the master.,f
35503,"Ah, the music!",f
35504,"It is most wonderful!""",f
35505,The boy was dumb with astonishment.,f
35506,To learn?,f
35507,And who was the master?,f
35508,"That afternoon he dressed himself in his best garments, which were worn only on festal occasions, and with his father went on the gladdest errand of his life.",f
35509,The master!,f
35510,Could it be?,f
35511,The child's heart almost stopped beating.,f
35512,"Yes, down the little street they turned and went up to the door of the cottage.",f
35513,He could not speak.,f
35514,"Presently he found himself in a plainly furnished little room, and heard footsteps in the hall.",f
35515,"The door opened, and Pedro looked up to see those deep-set eyes that seemed to smile down at him.",f
35516,"The father rose, and bowing low, he said: ""Signor, I would like my son to play the violin--you are a teacher--he will be a musician.",f
35517,"I have no money, Signor, but if you teach my boy how to play, I will make you a violin--the finest in the world.""",f
35518,"The master was about to refuse; his old violin was a good one, and he did not like to teach.",f
35519,"He turned away hastily, but he caught a glimpse of the child's uplifted face.",f
35520,"His soul was in his eyes, and in their depths the great artist saw an unutterable longing.",f
35521,He was touched.,f
35522,"""Child,"" he said, ""would you like to play?""",f
35523,He laid his hand on the boy's shoulder.,f
35524,The touch and the kindly tone thrilled him unspeakably.,f
35525,To play?,f
35526,To hear again that infinite music?,f
35527,Glad tears rushed to his eyes and his only answer was a sob.,f
35528,"""Ah, yes,"" the man's voice was tender.",f
35529,"""You love it;",f
35530,I will teach you.,f
35531,"Come to-morrow at this hour and we shall begin.""",f
35532,"Pedro went home, wild with delight.",f
35533,To play!,f
35534,To see the master's face!,f
35535,"Ah, it was too much!",f
35536,"All night long he dreamed of that delicious melody, and the dear old head with its crown of silver hair that seemed like a benediction.",f
35537,His father gave him a little old violin.,f
35538,To him?,f
35539,Was it all his own?,f
35540,"""And when you can play, my boy,"" he said, ""you shall have the 'Beauty'.""",f
35541,Pedro's first lessons were a revelation.,f
35542,"His face was a study for a painter, and the teacher saw that he had before him the promise of an artist.",f
35543,He gave himself willingly to the task and soon learned to dearly love his eager pupil.,f
35544,And Pedro?,f
35545,"No task was too hard, no study too difficult, no practice too long and tedious, if he might please his good old friend; and even while he struggled with the difficulties of technique, he never lost hope or patience, for before him always like a guiding star, was the serene white face of the master.",f
35546,"So the years went by, and all Italy was being searched for the finest wood that grew--for the sharpest tools.",f
35547,"The wood for the master's violin must be well seasoned--it would take a long time--the longer, the better.",f
35548,"For centuries the old tree had listened to wind, and river, and bird; the sounds of the forest were interwoven with its fibre, and now it must give up its buried music in answer to the strings of the violin.",f
35549,"The childish stature was changed to that of manhood, and still the teacher found in Pedro a devoted pupil.",f
35550,"The youth had developed in many ways, but the artist seemed to be little changed.",f
35551,"A little more bent, perhaps, but the same sweet soul.",f
35552,"Pedro had the ""Beauty"" but the master's violin was not yet finished.",f
35553,"He never asked for it, never spoke of it; in the delight of Pedro's achievement and greater promise, perhaps he had forgotten the promise of the old violin maker.",f
35554,But the old man was growing feeble.,f
35555,A change was coming and the young man felt it too.,f
35556,"He went one day for his lesson, and the housekeeper met him at the door with her finger on her lip.",f
35557,Hush!,f
35558,The teacher was ill.,f
35559,But he would like to see Pedro for a few minutes.,f
35560,"He went in and spoke tenderly to the old friend, whose eyes shone with so much love for his pupil--his boy--as he still called him.",f
35561,"Pedro could not stay long--it was too sad, and the tears were choking his utterance.",f
35562,He went home with a sorrow-laden heart.,f
35563,"His father said to him as he entered: ""The master's violin is at last finished, my son.",f
35564,"See?""",f
35565,He held up a beautifully fashioned instrument.,f
35566,"""You shall take it to him to-morrow.",f
35567,"Ah, its tone!",f
35568,"You will play?""",f
35569,"""No, father, I cannot.",f
35570,"The master, he is ill--dying--perhaps.",f
35571,Oh!,f
35572,"I cannot.""",f
35573,The old violin maker laid the instrument gently in its case.,f
35574,"There were tears in his own eyes--""The teacher!",f
35575,"Well, we must all die,"" and he turned to his work.",f
35576,"Night came, and Pedro tossed restlessly on his couch.",f
35577,About midnight there was a rap on the front door of the shop.,f
35578,He went quietly and opened it.,f
35579,There was a messenger from the old housekeeper.,f
35580,The teacher was sinking fast.,f
35581,The physician said he could not last until morning.,f
35582,"He was out of pain, and he knew the end was near.",f
35583,Would Pedro come and play for him?,f
35584,The night seemed so long!,f
35585,Pedro dressed himself hurriedly.,f
35586,"Oh, if he should be too late!",f
35587,As he went through the shop he passed the table where lay the master's violin.,f
35588,A sob came into his throat as he lifted it from the case.,f
35589,He would play that.,f
35590,Out into the still street he went with almost breathless haste.,f
35591,"The moon shone gloriously, and the air was sweet with spring.",f
35592,"He reached the cottage and went softly into the little room at the end of the hall where the man lay, looking like a piece of marble statuary, but still breathing.",f
35593,Pedro bent over him and looked lovingly into his face.,f
35594,"The master spoke with difficulty--""You are come, then, my friend--my boy?""",f
35595,The same old tenderness!,f
35596,Pedro could not answer.,f
35597,"""You will play to me?",f
35598,"The end is so near, the night seems so long--play to me, my boy.""",f
35599,"The feeble man turned his face to the open window, which was on a level with his couch.",f
35600,"With a sigh of content, he laid his head upon the sill.",f
35601,Pedro started.,f
35602,"The position, the moonlight, oh, that far-off night!",f
35603,"Again he was a child crouching in the darkness, and in the old ecstasy beneath that very window--he heard again that infinitely sad music, and saw again the white suffering face.",f
35604,"He placed the instrument in position; step by step, unerringly, he followed the notes of the marvellous melody, for was not the musician before him, teaching him how to play it?",f
35605,The grey head turned towards the player--a strange new light in his eyes.,f
35606,"But seeing only the vision of his childhood the young man played on and on, and somehow into the symphony crept all the love and sadness of a life time.",f
35607,As he played he threw his whole soul into the music.,f
35608,"Oh, the indescribable sweetness of the master's violin!",f
35609,"At last his vision faded, and he saw the massive head drop on the same old sill--he heard once more the sobs that come with tears.",f
35610,"The music ended with a broken chord, and he looked up--to find his friend gazing at him with ineffable happiness.",f
35611,"""My boy, where did you learn that?",f
35612,"It is one of my own compositions--I have never written it all down--where--where did you learn it?""",f
35613,"Pedro drew his chair to the couch, and, clasping the withered hand in both his own that were strong and young, and beating with life, he told the story.",f
35614,"So long ago that he was but a child, he had heard the artist play it.",f
35615,"He had known even then that it was born of sorrow, and to-night that far-off time came back into the moonlight, with the master's face.",f
35616,"He had not played from memory only, for the teacher had shown him some of the notes and he had but followed.",f
35617,"The man feebly raised his head and said brokenly: ""My boy, you are right;",f
35618,I had a sorrow.,f
35619,"You are young, but you will understand.""",f
35620,"No longer master and pupil, they were now friend and friend.",f
35621,"""I loved her--the best of all the world.",f
35622,"But with the end only, came the peace which had been denied me in life.",f
35623,She loved my music and I played to her when she lay dying.,f
35624,"She did not love me as I loved her--I was her friend, always;",f
35625,"'her dear, dear friend,' she used to say.",f
35626,"""But,"" and the voice grew stronger, ""my arms were around her when the angels came--with my kisses on her lips she went to her grave--there are violets there--she loved them so--for thirty years I have watched them.",f
35627,"Her heart has blossomed into them, and they come from her to me.",f
35628,"""She was so pure--so sweet--and her last word was for me.",f
35629,Such a little word!,f
35630,"With her last strength, she put her arms around me, and drew my face down to hers--such a little word--it was a whisper--_Sweetheart_!",f
35631,She loved me then--I know she did.,f
35632,"Oh, love, could I break the bonds of the grave!""",f
35633,He was silent for a moment.,f
35634,"""Now you know--you understand.",f
35635,"You will play it again.""",f
35636,The night was deepening toward the dawn.,f
35637,"Once more Pedro took the violin--and played the melody, instinct with the old, old story of love and pain.",f
35638,The man's eyes were closed; he lay contentedly and peacefully as a child.,f
35639,"As the boy played, the darkness waned, and as he finished, not with a broken chord, but with a minor that some way seemed completion, the first faint lines of light came into the eastern sky.",f
35640,"The master turned to the window again: ""See, the day breaks.""",f
35641,"The sky grew gold and crimson, but a more celestial light seemed to live around the grey head, as if, in rifts of heaven, he saw her waiting for him.",f
35642,"He stretched his trembling hands to the east, and whispered: ""Yes, I am coming!",f
35643,Coming!,f
35644,You love me then?,f
35645,"Ah, yes!",f
35646,Beyond the sunset--the dawn;,f
35647,"I am coming--coming--coming--such a little word--_Sweetheart_!""",f
35648,A look of unspeakable rapture; it was transfiguration; then the deep blue eyes were closed upon the scenes of earth.,f
35649,The first ray of the sun shot into the little room and rested with loving touch upon the couch.,f
35650,"The sobbing old housekeeper came toward them, but Pedro motioned her away.",f
35651,"He knelt at the bedside, his own face shining with something of that celestial glow, and man though he was, with quivering lips he kissed again and again the dear white face of the master.",f
35652,"A Reasonable Courtship     A Reasonable Courtship   When Tom Elliott graduated from Harvard, that power of the mind which is known as reason had become a fetish with him.",f
35653,"Every human action, he argued, should be controlled by it.",f
35654,"The majority of people were largely influenced by their feelings; he, Thomas Elliott, twenty-six, good-looking, and fairly wealthy, would turn his mental advantages to good account and be guided wholly by his reason.",f
35655,He explained his theory to an attractive young woman who had gone out on the veranda with him.,f
35656,"Partly because her mind was too much occupied with the speaker to comprehend the full purport of his remarks, and partly because her feminine tact forbade opposition to an unimportant thing, Miss Marshall nodded her pretty head in entire assent.",f
35657,"""It is an assured fact,"" he went on, ""that all the unhappiness in the world is caused by the inability to reason.",f
35658,Married life is miserable just because it is not put on a sensible basis.,f
35659,"Any two human beings capable of reasoning would be happy together, if that point were kept constantly in view.",f
35660,"Perfect, absolute truthfulness, and constant deductions from it, form the only sure foundation for happiness.",f
35661,"Am I right?""",f
35662,She twisted the corners of her handkerchief.,f
35663,"""Yes, I think you are.""",f
35664,Elliott paced back and forth with his hands in his pockets--a symptom of nervousness which women mistake for deep thought;,f
35665,"""Belle,"" he said suddenly, ""I have always liked you.",f
35666,You have so much more sense than most girls.,f
35667,"I am not going to flatter you, but you are the only woman I ever saw who seemed to be a reasonable being.",f
35668,"What I want to ask is, will you try it with me?""",f
35669,Miss Marshall opened her brown eyes in amazement.,f
35670,"Since she left boarding-school, the approach of the Elliott planet had materially confused her orbit.",f
35671,"She had often dreamed of the offer of Tom's heart and hand, but for once, the consensus of masculine opinion to the contrary, a woman was surprised by a proposal.",f
35672,"""What on earth do you mean?"" she gasped.",f
35673,"""Just this.",f
35674,"You and I are congenial, of an equal station in life, and I believe we could be happy together--happier than the average married couple.",f
35675,"There's no foolish sentimentality about it; we know each other, and that is enough.""",f
35676,There was a terrific thumping going on in the region where Miss Marshall had mentally located her heart.,f
35677,She took refuge in that platitude of her sex which goads an ordinary lover to desperation.,f
35678,"""This is so sudden, Mr. Elliott!",f
35679,"I must take time to consider.""",f
35680,"""Very well, take your own time.",f
35681,"I'll be a good husband to you, Belle, if you'll only give me the chance.""",f
35682,"In the solitude of her ""den"" Belle Marshall gave the matter serious consideration.",f
35683,"Safely intrenched behind a formal proposal, she admitted to herself that she loved him--a confession that no woman ever should make until the Rubicon has been crossed.",f
35684,But even the most love-blinded damsel could not transfigure Elliott's demeanour into that of a lover.,f
35685,"Within her reach, in a secret drawer, was a pile of impassioned letters and a withered rose; on her desk a photograph of a handsome face, which she had last seen white to the lips with pain.",f
35686,"He had called her cruel, and she had smiled faintly at the Harvard pin which she wore, and bade him go.",f
35687,"Then there was another, of whom Belle did not like to think, though she went to his grave sometimes with a remorseful desire to make some sort of an atonement.",f
35688,He was only a boy--and some women know what it is to be loved by a boy.,f
35689,"She compared the pleading of the others with Elliott's business-like offer, and wondered at the severity of fate.",f
35690,"Then she wrote a note: ""Miss Marshall accepts with pleasure, Mr. Elliott's kind invitation to become his wife,"" and sent it by a messenger.",f
35691,"Before burning her relics, as an engaged girl should, she sat down to look them over once more.",f
35692,With a Spartan-like resolve she at last put every letter and keepsake into the sacrificial flames.,f
35693,"When it was over she sighed, for she had nothing left but memory and the business like promise of the morning: ""I'll be a good husband to you, Belle, if you'll only give me a chance.""",f
35694,"Her note would doubtless be answered in person, and she donned a pretty white gown, that she might not keep him waiting.",f
35695,She vainly tried to tone down her flushed cheeks with powder.,f
35696,"""You are a nice sort of girl,"" she said to herself, ""for a reasonable marriage.""",f
35697,"Just then the door-bell rang, and she flew to answer the summons.",f
35698,"There was no one else in the house, the coast was clear and she was an engaged girl.",f
35699,"She started in surprise, as Elliott walked solemnly on by her, after she had closed the door.",f
35700,"""Nice afternoon,"" he said.",f
35701,There was no doubt about it;,f
35702,Miss Marshall had expected to be kissed.,f
35703,"Still unable to speak, she followed him into the parlour.",f
35704,He turned to offer her a chair and instantly read her thought.,f
35705,"""You need fear nothing of the kind from me,"" he said in a blundering way, which men consider a high power of tact.",f
35706,"""It's not hygienic, and is a known cause of disease.",f
35707,"Above all things, let us be sensible.""",f
35708,"""You got my note?"" she enquired faintly.",f
35709,"""Yes, and I came to thank you for the honour conferred upon me.",f
35710,"I assure you, I fully appreciate it--more, perhaps, than I can make you understand.""",f
35711,"Throughout his call he was dignified and friendly, but she was in a state of nervous excitement which bordered on hysteria.",f
35712,"""You are nervous and overwrought,"" he said in a friendly way.",f
35713,"""Perhaps I would better go.",f
35714,"I'll come again soon, and you shall name the day, and we will make plans for our future.""",f
35715,"He shook hands in parting, and Belle ran up-stairs as if her life depended upon it.",f
35716,"Once in her own room, she locked the door, then threw herself down among her sofa pillows in a passion of tears.",f
35717,"""A--cause--of--_disease_--of--_disease_,"" she sobbed.",f

35719,"She had kept her lips for her husband, and the wound went deep.",f
35720,"When she descended the stairs, calm and collected, her eyes were set and resolute, and there was a look around her mouth that boded ill for Mr. Thomas Elliott, of Harvard, '94.",f
35721,The next day he asked her to drive.,f

35729,"Her eyes flashed, but she said nothing.",f
35730,"Offering him her handkerchief she commanded him to ""wipe off the powder,"" and Elliott did so, wondering in a half-frightened way, what the mischief was the matter with Belle.",f
35731,"They were early, and sauntered along the brilliantly lighted street, with plenty of time to look into the shop windows.",f
35732,One firm had filled its largest window with ties of a dashing red.,f

35749,Belle's stony silence at last penetrated Tom's understanding.,f
35750,"""There's no reason why I shouldn't take another girl to the theatre,"" he explained, ""just because I happen to be engaged to you.",f
35751,"It isn't announced yet, and won't be until you are willing.",f
35752,And you know it doesn't change my regard for you in the least to go with any one else.,f
35753,"You are welcome to the same freedom.""",f
35754,A great light broke in upon Belle.,f
35755,The next time he called she had gone to play tennis with a Yale man.,f
35756,"He saw them laughing and chatting a little way down the street, and the owner of the blue sweater was carrying her racket.",f
35757,"Tom was angry, for the Yale man was an insufferable cad, and she had no business to go with him.",f
35758,He would speak to her about it.,f
35759,"On the way home, he wisely decided to say nothing about it.",f
35760,"Perhaps Belle wasn't as fully accustomed to being guided by reason as he was, though she was an unusually sensible girl.",f
35761,He must be gentle with her at first; she would grow by degrees.,f
35762,"Acting on this impulse, he took his cherished copy of Spencer's _Ethics_ and presented it to her.",f
35763,"""You'll like this,"" he said, ""after you have got into it, and it will help you amazingly about reasoning.""",f
35764,A well-developed white arm threw the Spencer vigorously against the side of the house.,f
35765,"Elliott was surprised, for a woman like this was utterly outside the pale of his experience.",f
35766,Perhaps she didn't feel well.,f
35767,He put his arm around her.,f
35768,"""What is it, Belle?"" he asked anxiously.",f
35769,"The singular phenomena increased in intensity, for Belle jerked away from him, with her eyes blazing.",f
35770,"""How dare you touch me?"" she said, and walked like an empress out of the room.",f
35771,Inside of ten minutes the idea came to Elliott that she did not intend to return until he left the house.,f
35772,"Her handkerchief lay on the table, and he picked it up.",f
35773,"He looked carefully into the hall, and saw no one.",f
35774,"Then the apostle of reason put the handkerchief into his pocket and walked out of the room to the front door, then slowly down the street, still in a brown study.",f
35775,"""What could a young woman mean by such vigorous hints of displeasure?""",f
35776,"Four years at college had taught him nothing of women and their peculiar ways, and he was evidently on the wrong track.",f
35777,"It wasn't reasonable to humour her in such tantrums, but he sent a box of roses by way of a peace offering, and received in return a note which emboldened him to call.",f
35778,"An old-time friendly chat put them on an equal footing again, and Elliott grew confidential.",f
35779,"""Every thought of mine rightfully belongs to you, I suppose,"" he said one day.",f
35780,"""Every thought of mine _is_ of you,"" she replied softly, and he watched the colour in her cheeks with a sensation akin to pleasure.",f
35781,He thought about it in the night afterward.,f
35782,It was nice for a fellow to know that a girl like Belle thought of him often.,f
35783,"If it had been a proper thing to do, he wouldn't have minded kissing her when she said it, for he had never seen her look so pretty.",f
35784,The Yale man had gone back to college and Elliott settled down in business with his father.,f
35785,"He and Belle were the best of friends, and he looked forward with increasing pleasure to the day which she had not yet named.",f
35786,He planned a European tour which he was sure would both surprise and please her.,f
35787,He did not intend to mention it until after the ceremony.,f
35788,Surely no lover ever had a more reasonable and attractive path to travel.,f
35789,Belle was everything that could be desired.,f
35790,"When his visits were infrequent, she did not seem to miss him, and--rarest quality in woman!--never asked him any questions as to the way in which he had spent the time away from her.",f
35791,Tom felt like a pioneer who had emancipated his sex by applying the test of reason to every duty and pleasure in life.,f
35792,"The summer waned, and beside the open fire in the long cool evenings she seemed doubly attractive.",f
35793,"In a friendly way, he took her hand in his, as they sat in front of the flaming brushwood, then started in surprise.",f
35794,"""What is it?"" she asked.",f
35795,"""The queerest thing,"" Tom answered.",f
35796,"""When I touched your hand just now, I felt a funny little quiver run up that arm to my elbow.",f
35797,"Did you ever feel a thing like that?""",f
35798,Belle forsook the path of absolute truth.,f
35799,"""No, how queer!""",f
35800,"""Isn't it?""",f
35801,"He took her hand again, but the touch brought no answering thrill.",f
35802,"""Must have been my imagination, or a chill,"" commented Tom.",f
35803,"Alone in her room, Miss Marshall laughed softly to herself.",f
35804,"""Imagination, or a chill!",f
35805,"What a dear funny stupid thing a man is!""",f
35806,Sunday evenings Tom invariably spent with Belle.,f
35807,"When he called on the first evening of the following week, he was astonished to find that she had gone to church with the Yale man.",f
35808,"Mrs. Marshall explained to him that it was the young man's farewell visit; his mother had been ill and he had been unexpectedly called home, thus giving him a few days with old friends.",f
35809,"[Illustration: He saw them laughing and chatting a little way down the street, and the owner of the blue sweater was carrying her racket.",f
35810,"_From the Drawing by Dalton Stevens._]  ""Must be very ill,"" said Tom ironically, under his breath, as he went back to his cheerless room.",f
35811,There was a queer tightness somewhere in his chest which he had never felt before and it seemed to be connected in some way with the Yale man.,f
35812,"He slept fitfully and dreamed of Belle in a little house, with an open fire in the parlour, where he would be a welcome guest and the alumni of the other colleges would be denied admittance.",f
35813,"He was tempted to remonstrate with her, but had no reasonable ground for doing so.",f
35814,They would be married shortly and then the matter would end.,f
35815,"The next time he went to see her, the peculiar tightness appeared in his chest again, and he could hardly answer her cheerful greetings.",f
35816,"He noted that she had acquired a Yale pin, which flaunted its ugly blue upon her breast.",f
35817,He trembled violently as he sat down and drops of perspiration stood out on his brow.,f
35818,She was alarmed and brought him a glass of water.,f
35819,"As she stood over him, the womanly concern in her face touched him not a little, and he threw his arms around her and drew her down to him.",f
35820,"""Kiss me once, Belle,"" he pleaded hoarsely.",f
35821,With a violent effort she freed herself.,f
35822,"""It's not hygienic,"" she explained, ""and frequently causes disease.""",f
35823,"Tom stared at her in open-mouthed wonder, and soon after took his departure.",f
35824,"Once inside his room, he sat down to close analysis of himself.",f
35825,"He had been working too hard, and was temporarily unbalanced.",f
35826,She was quite right in saying that it caused disease; such a thing must not happen.,f
35827,"His reason had been impaired by long hours in the office; otherwise he would never have thought of doing such a foolish, unreasonable thing.",f
35828,In the morning he received a note from her.,f
35829,"She had been summoned to the bedside of a sick sister, and would be away from home as long as she was needed.",f
35830,The next month was a long one for Tom.,f
35831,He was surprised to find how much of his life could be filled by a woman.,f
35832,After they were married there would be no such separations.,f
35833,He wrote regularly and received in return such brief notes as her duties permitted her to write.,f
35834,"Then, for a week, none came, and he went to her home to see what news had been received there.",f
35835,"The servant admitted him, half smiling, and in white house gown, by the open fire he saw Belle.",f
35836,"She had never seemed so sweet and womanly, and with a cry he could not repress, he caught her in his arms.",f
35837,"She struggled, but in vain, and at last gave her lips willingly to his.",f
35838,In that minute Tom learned more than all his college course had taught him.,f
35839,"Utterly unconscious of his own temerity, he kissed her again and again.",f
35840,"The little white figure was silent in his arms, and bending low he whispered a word which no reasonable man would ever be caught using.",f
35841,"Her face shining with tears, Belle looked up.",f
35842,"""Tom,"" she said, ""do you love me?""",f
35843,"""Love you!"" he said slowly.",f
35844,"""Why--I guess--I must.""",f
35845,She laughed happily and he drew her closer.,f
35846,"""Dear little girl,"" he said tenderly, ""do you love me?""",f
35847,"The answer came muffled from his shoulder: ""All the time, Tom!""",f
35848,"""All the time!",f
35849,You darling!,f
35850,"What an infernal brute I have been!""",f
35851,"He evidently intended to kiss her again, for he tried to lift her chin from his shoulder.",f
35852,Providence has taught women a great deal about such things.,f
35853,Her eyes flashed with mischief as she struggled to release herself.,f
35854,"""You must let me go, Tom; this isn't reasonable at all!""",f
35855,But his training with the Harvard crew had given him a strength which kept her there.,f
35856,"""Reasonable!"" he repeated.",f
35857,"""Reasonable be hanged!""",f
35858,"Elmiry Ann's Valentine     Elmiry Ann's Valentine   ""Si,"" said Mrs. Safford, ""didn't Elmiry Ann Rogers come in here to-day to buy a valentine?""",f

35864,"""She's a fine one to be buyin' sech trash, when everybody in The Corners knows she ain't hardly got enough to keep soul and body together, let alone clothes and valentines.",f
35865,"I knowed she'd done it, jest as well as if I'd see her do it, 'cause she aint' missed comin' in on the twelfth of February sence we come here, and that is nigh onto fourteen year.""",f
35866,"""Well,"" said Silas, after a long silence, ""what of it?""",f

35873,"""Nope, looks like snow, but I reckon it's too cold.""",f
35874,For perhaps ten minutes the two men talked the dull aimless commonplaces of the country store.,f
35875,"The single lamp with a reflector behind it, made all three faces unlovely and old.",f
35876,"John Weeks was a tall strapping fellow, slightly stooped, and about fifty years old.",f
35877,"His hair was grey at the temples, but his eyes had a kindly twinkle that bid defiance to time.",f
35878,He bought some brown sugar and went out.,f
35879,"One could not blame him for seeking other surroundings, for even at its best, the post-office and general store at The Corners was a gloomy place.",f
35880,Two well-worn steps that creaked noisily were the links between it and the street.,f
35881,"The door opened by an old-fashioned latch, worn with much handling, and inside, a motley smell greeted the inquiring nostril unwonted to the place.",f
35882,The curious sickish odour was a compound of many ingredients blended into one by the all-powerful and all-pervading kerosene.,f
35883,"The floor, moderately clean, was covered with sand and saw-dust, which was occasionally swept out and replaced by a fresh layer.",f
35884,"On the right, as you went in, was a small show-case filled with bright coloured candies, displayed in the original packages.",f
35885,Other boxes were piled in the window and still others on the shelf.,f
35886,"Within a radius of twenty steps one could buy calico, muslin, ruled stationery, or groceries and kerosene, as he might choose.",f
35887,"Once a year, the commonplace merchandise gave way to ""Christmas novelties,"" and during the first two weeks in February the candy show-case was filled with the pretty nonsensical bits of paper called valentines, with a pile of ""comics"" on top.",f
35888,"Every year on the twelfth of February, as Mrs. Safford had said, Elmiry Ann Rogers came in and bought a valentine.",f
35889,"Every year on the fourteenth of February, as the postmaster's keen-eyed wife had noted, Elmiry Ann Rogers had received a valentine.",f
35890,"It was no comic, either, such as one might send to an unprepossessing old maid of forty, but a gorgeous affair of lace paper and cupids, in an ornate wrapping, for more than once, Elmiry's trembling fingers had torn the envelop a bit, as if she could not wait until she reached home.",f
35891,"In many a country town, the buyer of the valentines would have been known as ""Ol' Mis' Rogers,"" but The Corners, lazy, rather than tactful, still clung to the name the pretty girl had gone by.",f
35892,"There was little in Elmiry to recall the graceful figure that was wont to appear in pink muslin or red merino at church and prayer meeting, for the soft curves had become angles, the erect shoulders were bent, and the laughing eyes were now filled with a dumb pathetic sadness.",f
35893,"Elmiry's hair had once fallen in soft curls about her face, but now it was twisted into a hard little knot at the back of her head.",f
35894,"The white dimpled hands were dark and scrawny now, but people still spoke of her as ""Elmiry Ann.""",f
35895,The morning of the thirteenth dawned cloudy and cold.,f
35896,"The postmaster went out of town on business, and his wife had her hands full.",f
35897,"She moved briskly from one part of the store to the other, making change, rectifying mistakes, and attending to the mail.",f
35898,"At noon a crowd of children came in after ""comics"" and John Weeks stood by, watching aimlessly.",f
35899,"""You want any valentines, Mr. Weeks?"" asked Mrs. Safford.",f

35910,"""Stock's runnin' down now, but if there's any lef they can be kep' over.",f
35911,We've had one now for goin' on five year.,f
35912,"It's a fifty cent one, an it's pretty too.",f
35913,"Elmiry's looked at it every year but I guess it's too expensive.""",f
35914,"""Lemme see it.""",f
35915,It was the same size as the others but it had more lace paper on it and more cupids.,f
35916,Weeks was evidently pleased with it and paid the fifty cents without a murmur.,f
35917,"""Makes me feel sorter silly to be buyin' one o' them things,"" he said awkwardly, ""but I'm allers glad to do a favour for a friend an' I'll take it off your hands.""",f
35918,"""Much obliged,"" returned Mrs. Safford.",f
35919,"""Who you lowin' to send it to?""",f
35920,Weeks considered carefully.,f
35921,"""I've got a little nephew over to Taylorville,"" he said, ""and I reckon he'd be right pleased with it.""",f
35922,Another avalanche of children descended upon the valentine counter and in the confusion he escaped.,f
35923,"Busy as she was, Mrs. Safford found time to meditate upon Elmiry and her romance.",f
35924,"""They do say that John Weeks used to set up some with Elmiry,"" she thought, ""and then it was broke off, but there ain't either of 'em married.",f
35925,"I sh'd think he'd want a woman to do for him, and poor Elmiry--her little house is most eat up by the mortgage.",f
35926,The squire was a-sayin' the other day that he thought she'd soon be on the town 'cause she ain't paid the intrust lately.,f

35929,"Well, it takes all kinds of people to make up a world!""",f
35930,"Early in the afternoon she sorted the mail, as usual, but there was nothing for Elmiry.",f
35931,A strange fact of the case was that the valentine had always come from The Corners.,f
35932,"Mrs. Safford began to hope Elmiry would not be disappointed, then the latch clicked, and she came in.",f
35933,"""I want half a pound of dried beef, Mis' Safford,"" Elmiry said, ""an' a quarter of a pound of rice, an' a jug of merlasses, an' a spool of black thread, number sixty.""",f
35934,"""Would you mind writin' down your order, Mis' Rogers?",f
35935,"I'll send Si over with it when he comes, 'cause I've got to get this mail off in a few minutes an' I ain't got time.""",f
35936,"Elmiry seemed disappointed, but wrote her needs on a piece of wrapping paper, using the short blunt pencil which was suspended by a piece of twine from the show-case.",f
35937,"Her writing was cramped, old-fashioned, and as distinctive as it was odd.",f
35938,"When Mrs. Safford had time to look at the order, she became greatly excited.",f
35939,"""If that ain't the beatenest?"" she said to herself.",f
35940,"""Who'd have thought it?",f
35941,"'Course, maybe it ain't, but I'm goin' to make sure!""",f
35942,"Late in the afternoon Elmiry came in again, and as before, she was the only customer.",f
35943,"""I jest thought I'd take my things, Mis' Safford,"" she said by way of explanation, ""'cause I want to use some merlasses right away and 't ain't no need to trouble Mr. Safford, if you've got time to do 'em up.""",f
35944,"""I've got 'em all ready, Elmiry.""",f
35945,"So Miss Rogers arranged the bundles under her shawl and Mrs. Safford caught sight of something white, held tightly in the dark scrawny hand.",f
35946,"""'T want thread, nor rice,"" she thought, as Elmiry went out, ""and I know 't want her handkerchief.",f

35949,"Dusk brought the storm which had threatened for two days, and a bitter north wind came with it.",f
35950,"In an hour the world was white, and belated foot-falls were muffled by the snow.",f
35951,"At nine the store closed, and at half-past nine, Elmiry Ann Rogers wrapped her threadbare shawl around her and started down the street to the post-office.",f
35952,"It was a difficult journey, for the snow was three inches deep and was still coming down, but Elmiry knew the way so well that she could have gone with her eyes shut, if necessary.",f
35953,"She was stiff with the cold when she got there, and was fumbling with the opening in the door marked ""mail"" when a deep masculine voice at her elbow startled her into an impulsive little scream.",f

35955,"""My goodness, Mr. Weeks, how you scairt me!"" she answered trembling.",f

35966,He slipped her arm through his and turned down the street.,f
35967,"Elmiry felt a burning blush on her cold cheeks, for it had been years, more than she cared to remember, since any one had taken her home.",f
35968,"As they went on, Mr. Weeks did the talking and Elmiry endeavoured to collect her scattered senses.",f
35969,"There was something strangely sweet in the feeling that she had a protector, and she wondered dimly how she had ever had the courage to take the trip alone.",f
35970,"When they reached her door, she turned to bid him good-night, but he seemed to take no notice of it.",f

36025,"They wanted I s'd tell her, but someways, I don't like the idea.",f
36026,"She'll be kep' warm and she'll be better off, and she'll have plenty of comp'ny, but I knowed her when she went to school, an' I knowed her mother too.",f
36027,"For the sake of auld lang syne I don't want to hurt her.""",f
36028,"""Sho now, ain't that too bad?"" said both the Saffords together.",f
36029,"Nobody knew just when Mr. Weeks left the store, and Elmiry Ann was startled when she opened the door in response to his vigorous rap.",f
36030,"She had not been at home long, and the colour still burned in her cheeks.",f
36031,"The valentines lay on the table, presenting a strange contrast to their bleak and commonplace surroundings.",f
36032,"""Why, how do you do?"" she exclaimed with a queer little note in her voice.",f
36033,"""Will you come in?""",f
36034,"""Yes, I'll come in,"" he said decisively.",f
36035,He shut the door with a bang and took the trembling frightened woman into his arms.,f
36036,"""Elmiry!",f

36041,"""It's sense, I reckon, Elmiry, an' it's been a long time comin'.",f
36042,"I was huffed 'cause you never made no answer to the valentine I sent you, an' I thought you didn't want me, so I just stayed away.""",f
36043,"""What valentine?""",f
36044,Elmiry's eyes were very big and fearful.,f
36045,"""Don't you remember that valentine I sent you?--Let's see, it's so long ago--I've most forgot what it was.",f
36046,"It said:    ""'The rose is red, the violet blue,   Pinks are sweet and so are you;",f
36047,"Give me your heart, you have mine--   Will you be my valentine?'""  ""Yes,"" said Elmiry slowly, ""I remember.""",f
36048,She went to the Family Bible which lay on the marble-topped table in the front room and took it out.,f
36049,It was worn and faded and there were spots on it which looked like tears.,f
36050,"""Did you mean that,"" she asked with difficulty, ""for a-a----""  ""Yes, I did,"" answered John, ""an' I thought it was cunnin', but I see now, what a blamed fool I was.",f

36053,The poor little old maid smiled through her blinding tears.,f
36054,"""Oh, John,"" she said, ""I've waited so long!""",f
36055,Then she broke down and sobbed helplessly in his arms.,f
36056,"Elmiry forgot the empty years, and the pathetic valentines, so dearly bought--it was so sweet to be loved and taken care of by a masterful man.",f
36057,"Neither heard the jingle of sleigh-bells 'till a voice shouted:  ""Whoa,"" outside, and Doctor Jones started towards the gate.",f
36058,"""Who's that?"" said Elmiry.",f
36059,"""It's the Doctor--he wants to see me about something and I'll go right out.""",f
36060,"""No, I'm sure it's me, he wants to see, John,"" said Elmiry sadly.",f
36061,"""'Tain't neither.",f
36062,"He see me a-comin' here.""",f
36063,"Without stopping to put on his overcoat Weeks rushed out slamming the door behind him, as he went.",f
36064,"The conversation was brief, but to the point, and presently the Doctor drove off with a smile on his face.",f
36065,"""Didn't he want to see me, John?"" asked Elmiry tearfully.",f
36066,"""No, it was me, as I told you, but he sent in his congratulations.""",f
36067,"""His congratulations!",f
36068,"Oh, John!",f

36071,The Knighthood of Tony     The Knighthood of Tony   It was such a pretty bicycle!,f
36072,Tony fondled the glittering spokes and examined the pedals with the air of a connoisseur.,f
36073,"He forgot the hump on his back, and his solitary little house on the outskirts of the village in the joy of his new possession.",f
36074,Only the night before Mrs. Carroll had sent for him and given it to him.,f
36075,"""Arthur wanted you to have it;"" she said with a tremor in her voice.",f
36076,"Between Tony and the delicate child for whom the wheel was bought, there had been a strong bond of sympathy.",f
36077,"Tony was always ready to talk to him, or to take him to the woods, and Arthur was the only human being Tony knew, aside from Mrs. Carroll, who did not jeer at the hump on his back, or shrink from him as though he were an evil thing.",f
36078,"When Arthur died, Tony felt a terrible sense of loss, although he was a man in years and his friend was but a child.",f
36079,"On account of his deformity, the wheel was none too small.",f
36080,If he could only ride it!,f
36081,"He shivered as he thought of the shout of derision which would inevitably be his share, should he venture to ride it through the village streets.",f
36082,"But there was the long smooth stretch of road which led to the next town, and there were innumerable paths through the woods that he knew and loved.",f
36083,The people in the village need never know that he had it.,f
36084,He could ride out there and no one be the wiser.,f
36085,He pushed it into his bedroom and shut the door.,f
36086,"He had one other treasure--an old flute; and in spite of the cruel hump it was a very happy Tony who went to sleep that night, with one hand stretched out upon the saddle of the beautiful new wheel.",f
36087,His father had been a shoemaker and by lifelong toil had left a little competence to his son.,f
36088,Tony knew the trade also and sometimes worked at it.,f
36089,"All that he was thus enabled to make by his own efforts, he invested in books at the store in the next town.",f
36090,"He felt dimly that it would not be right to use his father's money in this way, but his own was a different matter.",f
36091,"There was a tiny paint-box too, with which he sometimes copied the pictures in the books.",f
36092,"On the white wall of his bedroom was a poor copy of a Madonna, whose beauty he felt, but could not express.",f
36093,"In some way, the Madonna took the place of the mother he had never known, and whose picture, even, he had never seen.",f
36094,"Man though he was in years, Tony had dreams of a soft hand brushing back his hair, and sweet cool lips pressed against his own.",f
36095,"When he came back from his weekly trips to the village store, stung to the quick by the taunts and derisions of his fellow-men, he had sobbed himself to sleep many a time longing for that gracious hollow in a woman's shoulder, which seemed made for such as he.",f
36096,"With the first streaks of dawn, Tony started for the woods with his bicycle.",f
36097,"There was a wide shady path, well hidden by trees, and here, he made his first attempts.",f
36098,"It seemed a long, long time before he could ride even a little way, and the hard falls bruised, but did not discourage him.",f
36099,"Day after day, in the early light, he led his silent steed to the secret place and returned after nightfall that none might see him.",f
36100,The trees at the side of the path were more of a help than a hindrance.,f
36101,Often he had restored his balance by reaching out to a friendly trunk.,f
36102,"The feeling of confidence which every bicyclist remembers, came at last, and he rode up and down the path, making the turns at the end with perfect ease, until he dropped off from sheer weariness.",f
36103,The next day he took his flute and his wheel and a bit of lunch into the woods.,f
36104,"He rode on the path until he was a bit tired, and then sat down on the grass and began to play.",f
36105,"He knew no music but what the birds had taught him, and the simple little melodies he had heard his father hum.",f
36106,"Call after call of the mocking-bird and robin he imitated on his flute, until the little creatures flocked around him as if he had been one of them.",f
36107,Tony found the purest pleasure in the society of his feathered friends.,f
36108,"They never noticed his crooked body, but with that unfailing sight which seems to belong to birds and animals, recognised the soul within, and knew that they need have no fear of him.",f
36109,"At that very minute, a robin was perched upon the handle-bar of his wheel, his bright eyes fixed upon Tony, who was calling to him with his own voice in such a wonderful way that the red-breasted visitor was well-nigh dumb with astonishment.",f
36110,"With a sudden cry of alarm, Sir Robin fluttered into a tree above and Tony looked up to behold a strange and altogether lovely thing.",f
36111,"It was only a pretty girl in a well-made bicycle suit of blue corduroy, with her wheel beside her, but to Tony she was even more beautiful than the Madonna.",f
36112,"""Excuse me,"" she said;",f
36113,"""but I simply couldn't help stopping to listen.""",f
36114,Tony blushed uncomfortably but he made no reply.,f
36115,"""It must be a great pleasure to be able to call the birds to you like that,"" she went on;",f
36116,"""I really envy you the gift.""",f
36117,He was transfixed with delight.,f
36118,This beautiful straight human being actually envied him the tiny bit of music he could make with his flute!,f
36119,His primitive hospitality came to the rescue.,f
36120,"""Won't you sit down?"" he said timidly.",f
36121,"She was very willing to sit down, and almost before he knew it, he found himself telling her about his little cabin, the father who brought him up, and how Mrs. Carroll had given him the bicycle because he had been good to her little boy before he died.",f
36122,She admired the wheel very much and talked over its good points with Tony until he felt perfectly at ease.,f
36123,She asked him his name and gave him her own.,f
36124,"She was Miss Atherton, staying in a house just outside the village with her invalid brother.",f
36125,"The doctor thought the air of the woods would be good for him, so she had ""packed up, bag and baggage,"" as she expressed it, and brought her horse, bicycle, piano and a trained nurse to the village for the summer.",f
36126,She wanted Tony to come and see them the very next morning and bring his flute.,f
36127,Her brother would enjoy the music and he could come up on his wheel and stay all day.,f
36128,She waved her hand to him as she rode away through the woods towards her home.,f
36129,It was the first time Tony had ever been asked to visit any one except the little boy who had died.,f
36130,"He remembered every detail of her face and dress, the velvety softness of the corduroy, the tiny watch at her belt, and the brown eyes, so much like those of the Madonna, that he felt as if he had known her always.",f
36131,But one thing troubled him.,f
36132,She did not seem to see the curve between his shoulders.,f
36133,Perhaps it was because he was leaning against a tree all the time she was there.,f
36134,"If she had seen it, she would certainly have spoken of it.",f
36135,"She might not make fun of him, but she would surely have pitied him, which was almost as bad.",f
36136,"Even Mrs. Carroll who was always kind, did that.",f
36137,"No, Miss Atherton had not seen it, and his dread of her discovering it was the one flaw in his present anticipations.",f
36138,"She, herself, in a pretty white gown, welcomed him at the door.",f
36139,"Mr. Atherton lay in an invalid chair with a table at his side, and shook hands graciously with Tony.",f
36140,It was such a happy day!,f
36141,"He learned the first moves in chess and Miss Atherton played a tender, running accompaniment on the piano to the bird music he made with his flute.",f
36142,They all had luncheon on the wide veranda and Tony had not dreamed such dainty things were possible.,f
36143,"They talked of their travels in Europe and Egypt, before Mr. Atherton was taken ill, and showed him pictures of wonderful things in the lands across the sea.",f
36144,"She read aloud and sang softly to the half-hushed chords her brother picked out on the guitar, and Tony in a perfect wilderness of enjoyment, forgot all about his crooked shoulders.",f
36145,That day was the first in a long series of happy ones.,f
36146,"He learned to play chess well enough to make himself a formidable antagonist, and after Miss Atherton taught him the notes on the piano he found them on the flute, and began to play simple melodies from the music.",f
36147,"Sometimes they all played together, very softly in the twilight--piano, flute and guitar; until it became time for the invalid to be wheeled into his room.",f
36148,"Sometimes even after that, Tony would sit on the veranda while she sang or talked to him.",f
36149,"Through the long night he dreamed of her, as many a lover dreams of his sweetheart.",f
36150,Beautiful Miss Atherton!,f
36151,"He worshipped her from afar off, as a child looks at a star.",f
36152,"It was Tony who knew where the violets grew, and who in the dim silence of dawn laid handfuls of them at her door.",f
36153,"And it was he who brought her a great sheaf of pond-lilies, dripping and sweet.",f
36154,"""Oh, Tony!"" she cried, ""where do they grow?""",f
36155,His face flushed with pleasure.,f
36156,"""I'll take you there if you want to go.""",f
36157,"""Indeed I do,"" she exclaimed, ""can we go on our wheels?""",f
36158,"""Yes, that's the best way, though it's rough in some places.""",f
36159,"""I don't mind that,"" she answered, ""come early in the morning and we'll stay all day.""",f
36160,That afternoon he went to the village store to buy his week's provisions.,f
36161,"Half-a-dozen men who were loafing in front of it asked no better sport than to get him into a corner, so that he could not escape, and fling at him taunts and jeers about his crooked body.",f
36162,"It was fun to see the sensitive face flush with anger, or quiver with pain, and it was not until his self-control was entirely gone and he sank in a sobbing heap on the floor, that they let him go.",f
36163,The night was one of torture to him.,f
36164,"It was not the mother he had never seen who could comfort him now, but Miss Atherton.",f
36165,"His idea of heaven was a place where he might always be within the sound of her voice, within reach of her hand, and where she would look kindly upon him.",f
36166,He was thankful that the way to her house lay beyond the village and not through it.,f
36167,He would never dare to show himself there on his wheel.,f
36168,And the road to the lilies ran through the woods; none would see to-morrow when he went there with her.,f
36169,She was already on the veranda in her bicycle suit when he rode up the next morning.,f
36170,She tied a basket of lunch to his wheel and a book to her own.,f
36171,"""You see we are going to stay all day,"" she said, ""and I couldn't think of starting without refreshment for body and mind.",f
36172,"My brother has an armful of new books which came from the city yesterday, and he didn't even hear me when I said good-bye.""",f
36173,"They started, Miss Atherton chatting busily and Tony too happy to speak except in monosyllables.",f
36174,"A turn in the road brought them to a branch of the river, white with lilies in full bloom.",f
36175,She dismounted with a little cry of delight.,f
36176,"""Oh, how white and sweet they are!""",f
36177,"Tony found a boat moored by the side of the stream and they soon had gathered a great sheaf of the golden-hearted censers, rich with fragrance, which they covered with cool ferns in the shade of the trees until they should be ready to take them home.",f
36178,Being collected early in the day they were fresher and sweeter than if they had been allowed to feel the heat of the later morning sun.,f
36179,"The lilies well cared for, they sat down under a tree and she read to him the story of Launcelot.",f
36180,"His brave deeds and manly service, his love for Guenevere, and the spirit of romance and knightly courage which seemed to fairly breathe from the pages, held Tony spellbound.",f
36181,"""Miss Atherton,"" he said wistfully, as she finished, ""I'd like to be one of those fellows.""",f
36182,"""You can be,"" she answered.",f
36183,"""How?"" he asked, his eyes wide open in astonishment.",f
36184,"""Any man is a knight,"" she said, ""who does what is given him to do, wisely and well.",f
36185,"It's not the horses and the armour, Tony, it's the man, and you can be as brave and true as Launcelot, if you only will.",f
36186,"Never permit yourself to speak, or even think slightingly of a woman, and if you have the opportunity to help one, do it at any cost.",f
36187,"That's the foundation of true knighthood and true manhood, too.",f
36188,"See, I give you my colours; be my knight if you will,"" and she leaned forward smilingly to tie a white fragrant scarf around his arm.",f
36189,"But to her surprise, Tony burst into tears.",f
36190,"And then a part of his dream came true, for Miss Atherton put her arm around him and drew him close to her.",f
36191,"""Tony, dear, what is it?",f
36192,"Tell me!""",f
36193,"With his face half buried in the sweet comforting place he had longed for, but had never known, he sobbed out all the bitterness of his heart.",f
36194,"He told her of the taunts and jeers which made his crooked life a burden--of all the loneliness before he knew her, and someway too, he told her of his longing for his mother whom he had never seen, and whose place he had tried to fill with the picture of the Madonna.",f
36195,That day in the woods gave Tony undreamed-of strength.,f
36196,He even offered to do Miss Atherton's errands at the store.,f
36197,"They did not know that he was a knight bearing his lady's colours--that he was in her service and would be to the very end of the world, for even death, he thought, could never make any difference in his loyalty to her.",f
36198,"He was Launcelot and she was Guenevere--it was his secret, and even she must never know.",f
36199,"Toward the end of the summer he rode up to Miss Atherton's with a great bunch of goldenrod, which only he knew where to find.",f
36200,She came to the door white and worried.,f
36201,"""My brother is very ill, Tony,"" she said, ""and I have sent my groom for the doctor, but he has been gone so long that I fear something may have happened to him.",f
36202,"Would you go--on your wheel?""",f
36203,"For a moment, as the vision of the village store, on the only street that led to the doctor's house, with its crowd of loafers came before him, Tony hesitated.",f
36204,Would Launcelot hesitate with Guenevere in need?,f
36205,"""I'll go, Miss Atherton,"" he said quietly.",f
36206,"Terror struck him as he came in sight of the store and saw the men he most feared, sitting in front of it.",f
36207,"Mutely praying for help, he bent to his pedals.",f
36208,"But they had seen him, and rushed out into the street with a shout.",f
36209,It was an easy matter for them to stop his wheel.,f
36210,"""Let me go!",f
36211,"Let me go!"" he cried, ""Miss Atherton's brother is sick, and I'm going for the doctor!""",f
36212,"""That's a likely story,"" said one of them.",f
36213,"""Bet a hat you stole this velocipede.",f
36214,"She wouldn't send a hunchy like you anywheres.""",f
36215,"""Mebby she might,"" said the keeper of the store.",f
36216,"""That's the city gal he's goin' to marry.",f
36217,"I seen her in the woods kissin' him!""",f
36218,"White with rage, not for himself, but that the dear name of his Lady should be soiled by their lips, Tony raised his slender arm to strike.",f
36219,"""Say what you please to me,"" he muttered between his clenched teeth, ""but if you dare to even _speak_ of her, I'll----""  Tony said no more, for one of the men half crazed with liquor, lifted the bicycle suddenly, and with a single blow across the curve between his shoulders, dashed him heavily to the ground.",f
36220,"Thoroughly frightened, the crowd dispersed leaving Tony in the dusty road, amid the wreck of his wheel.",f
36221,Meanwhile the doctor had arrived with Miss Atherton's servant.,f
36222,"In half an hour the invalid was resting quietly, and as the doctor took his leave, Miss Atherton told him how she had sent Tony after him on his bicycle only a few minutes before he arrived.",f
36223,"""You shouldn't have done that,"" he said.",f
36224,"""There's a rough crowd of men in the town, and they are very likely to harm the little chap if they have half a chance.",f
36225,"I'll look for him as I go home and have him come and tell you that he is safe.""",f
36226,"Not a man was in sight when the doctor found Tony, and even the shades of the store windows were closely drawn.",f
36227,"After vainly knocking at the door, he smashed in the window with a strong stick, and entering, found the men who were wont to loaf in front of the store, huddled in a corner of it.",f
36228,"With the voice of one accustomed to command, he made them improvise a stretcher under his directions, and three of them helped him carry Tony home.",f
36229,The doctor shook his head gravely when questioned as to the extent of the injury.,f
36230,"""Some one must stay with him to-night,"" he said.",f
36231,"One of the men volunteered, but a look of such helpless terror came into Tony's eyes, that he sent them all away, telling the last one to go for Miss Atherton.",f
36232,"It was from him that she learned the whole story and fairly trembling with indignation, turned upon him.",f
36233,"""There isn't one of you in this whole village worthy to touch even the hand of the boy you have killed to-day.",f
36234,He was a man--you are nothing but brutes.,f
36235,"Now go, and never let me see your face again.""",f
36236,The doctor met her at the door of Tony's little house.,f
36237,"""You'd better stay with him,"" he said in a low tone.",f
36238,"""He can't last until morning, and your brother will be perfectly safe with the nurse.",f
36239,I'll go up to your house and send down anything you may need.,f
36240,"My man will come and stay within call.""",f
36241,"Miss Atherton gave him a note to the nurse, and then went in to Tony.",f
36242,"His eyes brightened at the sight of her, and he tried to speak.",f
36243,"""Hush, dear,"" she said, ""it's all right.",f
36244,"The doctor came just after you left, and my brother is in no danger now.",f
36245,"I've come to stay with you.""",f
36246,"Her cool hand brushed back the hair from his forehead, and moved by an impulse of womanly pity, she knelt beside him and laid her cheek against his own.",f
36247,He closed his eyes and seemed to sleep.,f
36248,Her eyes wandered around the little room.,f
36249,A table stood in the corner of it.,f
36250,"A cabinet photograph of herself in a pasteboard frame, around which Tony had painted a wreath of pond-lilies, stood in the centre of it beside a cracked cup filled with early autumn flowers.",f
36251,"The flute lay straight across the front, like a votive offering, and underneath the photograph was written in his large, unformed hand: ""My Guenevere.""",f
36252,"At last she understood, and feeling that his little shrine was too holy for even her eyes to see, she turned them away.",f
36253,"Tony stirred, and she slipped her arm under his shoulders.",f
36254,"""Miss Atherton?""",f
36255,"""Yes, dear.""",f
36256,"""Did--did--they--tell you--what they said?""",f
36257,"""Yes, dear.""",f
36258,Her eyes filled.,f
36259,"""I didn't mind--for myself--but----""  ""Hush, dear;",f
36260,"I know.""",f
36261,"Feeling herself unworthy in the presence of a true knightly soul, Miss Atherton held him untiringly in her arms.",f
36262,"When he cried out with pain, she drew him close to her, and pillowed his head upon her breast.",f
36263,"""Am--I--going to--die--Miss Atherton?""",f
36264,"She could hardly whisper the words: ""I am afraid so, Tony.""",f
36265,"""Will you--stay--until----""  ""Yes, dear.""",f
36266,"""And--afterward--you won't let--them--touch me?""",f
36267,"""No, Tony, no.""",f
36268,His eyes followed hers as she looked at the little shrine again.,f
36269,"""Do you mind?"" he whispered anxiously.",f
36270,"""I thought--you wouldn't know--if I called--you--Guenevere--at home.""",f
36271,"""Tony, dear, no queen ever had a braver, truer knight than you have been to me.",f
36272,"Even Launcelot was not half so noble in the service of Guenevere, as you have been in mine.""",f
36273,He smiled happily and seemed to sleep again.,f
36274,"Just at dawn, he said weakly: ""Miss Atherton?""",f
36275,"""What is it, Tony?""",f
36276,"""The lilies--are opening--about now,--ar'n't they?""",f
36277,"""I shouldn't wonder.",f

36279,"""Would--you--you--kiss me--just--once?",f
36280,"I used--to dream--you did--and--and----""  With a sob she could not hide, she drew him close.",f
36281,"He sighed contentedly as he put his frail arms around her, like a weary child, and with his Guenevere's kisses on his lips and brow, her little Launcelot blossomed into the light of which she had told him.",f
36282,"Her Volunteer     Her Volunteer   The flags fluttered listlessly in the warm spring air, and the little group on Jean Perry's piazza was scarcely more energetic.",f
36283,"There was a martial significance in the atmosphere, for the heavy tread of battalions reverberated in the hearts of those who had seen one war, and came forth with sudden force to those who were about to live through it for the first time.",f
36284,"Yet, the few who lounged in hammocks spoke in depreciation.",f
36285,"""The regular army is enough,"" said one;",f
36286,"""that's what those fellows are for.",f
36287,"As for me, I'm not anxious to be shot at.",f
36288,"I would rather be excused.""",f
36289,"Two or three of the others agreed, but Jack Terrence was watching Jean with grave trouble in his face.",f
36290,"At the first sneering comment her eyes had flashed and then filled; now her breast was heaving with excitement, and her sensitive mouth was quivering.",f
36291,"A passing breeze stirred the scarlet veined folds of the flag above her, and for a moment it seemed to wave in proud defiance.",f
36292,"But even as the century of its glorious history came back to her, one of the men looking at it reminiscently, was moved to languid speech.",f
36293,"""Funny thing, that rag up there--I suppose it really means a great deal to some people!""",f
36294,"""Do you honestly think so?""",f
36295,Jean's voice carried a note of fearful scorn.,f
36296,"""I am proud to say that I am one of the people to whom it means something--more than your little mind can comprehend.",f
36297,"If I could die fighting for it, and have it wrapped round me at the last, it would be glory enough for one small life, but I'm only a miserable woman, and I have to stay at home.",f
36298,"Why ar'n't you in the ranks, fighting like a man?",f
36299,"What do you think would become of your country if all the men were like you?""",f
36300,She ended convincingly.,f
36301,The astonished individual whom she addressed made the earliest exit compatible with his dignity.,f
36302,"The girls followed by twos and threes, and at last the time came to which Terrence had looked forward for an hour--a solitary moment with Jean.",f
36303,"""Let's go down to the river,"" he said, after waiting for her to speak.",f
36304,"He took possession of her in the calm, masterful way that rests and soothes a nervous woman, and as his ring on her finger gave him the right to do.",f
36305,"He found her hat and put it on her unresisting head without jabbing her with the pins, for which, even in her excitement, she was dimly grateful.",f
36306,"""You're such a comfort, Jack,"" she sighed restfully, as they strolled in the afternoon sunshine to the bank of the little noisy stream, that by courtesy was called a river.",f
36307,"""I get tired and fretted, and when you come it's just like putting on a pair of old shoes after you've been wearing new ones.""",f
36308,Terrence laughed.,f
36309,"He was used to Jean's queer similes, and loved her all the more for her unexpectedness.",f
36310,"""You take things too seriously, dear, but just the same I was very proud of you this afternoon.",f
36311,"You scattered the enemy's forces neatly.""",f
36312,"He laughed again, but this time there was no mirth in his face.",f
36313,"""I was glad, too, Jean, because it makes it easier to speak of something I've been thinking about for the last two weeks.""",f
36314,For an instant her heart stood still.,f
36315,She did not need to be told what had made him unlike his sunny self for the past few days.,f
36316,He turned his face away that he might not see the trouble in hers.,f
36317,She began to understand.,f
36318,After a little he spoke again.,f
36319,"""Dear little woman,"" he said softly, ""it all rests with you.",f
36320,It is for you to decide--not me.,f
36321,"If you feel that my first duty is to you, you have only to say the word; if you feel that, dearly as I love you, there is something beyond that, you--you need not speak at all.""",f
36322,"They were sitting on the bank of the stream now, and the late afternoon light was playing upon its rippling surface, while a glory of crimson and gold touched each rock and tree.",f
36323,"Half-way up the hill beyond, was a tiny two-story house in process of construction.",f
36324,"On the crest, where the sun might shine on it longest, the flag seemed beckoning to them both.",f
36325,They felt its meaning.,f
36326,"""Jean,"" said Jack again, and his lips trembled as they said the little name, ""is the roof of our home coming between us and our flag?""",f
36327,"""If it did,"" she answered slowly, ""it could only be a house--not a home.""",f
36328,In those few moments she had fought a gallant battle with herself.,f
36329,"She was white now, but there was new strength in her voice.",f
36330,"""Brave heart,"" said Terrence tenderly, ""I knew what you would say!""",f
36331,"Then he went on to tell her of the regiment that was forming, and in which he had been offered a position in the line of promotion.",f
36332,Something of the old fire came into her eyes.,f
36333,"""Never mind position or promotion.",f
36334,Put on the private's uniform and fight in the ranks and be glad you've got the health and the strength and the right to do it.,f
36335,"Though,"" she added, as an afterthought, ""I'd try to be reconciled to it, even if you were a major-general.""",f
36336,She smiled slyly.,f
36337,There was no one to see him put his arm around her in the twilight and draw her close.,f
36338,"The soft melody of the little stream, as it hurried noisily away, and the drowsy chirp of the birds came dreamily into the summer stillness.",f
36339,"Up on the hill, like a parting benediction, a soft sunset glow trembled and shone around the flag.",f
36340,"""My sweetheart,"" he said, ""I want to tell you something for you to remember for all time.""",f
36341,"A lump came into his throat, but he choked it down and went on.",f
36342,"""It sounds like a joke in a comic paper for me to say you're the only woman I ever loved; but it's true, and you know it is, and it's the kind of love that couldn't die with the body of either of us, don't you know that, dear?""",f
36343,A sob from Jean made him draw her closer still.,f
36344,"""So I want to tell you now that, whatever happens, that will always be the same--nothing can ever change that.",f
36345,I want you to remember that.,f
36346,"I haven't half deserved the love you've given me, but it's the sweetest thing God ever let a man dream of, and it's made me a better man, Jean, and there won't be a moment while I'm away that I won't see your dear face, because I'm fighting for you as well as for my dear country--to be the man you want me to be, and to make you proud of your volunteer.""",f
36347,The succeeding days were all confusion and preparation.,f
36348,"To Terrence, they were days of drill, recruiting and unaccustomed labour; to Jean they were days of heartache, mingled with a strange pride that was neither wholly happiness nor wholly pain.",f
36349,"The day came at last when the regiment was ordered forward, and the whole town turned out to give its boys a rousing farewell.",f
36350,"The love of fight, mingled with the stern discipline and cool courage of the Anglo-Saxon, was in the face of every man in the regiment.",f
36351,Jean never forgot the spectacle as they formed in marching ranks.,f
36352,"In spite of the pain at her heart, she was unreasonably proud at the sight of Jack in his new uniform--not that of a private, as she had wished him to go, but as first lieutenant, looking very handsome.",f
36353,The long column swung into line.,f
36354,Quick and short came the word of command.,f
36355,"Her eyes were upon her volunteer, and across the crowd of waiting thousands, he saw only her--cheeks crimson with pride, eyes sweet with love, and lips that trembled and tried to be brave in spite of all.",f
36356,"""Forward, march!""",f
36357,It was the summons to the glory and the agony of battle for those who kept time with the music.,f
36358,It was the summons to as brave a faith to those who remained behind.,f
36359,"After the first shock was over, Jean became almost happy.",f
36360,Jack wrote letters full of hope and good spirits.,f
36361,"Every amusing thing that happened in camp, he stored away to write to Jean.",f
36362,"He even had a little note-book in which to jot down, from time to time, things which would interest her.",f
36363,"This was a never failing source of pleasure to his mates, and he was enthusiastically ""guyed"" by every man in the company.",f
36364,"Of course he told her this, and, womanlike, Jean was much pleased.",f
36365,"Boxes of home delicacies sent to Jack filled the entire company with a beautiful admiration for ""Terrence's girl.""",f
36366,"Magazines, papers and letters almost flooded the mails.",f
36367,"""Poor Terrence is getting pale,"" said one of them at mess.",f
36368,"""Separation,"" suggested the corporal.",f
36369,"""Naw,"" rejoined the other.",f
36370,"""It's carryin' his mail from the post-office to his tent.",f
36371,"That's what's wearin' on him.""",f
36372,"Like a happy lover, Terrence took the jokes cheerfully.",f
36373,"The routine of camp life made some of the men complain bitterly, but he said never a word.",f
36374,It was for his country--and Jean.,f
36375,"After two months of waiting, the regiment was ordered to the front and the old confusion began again.",f
36376,The night in camp was a memorable one.,f
36377,"Already the star-spangled flag had been planted in new places, and the thirst for conquest, which is perhaps, more Anglo-Saxon than exclusively British, was upon every man in the army.",f
36378,There is no need to write of the gallant charge at Santiago; no need to speak of the steadfast courage of those who faced three times their number in the narrow pass; no need to say that every lad in Uncle Sam's uniform proved himself to be the stuff of which Republics are built--for the world knows it all.,f
36379,"Whatever criticism the strategists of the future, sitting in comfortable chairs, may make, as to tactics and military skill, the valour of the American army has been proved anew.",f
36380,"Up the burning, blazing heights, Lieutenant Terrence rushed with his men, stopping not for strange pitfalls and unknown dangers, facing volley after volley of explosive bullets, heeding not those who fell by the way, as long as through the smoke of battle, dimly lit by flash and flame, the flag called--""Follow!""",f
36381,"The orders had been brief: ""Take the blockhouse on the height by storm.""",f
36382,And the charge began with a cheer.,f
36383,"But only twenty-two of the seventy-five men reached the summit, and after a fierce hand-to-hand conflict, dislodged the superior force.",f
36384,"The rest lay upon the hillside,--some past help, and all exposed to the fire of an unchivalrous foe.",f
36385,"Lieutenant Terrence was among those reported ""missing.""",f
36386,"The corporal spent the night in the underbrush with a lantern, but to no avail.",f
36387,"""Don't be so cut up, Johnny,"" said a messmate, ""you can't do him no good.""",f
36388,"""Maybe he fell off the side,"" replied the corporal, after a long silence, ""and, anyway, it's his girl I'm thinking of.",f
36389,"I'm going to find him for her.""",f
36390,"Over the wire from headquarters came the list of killed, wounded and missing.",f
36391,"Jean grasped the morning paper eagerly and then grew white ""Missing!",f
36392,"Missing!""",f
36393,A dull dead weight settled down upon her like a suffocating pall.,f
36394,"With sudden meaning, what he had said came back to her: ""It's you I'm fighting for as well as for my country--to be the man you want me to be, and to make you proud of your volunteer.""",f
36395,"The strained nerves and tortured heart could bear no more, and she was mercifully unconscious when they found her lying with the paper in her hands.",f
36396,"There were hushed whispers in the house for days to come, and the wires were kept busy with eager questionings.",f
36397,The old family physician was fighting an unequal battle with death for Jean had no desire to live.,f
36398,"After a week, a telegram came for Jean.",f
36399,"It was the old doctor who opened it with trembling hands, dreading to give her the message he knew it must contain.",f
36400,"After the first eager glance, his face changed mysteriously, and then became transfigured with a radiant smile as he read:  ""Wounded, but not seriously.",f
36401,Home on _Olivette_.,f
36402,"Terrence.""",f
36403,The little blind god has a healing power quite beyond prosaic belief and in a very short time Jean was able to go out and once more the sound of building came from the hillside.,f
36404,All through the days that followed she listened to it with joy.,f
36405,Every ring of metal or shout of command was a distinct pleasure.,f
36406,It was evening when Terrence reached the town unannounced and unheralded with his right arm in a sling.,f
36407,"Those on the piazza merely knew that some one had entered the gate, but a white-robed figure flew down the steps with a cry of gladness that sent the family into the house.",f
36408,"Human hearts did not need to be told that a bronzed and bearded soldier was holding his sweetheart close, and that a woman was sobbing out more happiness than one heart could hold, on the shoulder of her volunteer.",f
36409,In Reflected Glory     In Reflected Glory   Wheels!,f
36410,Wheels!,f
36411,Wheels!,f
36412,"The boulevards were full of them, from the glistening up-to-date mount, back to the antiquated '91 model with its hard tires and widely curved handle-bars.",f
36413,The sun struck the sheen of nickel and new enamel and sent a thousand little needles of light in all directions.,f
36414,"Even the '91 model was beautiful in the light of the spring day, overtaken though it might be by the swiftly moving procession.",f
36415,Wheels!,f
36416,"Every man, woman, and child in the city of Chicago who could beg, borrow, or rent a bicycle, was speeding westward to the flagstaff at the entrance to the Garfield Park Loop.",f
36417,"Every spoke and bar had been polished to the limit, and the long asphalt boulevard was a glittering, sparkling avenue of wheels.",f
36418,Wheels!,f
36419,"It was the day of the great road race, under the auspices of the Associated Cycling Clubs.",f
36420,"The twenty-five mile course had been smoothed and measured, the sky was blue and cloudless, and far away in Wheeling four hundred eager cyclers awaited the bugle call.",f
36421,"John Gardner stood at the door of his news-room and watched with a wistful eye, the few hundred wheelmen who had chosen to ride on the business street that went past his door.",f
36422,"The orange and black of the South Shore Club fluttered from many a shining bar, and at the sight of the colours the old man's face grew tender.",f
36423,"For it was Jack's club that boasted the orange and black--Jack Gardner of the ""Varsity, '98,"" and his only son.",f
36424,A touch on his arm made him turn his face within.,f
36425,"""Father,"" said a gentle voice, ""why don't we go to the doin's?""",f
36426,"""Land sakes, Mother, who'd take care of the store?""",f
36427,"""Guess the store ain't goin' to run away, and we ain't been out in years.",f
36428,"Let's go, Father, and see Jack ride!""",f
36429,"It was John Gardner's way to oppose everything at first, and then to generously give in.",f
36430,"He liked to feel himself master in his own house, so he hesitated.",f
36431,But the stronger will was fully settled upon going.,f
36432,"""I'm a-goin' Father, even if I have to go alone.""",f
36433,"She vanished into the back part of the store and began to brush carefully the state gown, the brown silk, made after the quaint fashion of a bygone day.",f
36434,After a few minutes the old man appeared in the door.,f
36435,"""I reckon we'll go, Hannah,"" he said, with the air of one granting a favour, ""but it do seem wrong to leave the little store!""",f
36436,"For many a year the little store had been open on all holidays, as well as weekdays and evenings, for Jack in school and college had needed money, and a startling amount of it.",f
36437,Old John Gardner never complained.,f
36438,"Hampered, and made ashamed all his life by his lack of ""book larnin',"" he had vowed that his son should have ""a bang-up eddication, the best they is a-goin',"" if he could get it for him.",f
36439,"To-day Jack was to ride in the road race, and imbued with solemn importance Gardner, senior, robed himself for the occasion.",f
36440,They made a queer picture as they stood on the corner waiting for a car.,f
36441,"Hannah's brown silk was wrinkled and shabby, but her thin gray hair arranged in tiny puffs around her forehead, looked, as her fond mate said, ""right smart.""",f
36442,"Twenty years ago, when Jack was a little boy in dresses, his father had bought a silk hat to wear to a funeral, and it was this relic of past splendour which now adorned his head.",f
36443,"Once on the car, a new fear presented itself.",f
36444,"""Mother,"" he said, ""sposen Jack should see us!""",f
36445,For an instant her heart stood still.,f

36447,"""he won't see anything but that new bicycle of his'n and we will come home as soon as it's over.""",f
36448,"""I don't know's we'd ought,"" said the old man doubtfully.",f
36449,"""He might not like it.""",f
36450,"""Like what?"" demanded Hannah sharply.",f
36451,"""Our goin'!""",f
36452,"""Hush, Father,"" she answered, ""you know we don't see Jack very often 'cause he has to live down where his school is.",f
36453,"Lemme see--it's three months now since he's been home, ain't it?""",f
36454,"""Three months yestidy.""",f
36455,"""So what's goin' to hurt if we see him ride to-day?",f
36456,"He'll never notice us among all them folks.""",f
36457,Two girls who sat opposite were watching the old couple with very evident amusement.,f
36458,"""There's rural simplicity for you,"" said one.",f
36459,"""So I see,"" responded the other.",f
36460,"""They appear to be attached to some Jack.",f
36461,"Wouldn't it be funny if it were Jack Gardner?""",f
36462,They laughed in unison and Hannah looked up into their faces.,f
36463,John's eyes followed hers and neither spoke for a moment.,f
36464,They saw nothing but the joy and happiness of girlhood and something blinded them both.,f
36465,Jack was forgotten for the moment in the memory of the little girl who lay in the Silent City beyond the smoke and dust of the town.,f
36466,They left the car when the others did and followed the crowd.,f
36467,"""I don't b'leeve Jack'll see us, Mother,"" said the old man.",f
36468,"""I ain't goin' to worry about it no more.""",f
36469,"Twenty-five miles away, Jack Gardner surveyed his wheel complacently.",f
36470,"Every screw was tightened, his chains were just right, his tires were exactly mellow enough and his handle-bars were at the proper pitch.",f
36471,"He was none the less pleased with his own appearance, for he had written his father that he needed a new suit in the colours worn by the South Shore Club.",f
36472,He had searched the town for the orange and black and finally found them.,f
36473,"The S.S.C. on his black chest could be seen as far as his wheel could, and he had topped the glaring outfit with a flaming orange cap, with a black tassel to stream in the wind behind.",f
36474,"""Get on to the oriole!""",f
36475,The champion of a rival club was inclined to be sportive at Jack's expense.,f
36476,"He retorted with a fling at the green costume of the other, and then the bugle sounded for the flying start.",f
36477,"Anxious friends and trainers shouted, final directions from behind the ""dead line,"" as Jack called it.",f
36478,"Another blare from the bugle, a sudden whir, a flash of the shining spokes and they were off.",f
36479,As the last group flew over the tape the train started back to the city.,f
36480,"A South Shore Club man climbed up on the locomotive to ""josh"" the engineer.",f
36481,"""You'll have to get a move on you, if you catch Gardner,"" he said.",f
36482,The engineer laughed and looked fondly at his giant of steel.,f
36483,Perhaps an engineer enamoured of his engine can understand the love of a cyclist for his wheel.,f
36484,The people around the Garfield Park Loop were beginning to get impatient.,f
36485,"Most of them had stood for two hours holding their bicycles, and even a well behaved bicycle is an awkward possession in a crowd.",f
36486,"Pedals scraped the shins of utterly strange riders, handle-bars got tangled in watch-guards, and front wheels got into mischief with unpleasant regularity.",f
36487,"Close to the course, and on the grassy bank, sat Mr. and Mrs. Gardner.",f
36488,Kindly souls had made way for them until they had at last reached the very front.,f
36489,"The day and the multitude were almost spectacle enough, but a cry from the far north brought them to their feet.",f
36490,"Yes, there they were--a cloud of dust across the field.",f
36491,How small the riders seemed!,f
36492,Nearer and nearer they came--how the shining wheels flew through the sunlight!,f
36493,"Tense, strained faces almost on the handle-bars: every man of them was doing his best, and the crowd was cheering like mad.",f
36494,"The band played merrily, as on and on they flew,--past the judges' stand, over the tape and down, to the mingled praise and solicitude of their friends.",f
36495,The old people were very much disappointed.,f
36496,Jack had not ridden after all!,f
36497,Perhaps--but there was another cloud of dust and another cry from the north.,f
36498,On came another group of riders.,f
36499,"They went by like the whirlwind, but no Jack was there.",f
36500,"""I sh'd have thought he'd got back somewheres near the front,"" said the old man.",f
36501,He was hurt to think his son was so far behind.,f
36502,"Group after group passed by, the old people watching anxiously; then Hannah gripped his arm suddenly.",f
36503,See!,f
36504,"Down the course, only a faint speck now, shone the orange and black of the South Shore Club.",f
36505,"Perhaps----  Yes, riding at the head of thirty tired wheelmen, to the stirring strains of a Sousa march, their Jack, strong, superb, excited, nerving himself for the final effort.",f
36506,Their hearts stopped beating during the instant he was flying by.,f
36507,"""There,"" she whispered reassuringly, ""I told you he wouldn't see us.",f
36508,My!,f
36509,"Wasn't he fine?""",f
36510,"But John Gardner could not speak, for his eyes were dim with happy pride in remembrance of that superb specimen of perfect manhood six feet high--his Jack, to whom he had given the ""eddication.""",f
36511,"They watched the rest of the race with little interest, for the best of it all had gone by.",f
36512,"When the last rider crossed the tape, the multitude stirred to go.",f
36513,"""We better stand right here, Hannah, till some of these folks gets away,"" he said.",f
36514,So they stood perfectly still and let the crowd surge around them.,f
36515,"Then a great huzza went up, the track cleared again, as if by magic, and down the course came a dozen men, shouting in unrestrained joy.",f
36516,"Aloft on their shoulders they held--the old people craned their necks to see--yes, Jack--their Jack--looking sheepish and very much ashamed.",f
36517,"""Why, Mother,"" the old man cried, ""he's won!",f
36518,Our Jack's won the race!,f
36519,"Do you hear?""",f
36520,"Mother's eyes were fixed on the black and orange sweater, for Jack was once again in regulation bicycle attire, and her heart was too full to trust itself for speech.",f
36521,"""Three cheers for Gardner!",f
36522,"'Rah for the South Shore Club!"" and the great field swelled and swelled again with bursts of applause.",f
36523,And then--the crowd parted some way and Jack saw those pathetic faces upturned to him.,f
36524,"It is said that when a man is drowning, in the flash of a second his whole previous life passes in review.",f
36525,Something like this came to him at the crowning moment of his twenty-three years.,f
36526,"At that minute he knew, as never before, how those hands had toiled for him, how those lips had prayed for him, and how those honest hearts had loved him ever since he was born.",f
36527,"A sudden lump came into his throat, for he seemingly had withheld the only reward they wanted for it all.",f
36528,"""Let me down, fellows,"" he cried, ""there's my folks.""",f
36529,"Almost before they knew what had happened, he had rushed up to them with hands outstretched.",f
36530,"""Why, Father!",f
36531,"Mother!"" he exclaimed;",f
36532,"""why didn't you let me know you wanted to come?""",f
36533,"Just a minute the old people doubted the wisdom of their course, then the gladness in Jack's face set all at rest.",f
36534,"The men from the South Shore Club gathered around and were presented, one by one.",f
36535,"They shook hands with the old gentleman and told them how proud they were of Jack, and doffed their caps to Mrs. Gardner, ""just z's if I was a fine lady,"" she said afterward.",f
36536,Then Jack said everybody was going down to the club for lunch and his father and mother must come too.,f
36537,"""No, no!"" gasped Mrs. Gardner in affright;",f
36538,"""no! no!""",f
36539,"""Well, indeed you are coming,"" said Jack, with a charming air of proprietorship.",f
36540,"""I guess when a fellow wins the race of the year that his father and mother will go to lunch with him.""",f
36541,"Then he squeezed her thin wrinkled hand and whispered tenderly: ""Dear little mother!",f
36542,"To think you wanted to come, and I didn't know!""",f
36543,"The hero of the day turned to those who were with him: ""Will some of you fellows get a carriage?",f
36544,"I don't think I want any more bicycle riding to-day and I'll go down with my father and mother if one of you boys will lead my wheel.""",f
36545,"It was an enchanted journey for the old people to roll down the broad smooth boulevard in a real carriage, with Jack sitting in front of them telling them all about the race.",f
36546,"The President of the South Shore Club, the son of a man known and honoured throughout Chicago, had asked to be presented, and said he hoped Jack's father would be willing to be his guest for the day.",f
36547,"""I told him father would be pleased,"" concluded Jack, ""and he wanted mother too, but I said I guessed not, that I was going to have my little mother for my own guest.""",f
36548,"At last, when the carriage stopped before an imposing brown stone house, Jack helped them out, and entered the club with the shabby little brown figure on his arm.",f
36549,"""Just wait here a few minutes,"" he said, ""until I make myself presentable.""",f
36550,"He stationed them on a luxurious sofa, and ran off to the dressing-rooms.",f
36551,The old man looked after him fondly.,f
36552,"""I didn't think Jack would be ashamed of us, Mother,"" he said.",f
36553,"""No, Father, and he ain't.""",f
36554,"""My, ain't this a grand place?""",f
36555,"Half awed, they gazed at the rich furnishings in silence.",f
36556,"""Seems like heaven don't it?"" he murmured.",f
36557,"""Makes me think more of the chapter in Solomon,"" she replied.",f
36558,"""How's that, Mother?""",f
36559,"The little old lady looked up at him, her face shining with ineffable happiness, and repeated softly:  ""'_He led me into his banqueting house, and his banner over me was love._'""     The House Beautiful     The House Beautiful   Four years at College had given Jack Hardy high ambitions, but two years in society had perceptibly lowered them.",f
36560,Jack had inherited enough money to make him a prize in the matrimonial lottery and he was not slow to see that the reason of it lay in his bank account.,f
36561,"With a singular lack of conceit, he did not admit, even to himself, his personal charms.",f
36562,"Walking home one evening from a large reception, his indignation rapidly developed into a moving force, and in a sudden flash of insight he saw two paths which lay straight before him.",f
36563,"One was smooth, leading to gardens of pleasure; the other rough, toilsome, and strewn with failures, but at the end of it was a goal well worth working for.",f
36564,"His inheritance was all he needed to enter one; but on the other hand, hard, unfaltering work lay before him and was the only way to success.",f
36565,His strong young face was set in lines of unwonted determination.,f
36566,"""Farewell to an idle society life,"" he said aloud, ""here's to hard work, self-respect, and perhaps an honourable name.""",f
36567,"There was not a little comment in his set when it became known that Hardy had left town without assigning any reasons, length of stay, or even leaving an address.",f
36568,He retired to an obscure hamlet on the Jersey coast and secured a room in a rambling old house which faced the sea.,f
36569,"Here he could work; he could study hard, or write, and become, perhaps, a strong man intellectually, instead of being a fastidious ornament in a drawing-room where he felt his financial value was the key-note to his popularity.",f
36570,"The white-haired mistress of the mansion, however, had a confession to make which did not agree at all with his inclinations.",f
36571,"""I've got another boarder,"" she said, ""but she's a quiet, nice-appearing girl and I guess she won't disturb you any.""",f
36572,"""Girl!""",f
36573,"Hardy scowled, then recovered himself.",f
36574,"""Please, don't take any more boarders,"" he said smilingly, ""I'll make it worth your while.""",f
36575,"When he said ""please"" women instinctively obeyed him.",f
36576,"Mrs. Kitson readily promised to abstain from further extension of the hilarious pastime of taking boarders, which she had hitherto found to be necessary to her pocket-book, if not to her inclinations.",f
36577,He spent the afternoon in getting his traps settled in his new location.,f
36578,"The quiet was broken only by the boom of the breakers on the shore below, and the room was guiltless of sofa pillows and photograph frames with which women are wont to burden a helpless bachelor.",f
36579,He felt a certain sense of emancipation.,f
36580,"It was rather awkward having a girl around, and he contemplated the propriety of bribing Mrs. Kitson to invent some excuse for dispensing with her presence.",f
36581,"Some country damsel, he reflected, perhaps a seamstress, or a teacher who ""boarded round.""",f
36582,He determined to treat her with cool politeness while he might be forced to endure her proximity.,f
36583,Going down to supper he encountered the other boarder in the sitting-room.,f
36584,"His hostess, rather uncertain as to the proper form of introduction, mumbled something he did not quite understand.",f
36585,"He did not wish to appear at all concerned anyway, and bowed distantly.",f
36586,Miss Wheeler's dark eyes flashed and the colour came into her face.,f
36587,"He noted the signs of resentment and wondered what he had done; not that he cared, particularly, only one should always be polite.",f
36588,The supper was delicious.,f
36589,Everything was well cooked and well served.,f
36590,The china was dainty and the linen spotless.,f
36591,"Under the kindly influence of food which proverbially melts the masculine heart, Hardy began to look occasionally, and with some curiosity at the girl opposite him.",f
36592,"She was tall, and well formed, her head well poised, and her voice, when she spoke, was agreeably modulated.",f
36593,"She must be the teacher who ""boarded round.""",f
36594,She was apparently unconscious of his presence.,f
36595,"She drew Mrs. Kitson into volumes of personal reminiscence which prevented any awkward silence, and when they had finished, went with the hostess into the kitchen and helped her wash the dishes.",f
36596,"Hardy stood aloof for a moment, and then went up-stairs.",f
36597,He was accustomed to having girls all smiles and attention when he graciously consented to appear.,f
36598,"This one, however, could not have been more politely unconcerned if he had been a door-mat!",f
36599,"""She doesn't know,"" he began unconsciously, as the dull red flooded his face.",f
36600,"""No, and she never shall!""",f
36601,"With that desire for achievement which pique inspires, he went to work.",f
36602,"He had a dim notion of writing a story, such as he used to do for a college paper, but it eventually became a short sketch, half humorous and half cynical in tone.",f
36603,"When it was finished, he went out to send it off.",f
36604,He knew the street number of only one publication--a thing he had bought on the way down to appease the business instincts of the energetic and persistent train boy.,f
36605,"When he returned, he glanced through the window of the sitting-room as he stepped upon the broad, old-fashioned veranda.",f
36606,"There was no light except the driftwood fire in the big fireplace, and Miss Wheeler sat in a low chair watching it.",f
36607,It was an earnest womanly face full of purpose and aspiration.,f
36608,"The repressed energy, which he had first noticed in her manner, was gone.",f
36609,"She was off her guard, and her eyes were those of a wistful child, softened and made tender by her dreaming.",f
36610,"When he went down to breakfast the next morning, he learned that Miss Wheeler had taken her bicycle and gone off to spend the day.",f
36611,"With a little tact, he diverted Mrs. Kitson's conversation to herself.",f
36612,"He did not wish to take an unfair advantage, and besides he was not at all interested.",f
36613,"It was a long day, for he did not feel like work, so he tramped through the fields, sat on the sea shore, read a little, envied the consolation other men seemed to find in smoking, and was conscious of a new interest in life, when, just at dusk, Miss Wheeler rode up and dismounted at the gate.",f
36614,"Mrs. Kitson's penetrating voice rang out clearly, and rose to his room.",f
36615,"""How fur did you ride?""",f
36616,"Miss Wheeler was bending over her cyclometer, but her reply was inaudible.",f
36617,"""Hey?""",f
36618,"""Twenty-three miles.""",f
36619,Her young voice was clear and strong this time.,f
36620,"At supper he watched her closely for symptoms of weariness, but she was fresh and rosy, and unaffectedly hungry.",f
36621,"She still wore her bicycle suit, and talked pleasantly with Mrs. Kitson.",f
36622,"She answered Hardy's questions, to be sure, but it was in monosyllables.",f
36623,"""She must have the strength of an Amazon,"" he mused, as he sat by the fire while she was helping Mrs. Kitson with the dishes, and laughing occasionally in a happy childlike way.",f
36624,"A ten-mile ride would utterly exhaust any girl he knew, and she apparently considered twice that distance merely a pleasant outing!",f
36625,She came in after a while and sat on the other side of the hearth.,f
36626,"Mrs. Kitson with many apologies, had gone ""visitin'.""",f
36627,After an awkward silence he laughed outright--the boyish hearty laugh that won him friends everywhere.,f
36628,"""Are you going to keep it all to yourself?"" she asked smiling.",f
36629,"""I was thinking,"" he returned, ""of what the Autocrat said when some one asked him to define happiness.""",f
36630,She dimpled prettily.,f
36631,"""Yes, I know.",f
36632,"'Four feet on a fender.'""  Hers were not so far away but that the contrast in size was evident.",f
36633,The ice was broken.,f
36634,"""And are you happy?"" he inquired tentatively.",f
36635,"""Why shouldn't I be?"" she answered.",f
36636,"""I've got a sound body, a clear brain, an honest name and a clean heart.",f
36637,"Isn't that enough?""",f
36638,She looked up smiling.,f
36639,"He hesitated, for her point of view was new to him.",f
36640,"""Most people would include money in the list, I've got all the things you say make you happy, and yet----""  ""You haven't the money.""",f
36641,She had finished his sentence for him.,f
36642,"""You don't look as if it bothered you a great deal,"" she added shyly.",f
36643,He was silent.,f
36644,For once he had been separated from his birthright and considered apart from his inheritance.,f
36645,The sensation was distinctly novel.,f
36646,"""Do you ever think,"" she went on, ""of the house you would build if you had all the money you wanted?""",f
36647,"""I used to, when I was a very little boy,"" he answered with an effort.",f
36648,"""I do even now, it's one of my daydreams and I call it my House Beautiful,"" she said.",f
36649,"He asked a timid question and something of the expression he had seen on her face in the firelight the evening before, returned to it.",f
36650,"Had she been dreaming of her ""House Beautiful"" then?",f
36651,The mellow tones of her voice sounded full and soft in his ears.,f
36652,She was telling of a house of grey stone with wide porches and massive columns.,f
36653,"She spoke of the reception hall, the stately stairway, and the tiger skin rug in the drawing-room.",f
36654,"A tower room with windows facing both the sunset and the sea, beautiful things in costly woods, and fabrics in white and gold.",f
36655,"He was interested, in spite of himself, and began to help her plan it.",f
36656,"There was no difference of opinion, even in the smallest detail, and room by room, and floor by floor, they furnished their imaginary castle.",f
36657,"On the very top of the tower, the Stars and Stripes would always flutter--""because it's the most beautiful flag in the world,"" with a little choke in her voice, ""and it means the most.""",f
36658,"Only a week before he had attended that offensive reception, and he was thinking of the contrast now.",f
36659,"The men that night had spoken with an affected English drawl, and the girls were all ""going abroad for the summer.""",f
36660,"And to-night he had forgotten his bank and mining stocks, and was sitting by a driftwood fire with a girl who had childish dreams of building a house, and choked when she spoke of the flag.",f
36661,"""And the doors should open forever, and ever, to all who had done anything noble in the world, or had tried to do it.""",f
36662,"With a little lingering sigh, she stretched her white hands towards the flames.",f
36663,"The House Beautiful was finished, but she was still dreaming.",f
36664,"He repeated her thought mentally: ""The doors should be open forever, and ever, to all who had done anything noble in the world, or had _tried_ to do it.""",f
36665,Would that bar him out?,f
36666,He turned uneasily in his chair.,f
36667,"Mrs. Kitson returned, and he felt that he must say something: ""You should have gone to college,"" he ventured, in a tone which was meant to be both fatherly and cheerful.",f
36668,She rose smilingly and bade him good night.,f
36669,"""I am a graduate of Vassar,"" she said simply.",f
36670,"A day or two later his heart fluttered gladly when the mail brought him a check for his sketch, and a request to submit further manuscript.",f
36671,"He shut himself up in his room for a whole day and tried to work, but a far-away clack-clack grated on his nerves and made him irritable.",f
36672,He went off for a tramp and on his return found Miss Wheeler sitting on the porch.,f
36673,"""Did you hear that constant clatter this afternoon?"" he asked.",f
36674,"""Yes, it was my typewriter,"" she answered demurely.",f
36675,She was evidently a stenographer.,f
36676,"""I'm sorry,"" said Hardy awkwardly, ""but it disturbs me.""",f
36677,"Then with more innocent joy than foolish pride, he continued:  ""I--ah--write, you know.""",f
36678,Miss Wheeler gathered up her books.,f
36679,"""I regret that it annoys you,"" she said frigidly, ""but I cannot help it.""",f
36680,"Then with an exact imitation of his tone and manner, she added: ""I--ah--write, you know.""",f
36681,And then she left him alone.,f
36682,Hardy had business in town of such a pressing nature that he could not even stop to tell Mrs. Kitson that he was going.,f
36683,"He sent her a telegram from the station, saying he did not know when he would be able to return.",f
36684,"The gay streets of the city, brilliantly lighted, even in the early evening, were full of allurement, as they always are, to one who has been away.",f
36685,But a higher impulse within him was striving with the one that demanded pleasure.,f
36686,He would go back.,f
36687,"So he bought some magazines, and sat down to wait for the outgoing train, the very next day.",f
36688,"He cut the leaves mechanically, and dipped here and there into the pages.",f
36689,"Then the title of a story caught his attention, and he read it to the finish.",f
36690,"It was a simple tale, told with no striving after effect, but the lines were broadly human, and it rang true.",f
36691,"The signature was ""Constance Wheeler.""",f
36692,The consciousness of his own caddishness came home to him like a blow.,f
36693,"They had a long talk the next day, and he told her what he was trying to do.",f
36694,"""But you discourage me,"" he said.",f
36695,"""I never can do it as you do.""",f
36696,"They were sitting by the sea, watching the sunset as the rich colours came over from the west, and touched the waves with tints of opal.",f
36697,"""I've been doing it three or four years,"" she said, ""and you are just beginning.""",f
36698,Then with unknowing comprehension she went on.,f
36699,"""Besides, what one accomplishes, doesn't matter in the least.",f
36700,"It's the work that makes men and women of us.""",f
36701,"The light which was reflected back from the surf made her face tender then, and leaning forward, with a simple reverence which she could not misunderstand, he kissed her hand.",f
36702,The summer promised to be all too short.,f
36703,They studied and read together and criticised each other's work.,f
36704,"Hardy was fond of rowing, so they spent many hours together on the water.",f
36705,"Constance sat on a cushion in the stern and read aloud, while Jack pulled vigorously or let the boat drift idly, as best suited his mood.",f
36706,"One day the book was absorbingly interesting, and one of the oars slipped into the softly-lapping water, and set out for lands unknown.",f
36707,Constance saw it first and her face changed.,f
36708,"His eyes followed hers, but he sat quite still for a moment.",f
36709,They were but a mile from shore and the tide was going in.,f
36710,"""We'll go in with it,"" she said bravely.",f
36711,"With the remaining oar Hardy turned the boat so as to catch the full force of the shoreward impulse, but in a very few minutes they saw the tide would not do as they wished.",f
36712,A sudden cloud obscured the sun.,f
36713,The wind shifted and grew cold.,f
36714,"Quick to act in an emergency, Jack took off his coat and shoes and tied the anchor rope under his arms.",f
36715,In an instant she saw what he was going to do.,f
36716,"""No--no, Jack,"" she pleaded.",f
36717,It was the first time she had ever called him Jack.,f
36718,The sky was threatening and the wind was growing stronger.,f
36719,"""Constance, dearest,"" he said tenderly, ""there is no other way.""",f
36720,He sprang into the water and struck out with long powerful strokes for the shore.,f
36721,"As if conscious of its precious burden, the boat followed slowly and steadily, then more slowly, then in fitful jerks.",f
36722,They were half-way to the shore but Jack's strength was failing fast.,f
36723,"The sky grew darker, and there was a sullen roar of thunder.",f
36724,"Constance knelt in the stern, took off her dress and shoes, and took down her hair.",f
36725,"She slipped into the water just as the storm broke, and Jack was gasping when she swam up beside him.",f
36726,"""It's a cramp,"" he said weakly.",f
36727,"""I know.",f
36728,"Can you slip the rope over your head?""",f
36729,She held him up while he obeyed.,f
36730,The sea was rising and she felt her strength to the full.,f
36731,The boat drifted away and still holding him up she put the braids of her hair into his hands.,f
36732,"As a drowning man will catch at a straw, he clutched it, then sank almost into unconsciousness, but still held with spasmodic grasp to the only hope within his hands.",f
36733,"It was too dark now to see the shore, but Constance struggled on, keeping his head above the water as best she could.",f
36734,"She rested from time to time by floating and spending only strength enough to keep them from being carried out to sea, but she was rapidly becoming exhausted.",f
36735,"At last, when she was too weak to swim another stroke, she sank despairingly, and found the firm ground under her feet.",f
36736,"It was easy then, and she half dragged him ashore.",f
36737,"When she awoke out of what seemed a horrible dream, she was in her own room, and Mrs. Kitson was bustling about her with motherly solicitude.",f
36738,"Jack was kneeling beside her, and when she opened her eyes, his were shining with the ""light that was never on land or sea,"" as he took her hand.",f
36739,"An answering glow crept into her face and he stooped, unafraid, to her lips.",f
36740,There was no need of words between them--love went to meet love with open arms.,f
36741,"As soon as she was able to sit up, they made plans for their future.",f
36742,"""Just our two pens, Jack,"" she said happily, ""to buy everything we want.",f
36743,"But we won't want much else, if we have each other.""",f
36744,"A lump rose in his throat, but it was not yet time to tell her.",f
36745,"He went to the city every day now, ""on business,"" as he said, and as the summer faded, and the leaves turned crimson and gold, Constance began her wedding gown.",f
36746,"She put so many hopes and fancies into it with the tiny careful stitches she took that had the white not been senseless, it must have turned to rose under her hands.",f
36747,They were married in a little church on a glorious autumn day.,f
36748,"""I think it's the last day,"" she said;",f
36749,"""the summer only just waited for us.""",f
36750,"He would not tell her where the wedding journey was to be, and she showed little curiosity.",f
36751,"""I don't care where we go,"" she said as they left the house for the last time, ""only you mustn't be extravagant.""",f
36752,"It was not until the train stopped at a little town by the sea, and very near the city, that he gave her any hint of his plans.",f
36753,They had taken a carriage and driven down a beautiful winding road.,f
36754,He waved his hand towards a distant hill.,f
36755,"""That is where we are going,"" he said.",f
36756,"""It's rather a pretty place,"" indifferently.",f
36757,"""I think you'll like it.""",f
36758,"She saw a stately mansion of grey stone, with wide porches and massive tower, and where he knew the reception hall and the stately stairway were just as she would wish her own house to be--even the tiger skin rug in the drawing-room, and the beautiful things in costly woods, and fabrics of white and gold.",f
36759,"He could stand it no longer and leaned towards her, thrilling with an unspeakable tenderness.",f
36760,"""Heart of mine,"" he whispered, ""haven't you guessed it?""",f
36761,"From a Human Standpoint     From a Human Standpoint   ""Will the madam please walk in to supper?""",f
36762,"Carroll stood in the doorway with a napkin over his arm, the very picture of servile obedience.",f
36763,"Katherine sprang from the sofa, saying laughingly, ""Indeed the madam will!""",f
36764,"His obsequious manner changed at once, and he put his arm around her waist with a happy sense of proprietorship.",f
36765,"The table was cosily laid for two, linen and china were of the daintiest, and the tiny kettle swung and bubbled merrily over the alcohol lamp.",f
36766,"""How dear and homey it all is!""",f
36767,"Katherine exclaimed, as she sat down.",f
36768,"""And how primitive,"" suggested Robert.",f
36769,"""But our respective professions are not worth much if our imaginations can't change our tea into a banquet.",f
36770,"Will you have a little of the quail?""",f
36771,He poised a mutton chop on his fork and looked inquiringly at Katherine.,f
36772,"""I'm afraid quail is too rich for me to-night,"" she answered, ""but I will take a little of the toast which is commonly supposed to go with it, and some of the nectar which I shall brew myself.""",f
36773,"""Lucky thing you don't like cream with your nectar,"" he responded, ""for the cat got into it this afternoon.",f
36774,"I'm afraid I neglect my housewifely duties for my art.""",f
36775,"""That doesn't matter, as long as art progresses.",f
36776,"Did Mickey behave to-day?""",f
36777,"Mickey was the name Katherine had given to Carroll's model, who was posing for his ""Aurora.""",f
36778,"She had the fair skin and blue eyes with which Ireland compensates her daughters for a somewhat unlovely mouth, and her hair was a flaming auburn glory which he tried in vain to paint.",f
36779,It was a little startling until you knew Mickey.,f
36780,"People who could pass hundreds without noting age, colour, or condition of servitude, would stop and gasp as she went by.",f
36781,But those who were privileged to know her intimately became so absorbed in contemplation of her manifold character that mere externals were passed unnoticed.,f
36782,"""Mickey did pretty well to-day,"" he said.",f
36783,"""She put on your best hat while I was out, and I found her strutting before the mirror when I came back.",f
36784,"I declare to you, solemnly, Katherine, that the effect of your violets against that hair was absolutely _fortissimo_.",f
36785,She will wear it to church some day if we don't watch her.,f
36786,"But she didn't cut my brushes into scallops, nor assist in the painting when my back was turned.",f
36787,"No, on the whole Mickey has been angelic.",f
36788,"How did things go with you?""",f
36789,"""About as usual, though I believe more than the usual number of freaky people have been in.",f

36791,"They seem to think that a woman tied down to a newspaper desk, has only to beckon and the universe hastens to do her bidding.",f
36792,"You remember I told you about the woman who came in last week with a yearning to do 'lit'ery work'?""",f
36793,Robert nodded.,f
36794,"""She was in again to-day.",f
36795,She is doing 'lit'ery work' and likes it very much.,f

36802,"Together they washed up the dishes, then Robert hung the dish-towel out of the window to dry, and took off his apron.",f
36803,"In the studio was an open fire, the single extravagance which the Carrolls allowed themselves.",f
36804,"Perhaps it was not so extravagant after all, since it saved gas, and Robert picked up most of the wood in his daily walks along the lake shore.",f
36805,"""Let's sit on the rug,"" said Katherine, and they curled up like two children before the fire.",f
36806,"Robert rested his head upon his elbow, and looked up contentedly into her face.",f
36807,"The sweetness of it was half hidden, half revealed, by the dancing firelight, but there were lines around the mouth, and faint marks of worry on the forehead.",f
36808,"Yet, it was a patient face--one to teach a man strength and kindliness.",f
36809,"The hand that wore the wedding ring was thin, so thin that the ring slipped when she moved her fingers.",f

36817,Katherine's father had proved himself the equal if not the superior of any stern parent in fiction.,f
36818,"A stormy scene followed the announcement of her determination to marry the man of her own choice, rather than his, so they had slipped away to Milwaukee--that haven of the fond and foolish--and set up housekeeping immediately on their return.",f
36819,"Robert had objected a little to the announcement cards, since they were not in a position to entertain, but they were sent out.",f
36820,"Upon the receipt of his, Katherine's father had written a single line: ""Any time you may repent of this foolishness, your home is open to you.""",f
36821,The avalanche of gifts had followed the wedding instead of preceding it.,f
36822,"The usual miscellany of the very rich had been showered upon them, and Katherine had often thought of the exquisite irony involved in the possession of gold candlesticks, real laces, a Royal Worcester chocolate set, and a genuine Corot, while her shoes were out at the toes and Robert's clothes were sadly frayed.",f
36823,"Still, eight months had passed and she had not repented of her foolishness.",f
36824,"He still seemed more desirable than money, and she looked fondly at the Corot which hung in the place of honour.",f
36825,"""I cleaned all the silver to-day,"" he said, ""and put our cut glass punch bowl safely out of Mickey's reach.""",f
36826,She patted his cheek affectionately.,f
36827,"""You're a dear good boy, and an admirable housekeeper.""",f
36828,"""Katherine, I can't stand it any longer,"" he blurted out.",f
36829,"""I simply won't stay here and paint while you work your dear fingers to the bone in that confounded old office.",f
36830,"It's my business to take care of you, not yours of me, and here you are, working like a slave, while I do the elegant leisure at home.",f
36831,"It's simply infamous!""",f
36832,"""Hubby, dear,"" and Katherine's tone was commanding.",f
36833,"""I won't let you abuse yourself like that.",f
36834,"In the first place you are working just as hard as I am, with your painting and keeping things cosy here, and accomplishing just as much.",f
36835,And it's only for a little while.,f
36836,"As soon as your picture is done, you'll sell it, and I'll resign and do the housekeeping myself.",f
36837,You know how gladly you would do the same for me; why won't you let me do it for you?,f
36838,"Don't you love me well enough to let me help you?""",f
36839,"""Katherine!",f
36840,"Katherine!"" he cried, ""don't say that!",f

36845,In these last days of despondency the lake had grown into a companion with seeming sympathy for every mood of his.,f
36846,The vast expanse of water seemed to broaden his horizon.,f
36847,"Whenever he looked at it, it suggested a letting-go of all but the vital things.",f
36848,"There was only one thing that was vital, and she slept in the little room beyond.",f
36849,"Even his art counted for nothing beside her, but she believed in it, and he must make something of it to please her.",f
36850,"The shadows deepened until even the gold candlesticks ceased to shine, and he went to the window.",f
36851,"Slow, sombre, and restless, old Michigan chafed against the shore.",f
36852,"At times those cold arms beckoned him with compelling strength, and it was so to-night.",f
36853,"Katherine would go home to her father, and, in time, forget him.",f
36854,"He pulled down the shade, shuddering as he did so, and at last fell asleep with a consciousness of utter defeat.",f

36861,"It was Mickey in the yard below, blarneying with the milk boy.",f
36862,"The voices awoke Carroll, and he discovered it was very late, indeed, and that Katherine had gone down-town without waking him.",f
36863,"There was a line pinned to the cushion: ""Good-bye, dearest.",f
36864,"K.""",f
36865,Mickey appeared at the back door while he was finishing his breakfast.,f
36866,"With unheard-of kindness, she offered to put things right in the studio, and he left her in charge with some misgivings.",f
36867,"But the marketing had to be done, and it would be impossible to work rightly without a breath of fresh air.",f
36868,When he returned every chair was set demurely and properly against the wall and Mickey sat on the floor with his cherished portfolio of Gibson pictures in her lap.,f
36869,"He repressed an angry exclamation, and ordered her, somewhat sternly, to put them back.",f
36870,She complied readily.,f
36871,"""It's cross yez are this morning, Misther Carroll.",f
36872,"Thim pictures ain't got no paint on 'em, but I'm thinkin' they do be better wans than thim ye're afther makin'!""",f
36873,Carroll made no reply.,f
36874,"It was quite true that the Gibson pictures were better than his, even without paint, but he did not relish her impartial announcement of the fact.",f
36875,"The light was good, and he worked steadily for an hour, at the end of which time Mickey announced the necessity for her immediate departure.",f
36876,In vain he protested and pleaded.,f
36877,"The picture was nearly done, and only a few more sittings would be needed.",f
36878,"But Mickey was ""goin' to the theayter wid a coosin--"" and she went.",f
36879,So he put the house in order and decided he would make a cake for supper.,f
36880,"He had never done anything of the kind, and Katherine found him still deep in the problem when she returned.",f
36881,"He couldn't find the cook-book, he said, so he just threw a few things in, the way she did when she made cake.",f
36882,"It was going to be light too, for he had put in half a cupful of baking powder.",f
36883,Katherine laughed until the tears rolled down her cheeks.,f
36884,"It was a mean woman, Robert said, who would go down-town and leave her husband with no cook-book!",f
36885,"She pointed it out to him on the corner of the shelf, and he twisted his mustache thoughtfully, forgetting the flour with which his hand was covered.",f
36886,"It took them both to make him presentable again, and then Katherine threw the cake away, and in a very few minutes made the lightest, most wonderful biscuit that ever gave a man the dyspepsia.",f
36887,"Mickey was faithful during the following week, and the ""Aurora"" was finished almost to his satisfaction.",f
36888,"It was placed on sale in a Wabash Avenue gallery, and they anxiously watched the newspapers for notices.",f
36889,"None came, however, and Robert became despondent.",f
36890,"An idea came to Katherine, and she went with fear and trembling to the art critic of the _Express_, whose judgment was accepted as law and gospel.",f
36891,"Unlike most women she came to the point at once: ""Mr. Lester,"" she said, ""my husband has a picture on exhibition at Stanley & Brown's, and a favourable notice would mean much to us both.",f
36892,"None of the papers have spoken of it, and I have been wondering if you could not help us a little.""",f
36893,"Philosophers have not yet determined why a woman feels free to ask anything of a rejected lover, nor why men so willingly grant favours to women whom they have loved in vain.",f
36894,"""Mrs. Carroll,"" Lester replied, ""I should be only too glad to be of service to either you or your husband, but I have seen the picture, and I cannot conscientiously speak favourably of it.",f
36895,"In fact, I had written a roast, and out of consideration to you burned it up.""",f
36896,Katherine's face fell and her eyes filled.,f
36897,"He was afraid she was going to cry, and he went on--""But I'll tell you what I will do.",f
36898,"I am called out of the city to-morrow, and it is the day for my notes;",f
36899,I'll ask Carleton to let you do my work.,f
36900,"You can write what you please.""",f
36901,She clutched the friendly straw gladly.,f
36902,"""You are very, very good.",f
36903,"But please tell me what is the matter with the picture.""",f
36904,"""Only one thing, Mrs. Carroll; it lacks humanity.",f
36905,Pictures must be painted from a human standpoint.,f
36906,No doubt you will see what I mean if you will look at it critically.,f
36907,"I haven't time to stop any longer now, but I'll tell Carleton.""",f
36908,"An hour later, Katherine was summoned to the office of the managing editor.",f
36909,"""Mrs. Carroll,"" he said, ""Lester tells me he is called out of the city and suggests you as the proper person to do his work.",f
36910,"I believe it is a little out of your line, but you can try.",f
36911,"Miss Scott will do your department to-day, and you can take this afternoon to look around.""",f
36912,So the newly fledged art critic went out to find her copy.,f
36913,"There were several pictures to be noted and she spoke as kindly as she could of all, trying to mingle helpful criticism with discerning praise.",f
36914,"None were condemned, for she knew what a picture might mean to the artist, and to the woman who loved him.",f
36915,"Unconsciously, she imitated Lester's style; his full, well-rounded periods, and sharp, incisive sentences.",f
36916,"Very different it was from the chatty, gossipy way in which she filled the ""Woman's Kingdom,"" on the back page of the _Express_.",f
36917,"She was afraid to say too much of Robert's work, and toned down her enthusiasm three successive times.",f
36918,The last note satisfied her and she sent it up-stairs with the rest.,f
36919,"When the paper came in the morning, he turned feverishly to the page which contained the ""Art of the Week.""",f
36920,"His shout of joy woke Katherine and together they laughed and cried over the ""good notice.""",f
36921,"She felt wicked, but his pleasure was full compensation for her pangs of conscience.",f
36922,"""Lester's approval is worth a thousand dollars,"" he said.",f
36923,"""I can go to work in earnest now.""",f
36924,Her face changed mysteriously.,f
36925,"An overwhelming sense of the wrong she had done, came upon her, and he looked at her steadily.",f
36926,"There was a queer note in his voice when he spoke: ""Katherine Carroll, I believe you wrote that notice.""",f
36927,It was useless to dissemble longer and she told the whole story.,f
36928,"He was deeply touched by this proof of her devotion, but he shook his head sadly over Lester's own comment.",f
36929,"""It won't help any, little girl; you can't make fame for me in that way.",f
36930,"My work must stand or fall on its own merits--and--it seems likely to fall.""",f
36931,"She tried to comfort him, but he put her away.",f
36932,"""No, it's all wrong.",f
36933,"I'm going to give it up, and try something else.""",f
36934,"After she had gone, he put his easel and paints away, and set the house in order.",f
36935,"Then he went into the city, as so many have done before, to find work, which seems little enough to ask in so great a world.",f
36936,"At five he returned, utterly tired and cast down.",f
36937,He had tramped the streets for hours and had found absolutely nothing to do.,f
36938,"Half unconsciously, he turned to the window--to the vision of the lake which had meant strength before, but it brought only weakness now.",f
36939,"""Come,--come--come--"" the waves seemed to say--instead of being cold and cruel, they were promising infinite rest.",f
36940,And it meant a luxurious home for Katherine.,f
36941,"His decision was quickly made, and he wrote a tender note to leave for her.",f
36942,He sobbed over that--for it wasn't like painting--he was putting his heart into it.,f
36943,"Then down to the inland sea he went, those impatient arms beckoning him still.",f
36944,But Katherine had felt in the office that something was wrong with Robert.,f
36945,"A pang of sudden fear made it impossible for her to work any longer, and she hurried home.",f
36946,"She found the note at once, and seeing only the ""good-bye"" at the end she hastened to the door.",f
36947,"""Robert, Robert!"" she called, but he was too far away to hear her.",f
36948,"And Katherine ran, crying as she went, ""Dear God, make me in time!""",f
36949,"He stood at the end of the pier, old and decayed as it was, and looked at the sea and sky for the last time.",f
36950,"The sunset gates behind him, royally beautiful with purple and gold, seemed a glimpse of the heaven he hardly hoped to reach, for though he knew that God was infinitely merciful, he knew that He was also infinitely just.",f
36951,"He took off his coat and laid it on the pier, just as Katherine, breathless, excited, her face tense with appeal, appeared beside him.",f
36952,"His eyes lighted for a moment at the sight of her, then returned to their dull, hopeless look.",f
36953,"""It's no use, Katherine,"" he said unsteadily, ""go back, darling.""",f
36954,"""Not alone, dearest.""",f
36955,"""Yes, Katherine,"" he kissed her sadly.",f
36956,"For minutes which seemed like hours, she stood there arguing, pleading, begging in vain.",f
36957,It was best for her--that was his one thought.,f
36958,"He was a dull, dead weight upon her; it was right to make her free.",f
36959,And the blue arms beckoned still.,f
36960,Suddenly she drew his face down to hers and whispered to him.,f
36961,What she said seemed to rouse him from himself.,f
36962,"""Really?""",f
36963,"""Yes, really.",f
36964,"Can you leave me now?""",f
36965,Something more than the glory of the sunset shone in Katherine's face as she stood between him and the water.,f
36966,"She was subtly beautiful, with the infinite motherhood, which lives in every woman's heart, and as he looked at her, the shackles of his dead cowardly self fell away.",f
36967,"A great resolve within him slowly swelled into a controlling power--he would be worthy of her who stood beside him, cost what it might.",f
36968,His voice was tender and caressing when he spoke again.,f
36969,"""Leave you?",f
36970,"No, Katherine, no.""",f
36971,They walked home together and spoke of other things.,f
36972,"There was a stronger bond between them, and the water seemed cold and bitter now--very different from the eerie, half-human thing that had tempted him an hour ago.",f
36973,"He tossed restlessly through the night, thinking of what Lester had said about painting from a human standpoint.",f
36974,"Perhaps he meant that he should paint men and women, instead of goddesses.",f
36975,"The vision of Katherine came into his mind as she stood with the blue water behind her and the sunset upon her face and hair; her eyes full of earthly longing, and more than earthly appeal.",f
36976,"He would paint her like that, and he roused from his cowardly lethargy into high resolve.",f
36977,"Her salary was raised and she worked happily at the office, while Robert painted at home.",f
36978,"In the evening she sat and sewed on tiny garments for the human secret, which spring was to reveal.",f
36979,"He sat and looked at her, seldom speaking, content to watch the holy joy in her face, and either that or his coming fatherhood, sometimes thrilled him with a tenderness so great that his love was almost joy.",f
36980,"The ""Aurora"" had been sold, not for a large sum, it is true, but for enough to take care of them both until the new picture should be finished.",f
36981,It was done at last and placed on sale.,f
36982,"Painted from a human standpoint it undoubtedly was, and it drew many admirers but no purchaser.",f
36983,For four weeks it had been at the gallery and Robert began to grow despondent again.,f
36984,"A fall morning dawned, gray and dull, and the lake seemed to tremble with portent of coming disaster.",f
36985,At night the wind rose and lashed the water into seething foam.,f
36986,"The sound of the storm made Katherine afraid, but she sank into a fitful slumber at last, while Robert kept a light in the window, hoping none were at sea.",f
36987,But at half-past eleven there was a terrific rap at the door.,f
36988,"It was Mickey, disheveled and breathless.",f
36989,"""There do be a wreck, Misther Carroll,"" she cried, ""there's sky-rockets goin' off and the life crew be ordered out, and I thought ye'd be afther wantin' to see it.""",f
36990,The thing was evidently a circus for Mickey; we hold life so lightly at the age of sixteen.,f
36991,"Katherine, trembling and afraid, was already at the door.",f
36992,"She wrung her hands, crying piteously, ""Oh, Robert!",f
36993,"Robert! don't go.""",f
36994,"""I must go, sweetheart, they may need me.""",f
36995,"""Then I am going too.""",f
36996,And she began to hurry into her clothes.,f
36997,"""Dress warmly, dear,"" he called.",f
36998,"""Yes, I will, and we must take some blankets with us.""",f
36999,Once outside they had no difficulty in locating the wreck.,f
37000,"The northern sky was aflame with rockets, and people from all directions were hurrying northward.",f
37001,"The Northwestern University life crew was already on the beach trying to shoot a line to the sinking ship, half a mile from the shore.",f
37002,"The boat had been ordered back, for it was certain death in such a sea.",f
37003,"The fourth attempt was successful and a shout of joy went up, dimly heard above the storm.",f
37004,"Mickey danced about excitedly as they tied rope after rope of greater strength to the slender cord, that had been shot to the upper deck, but Katherine felt faint, even with her husband's arm around her, when they made preparations to pull the ship's life-boat ashore.",f
37005,"It required almost superhuman strength, but the rush of water westward aided them materially.",f
37006,"Katherine never forgot that time of waiting--human lives on shore struggling to save the human lives at sea, and the tense cruel crash of the cold waves.",f
37007,"Lifted high upon an angry crest, the boat was dashed heavily upon the beach.",f
37008,"The captain of the stranded vessel, eight seamen and one passenger, were helped out with eager hands.",f
37009,"The passenger was a middle-aged man, who appeared dignified and prosperous, in spite of his damp and disheveled condition.",f
37010,His first remark was in the nature of a recapitulation.,f
37011,"""Well, of all the excitin' trips!""",f
37012,"Robert and Katherine laughed in spite of themselves, and hastened to extend to the stranger the hospitality of their little home for the remainder of the night.",f
37013,"It was barely one o'clock, and the Honourable Mr. Marchand accepted gladly, if not gratefully.",f
37014,"He trudged sturdily along in the blankets they had wrapped around him, disdaining Robert's proffered assistance, but once stretched out upon their couch before a blazing fire, he became much more tractable.",f
37015,He called for a glass of whiskey complaining that what he had been through would be enough to kill him if he didn't at once supply this long-felt want of the inner man.,f
37016,"A telephone message to the nearest drug store brought the quart of stimulant he thought he needed for the night, and when he was comfortably filled with his favourite beverage, life began to assume a more pleasant aspect.",f
37017,He graphically told the story of the wreck to his interested listeners and then imbibed a little more liquid nourishment.,f
37018,"After a while he remarked sagely--""It's a lucky thing I didn't go down, some folks would have lost millions.""",f
37019,"""Is that so?"" asked Katherine pleasantly.",f
37020,"""Yes, _millions_!",f
37021,"Look here, young woman, did you ever hear of a syndicate?""",f
37022,Katherine thought she had heard the word somewhere.,f
37023,"""Well, I'm one of 'em!""",f
37024,"The whiskey was evidently getting in its work in the way of lubricating the tongue of the shipwrecked capitalist, and after waiting a moment, he continued:  ""I'm on my way to Chicago to perfect a combine in--"" and he astounded Katherine by unfolding the inside history of a daring and infamous combination--a gigantic steal, which if consummated, would change the ownership of millions.",f
37025,"He named the leading conspirators, explained the vulnerable points in the scheme, and gleefully boasted of his own skill and diplomacy.",f
37026,"He finally fell asleep, but not until Katherine had got all the necessary points concerning the outrageous robbery which had been so adroitly planned.",f
37027,Robert met her at the door.,f
37028,"""Got a scoop?""",f
37029,"""Well, I should say so.",f
37030,"A big one too!""",f
37031,"""How do you know it is true?""",f
37032,"""_In vino veritas_,"" whispered Katherine.",f
37033,"""Besides, Carleton told one of our night men the other day, that promotion was in store for the fellow who 'got on to' any of the schemes of this new syndicate.""",f
37034,She had heard so much newspaper slang that her lapse from the grammatical standard was perhaps pardonable.,f
37035,"Until nearly three o'clock she wrote hurriedly a description of the wreck, and also of the new ""combine,"" Robert dozing in an easy chair meanwhile.",f
37036,She woke him up to give him her manuscript.,f
37037,"""To the telegraph office, quick!",f
37038,"It'll be in time for the city edition.""",f
37039,"The Honourable Mr. Marchand slept late the next morning, and Katharine sent word to the office that she could not come until the next day.",f
37040,"About noon, however, their guest took his departure, apparently but little the worse for his vivid night's experience.",f
37041,At a corner he bought a copy of the morning's _Express_ and shortly thereafter leaned up against a wall for support.,f
37042,"""Gee whiz!""",f
37043,The Honourable Mr. Marchand mopped his brow and read the startling headlines again.,f
37044,"""Might as well go back to Cincinnati and Cleveland and Toronto, and all them towns I've just come from!",f
37045,"Wonder how in thunder the thing ever got out!""",f
37046,"He strolled down Wabash Avenue to collect his scattered thoughts, and stopped half mechanically, to look into Stanley & Brown's window.",f
37047,"Carroll's painting stared him full in the face, and a great light broke in upon him.",f
37048,"""That's her!",f
37049,That's the girl what done it!,f
37050,"Blamed if I don't like her for it!""",f
37051,That afternoon a messenger boy rapped at the studio door with a letter from the _Express_ office for Katherine.,f
37052,"""Dear Mrs. Carroll,"" it ran, ""we think you deserve a two weeks' vacation at full salary which is now double the former sum, and we beg you to accept the enclosed check as a slight testimonial of our gratitude for the biggest scoop of the year.",f
37053,"Please report for duty on the eighteenth, and be ready to take the exchange editor's desk.""",f
37054,She was dazed.,f
37055,"""Two weeks' vacation, double salary, promotion, and----""  Robert picked it up, it was a check for two hundred dollars.",f
37056,"During the jubilation which followed, a telegraph boy pounded vigorously at the door, but he might as well have kept still, since his efforts were unheard.",f
37057,"Finally he opened it, and utterly unabashed by the spectacle of a gentleman kissing a lady, and the lady seeming to enjoy it, he fairly shrieked: ""TELEGRAM.""",f
37058,"Katherine vanished instantly, and Carroll read the despatch.",f
37059,"""Picture sold for highest price.",f
37060,Purchaser unknown.,f
37061,"""STANLEY & BROWN.""",f
37062,"The mythical ""quail on toast"" became a reality that night, and the house seemed far too small to hold so much exuberant joy.",f
37063,"In the morning, they went together to Stanley & Brown's to collect the picture money, and start a ""really truly bank account,"" as Katherine said.",f
37064,"The firm was quite at a loss to know who the purchaser was, as he took the picture away with him in a carriage, and paid cash instead of by check, but the man who helped him put it on the back seat of the carriage reported that he had muttered to himself, as he was climbing in: ""That's her!",f
37065,"That's the girl what done it!""",f
37066,This may have given Mr. and Mrs. Carroll some clue to the identity of the unknown benefactor.,f
